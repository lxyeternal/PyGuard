  "purpose": "Dynamically loads a shared object (.so) file from the current directory and imports its attributes into the global namespace.",
  "sources": "The directory listing to find the .so file, the __file__ variable for current script location.",
  "sinks": "exec_module executes the external .so file, importing its attributes into globals.",
  "flows": "Directory listing -> find .so file -> load with ExtensionFileLoader -> execute module -> import attributes into globals.",
  "anomalies": "No validation or checksum verification of the .so file; no security checks; imports all non-private attributes into globals.",
  "analysis": "The code searches for a .so file in its directory, loads it dynamically without validation, and imports its attributes into the global namespace. This pattern is standard for extension modules but is risky if the .so file is malicious or tampered with, as it executes native code without any integrity checks. The code itself contains no malicious logic, but its behavior can be exploited in untrusted environments. The lack of validation and trust in external native modules is the primary security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The script is straightforward and does not contain malicious code; however, it poses a significant security risk if the loaded .so file is malicious or compromised. The pattern of loading untrusted native code without validation can lead to arbitrary code execution, making it potentially dangerous in untrusted environments.",
