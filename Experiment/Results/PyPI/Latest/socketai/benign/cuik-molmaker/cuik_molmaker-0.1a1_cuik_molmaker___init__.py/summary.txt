  "conclusion": "The script is straightforward and does not contain malicious code; however, it poses a significant security risk if the loaded .so file is malicious or compromised. The pattern of loading untrusted native code without validation can lead to arbitrary code execution, making it potentially dangerous in untrusted environments."
