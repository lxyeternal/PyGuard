{
  "purpose": "Dynamically loads a compiled shared object (.so) extension module from the current directory.",
  "sources": "The code reads the list of files in the current directory using os.listdir(_module_dir).",
  "sinks": "The code loads a shared object file and executes it using importlib, which could execute malicious code if the .so file is malicious.",
  "flows": "The code identifies a .so file in the directory, loads it with ExtensionFileLoader, executes the module, and imports its attributes into the global namespace.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically loads and executes a shared object file without validation or sandboxing, which can be dangerous if the .so file is malicious or tampered with. No checksums or validation are performed before loading.",
  "analysis": "The code searches for a .so file in its directory and loads it dynamically using importlib's machinery, executing the module with exec_module. It then imports all non-private attributes into the global namespace. This pattern is risky because it executes code from a shared object without verification, potentially allowing malicious code to run if the .so file is compromised. The use of dynamic import and execution without validation presents a security concern, especially if the directory can be influenced by an attacker.",
  "conclusion": "The code dynamically loads a shared object file and executes it without validation, which can be exploited if the file is malicious. This pattern is potentially dangerous, especially in environments where the directory contents can be manipulated. The overall risk is moderate to high depending on context.",
