  "purpose": "Dynamically load a compiled shared object (.so) extension module from the current directory.",
  "sources": "The code reads the list of files in the current directory and inspects their extensions.",
  "sinks": "The code imports and executes a shared object file, then loads its attributes into the global namespace.",
  "flows": "Listing directory -> Finding a .so file -> Loading the module via importlib machinery -> Importing attributes into globals.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic detected. The code dynamically loads an extension without validation or verification of the file contents or origin.",
  "analysis": "The code identifies its directory, searches for a .so file, and loads it as a Python extension module using importlib's machinery. It then imports all non-private attributes into the global namespace. While this method allows flexible extension loading, it can be dangerous if the directory contains untrusted or malicious shared objects, as executing such modules can lead to arbitrary code execution. No malicious code or suspicious behavior is inherently present, but the lack of validation introduces potential risks if the directory contents are compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs dynamic loading of a shared object module without validation, which could be risky if the source is untrusted. However, no explicit malicious behavior or malware signatures are present in the code itself.",
