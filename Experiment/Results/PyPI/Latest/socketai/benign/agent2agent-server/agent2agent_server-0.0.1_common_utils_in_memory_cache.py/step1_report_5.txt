  "purpose": "In-memory thread-safe singleton cache utility for storing and retrieving key-value pairs with optional TTL.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in set() (key, value, ttl), get() (key, default), delete() (key), and clear().",
  "sinks": "Data stored in _cache_data and _ttl dictionaries, accessed or modified via methods; no external sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (keys, values, TTL) flow into set(), data retrieval flows through get(), deletion flows through delete(), and cache clearing through clear().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic behaviors detected. Implementation appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a thread-safe singleton pattern for an in-memory cache with basic set, get, delete, and clear functionalities. Uses locks to prevent race conditions. TTL management is based on current time comparisons. No external data sources or sinks besides method parameters and internal data structures. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious activities observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard in-memory cache utility implementing common patterns without malicious intent or security risks. No signs of malware or malicious behavior identified.",
