  "purpose": "A thread-safe singleton in-memory cache utility for storing, retrieving, and deleting data with optional TTL (time-to-live) expiration.",
  "sources": "Reads data from method parameters (key, value, default, ttl). Accesses current time via time.time().",
  "sinks": "Returns data via get method, modifies internal dictionaries (cache_data, ttl). No data is written to external sources or network.",
  "flows": "set() stores data and optional expiration, get() retrieves data and checks expiration, delete() removes specific data, clear() empties cache.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns. No external data or network operations, and no dynamic code execution. Uses standard thread safety mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton pattern with thread safety, providing in-memory caching with TTL support. Data is stored in internal dictionaries, with expiration checked during get(). All operations are internal and do not involve external sources. No signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior are present. The implementation appears straightforward and secure within its scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard thread-safe in-memory cache utility with TTL, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as intended for cache management without external interactions.",
