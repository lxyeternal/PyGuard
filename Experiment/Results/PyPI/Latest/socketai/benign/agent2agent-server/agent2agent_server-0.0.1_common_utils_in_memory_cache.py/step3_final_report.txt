  "purpose": "A thread-safe singleton in-memory cache with TTL support for storing key-value pairs.",
  "sources": "The set() method accepts key, value, and optional TTL; get() reads data; internal data structures _cache_data and _ttl store data and expiration times.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain external data sinks or network interactions; data is stored internally without external transmission.",
  "flows": "set() writes data to _cache_data and optionally updates _ttl; get() reads from _cache_data and checks _ttl for expiration; delete() removes entries; clear() empties all data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data leaks; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, thread-safe singleton cache with TTL support, using locks to ensure concurrency safety. It does not perform external network calls, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The logic is clear, and the implementation aligns with best practices for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented in-memory cache with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
