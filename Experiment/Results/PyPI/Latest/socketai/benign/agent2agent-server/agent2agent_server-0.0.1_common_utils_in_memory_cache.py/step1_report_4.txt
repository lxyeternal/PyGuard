  "purpose": "A thread-safe singleton in-memory cache utility for storing key-value data with optional TTL.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to methods (set: key, value, ttl; get: key, default; delete: key).",
  "sinks": "Access to internal cache data structures; deletion and clearing of data.",
  "flows": "set method inputs to internal cache storage; get method checks TTL and retrieves data; delete removes specific key; clear wipes all data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. No network, system modification, or data exfiltration observed. Uses standard thread safety mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton pattern for a cache with thread safety, TTL management, and basic CRUD operations. No obfuscated code, external data flows, or suspicious patterns are present. The methods operate solely on internal data structures without external interactions. There are no signs of malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration. The design appears straightforward, intended for in-memory caching.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard thread-safe in-memory cache utility with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior, and the security risk is minimal.",
