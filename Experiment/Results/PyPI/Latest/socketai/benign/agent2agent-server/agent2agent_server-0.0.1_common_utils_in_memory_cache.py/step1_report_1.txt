  "purpose": "Implement a thread-safe singleton in-memory cache with TTL support for storing key-value pairs.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from method parameters (set, get, delete), internal data structures (_cache_data, _ttl).",
  "sinks": "Data stored in _cache_data, retrieved via get, deleted via delete, cleared via clear.",
  "flows": "Input via set or get methods -> stored in _cache_data -> retrieved or deleted, TTL expiry checks during get.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No suspicious network or system calls. The code is a straightforward in-memory cache implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a thread-safe singleton pattern for an in-memory cache with optional TTL support. It manages internal data structures securely with locks. No external network access, no data leaks, no suspicious dynamic code execution. The structure and methods are typical for cache implementations. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard in-memory cache utility with thread safety and TTL features. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious data leaks present. It functions as intended for cache storage without security concerns.",
