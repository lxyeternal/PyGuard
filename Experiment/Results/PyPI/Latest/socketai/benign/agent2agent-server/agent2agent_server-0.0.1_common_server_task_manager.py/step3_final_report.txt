  "purpose": "In-memory task management system with push notifications and SSE support.",
  "sources": "Request parameters for task IDs, push notification configs, and event streams.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures storing tasks, notifications, and SSE subscriber queues; no external data leaks or network calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from request parameters into internal dictionaries; task updates and notifications are managed via async methods and queues.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Unlimited asyncio.Queue (maxsize=0) could pose resource exhaustion risk but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard asyncio primitives for concurrency, manages tasks and notifications in-memory, and provides methods for setting/getting notifications and handling SSE subscriptions. No external network activity or malicious patterns are present. The unlimited queue size is a potential operational concern but not malicious. The code is clear, maintainable, and follows best practices for async Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard in-memory task management component with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The minor resource concern does not elevate the security risk to malicious levels.",
