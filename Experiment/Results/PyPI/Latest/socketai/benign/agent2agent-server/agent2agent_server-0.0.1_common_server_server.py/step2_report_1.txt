  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the server's function and data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate depiction of response mechanisms and flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activities, secrets, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Fair assessment; the code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the server's role.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly describes data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Consistent with code behavior; no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Well-aligned with the code's transparency.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly describes the server's operation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns; scores align with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly described.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Consistent with the code's straightforward design.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** Uniformly 0.2, reflecting low security risk—appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0 across all reports; no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remain at 0; code is transparent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is reasonable; unless external dependencies or runtime behavior suggest otherwise, no change needed.\n\n**Additional note:** The code relies heavily on external modules (`common.types`, `common.server.task_manager`, `uvicorn`, etc.). The security posture depends on these dependencies' integrity. If any of these are compromised, the overall risk could increase, but based solely on this code, no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Your estimated scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **Risk:** 0.2\n\n- **Reasoning:** The code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses standard libraries. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are present.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Continue monitoring dependencies and runtime behavior for comprehensive supply chain security.",
