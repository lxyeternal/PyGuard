{
  "purpose": "A server handling JSON-RPC requests related to task management and agent info, using Starlette framework.",
  "sources": "Reads request body via await request.json(), incoming HTTP requests, imported modules, environment variables indirectly via uvicorn.run().",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe response generation via JSONResponse and EventSourceResponse, logging outputs, exception handling converting exceptions to JSON responses.",
  "flows": "Request body -> validation with A2ARequest.validate_python -> task manager methods -> response creation. Exceptions flow to error handler -> JSON error response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; standard exception handling; no unusual dynamic code execution; use of imported libraries appears normal. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as an API server, validating incoming JSON requests against predefined models, then delegating tasks to a task manager, and returning responses. Exception handling converts parsing or validation errors into JSON error responses, with logging of unexpected issues. No suspicious code paths, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity are present. The use of standard libraries and the server setup appears legitimate, with proper input validation and error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical API server implementation for task processing with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It correctly handles errors and uses established libraries without suspicious modifications or obfuscation.",
