  "purpose": "A server handling JSON-RPC requests for task management, validating requests, dispatching to task_manager methods, and providing agent info.",
  "sources": "Request body JSON data, imported modules (common.types, task_manager, agent_card).",
  "sinks": "Response generation via JSONResponse or EventSourceResponse, task_manager method calls.",
  "flows": "Request JSON -> validation -> method dispatch -> result -> response.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured server implementation using standard libraries. It performs validation, error handling, and response formatting appropriately. No signs of obfuscation, malicious network activity, or secret leaks are present. External dependencies are not provided, so their trustworthiness cannot be assessed, but the code itself is benign. Exception handling is broad but safe. The response types and flow are standard for such a server.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, secure, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified given the code's nature and external dependencies. Malware score is 0, and obfuscation score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
