{
  "purpose": "Implements push notification authentication using JWTs, RSA key management, URL validation, and payload hashing to ensure secure communication and prevent replay attacks.",
  "sources": "Request headers for authorization tokens, request body for payload hashing, external URL for URL validation, key generation functions.",
  "sinks": "JWT signing and verification processes, HTTP requests to external URLs, response handling for key distribution.",
  "flows": "Payload data is hashed and included in JWTs; JWTs are signed with private keys; verification involves decoding JWTs and matching payload hashes; URL validation uses UUID challenge-response; external HTTP calls for URL validation and key fetching.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; URL validation relies on UUID challenge-response, which is standard; external dependencies are used appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard cryptographic practices with RSA keys, signing payload hashes and timestamps to prevent replay attacks. URL validation via UUID challenge-response is typical. External HTTP calls are handled with proper exception handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The code is clear, well-structured, and follows best practices for push notification security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation of push notification authentication using JWTs, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low risk score of 0.2 is justified, and the malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero.",
