  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided, but it appears to be a Python script that may handle data processing or network communication based on the structure.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from environment variables, potentially from network sockets or files (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential data output to network connections, files, or environment variables; possible use of eval() or exec() functions if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input functions through processing functions, potentially leading to network transmission or file writing.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials or URLs, use of eval()/exec(), obfuscated or confusing variable names, unnecessary dynamic execution, or hidden code segments.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review of the code reveals areas where untrusted input may be processed. No explicit use of insecure functions like eval() or exec() was identified; however, suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets or unusual imports were not detected. The code structure appears straightforward, with no obfuscated segments or malicious obfuscation techniques. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard and unrelated to malicious intent. The code does not contain any network connections to suspicious domains or actions that would suggest malicious activity. Overall, the code appears benign but lacks complete context for definitive certainty.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The code seems to serve a legitimate purpose, with no suspicious or harmful actions detected. However, without more context, a low confidence level is maintained.",
