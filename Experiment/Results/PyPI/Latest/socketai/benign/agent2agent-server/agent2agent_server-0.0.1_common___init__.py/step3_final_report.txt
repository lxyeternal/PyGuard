  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, data handling functions, dynamic execution points, network connections, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables flow into dynamic execution or network functions, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of eval/exec, cryptic structure, dynamic code constructs, potential concealment tactics.",
  "analysis": "The code shows varying levels of obfuscation and dynamic execution. Reports 1, 2, 4, and 5 indicate benign, straightforward code with no malicious indicators, assigning low malware and risk scores. Report 3 exhibits significant obfuscation (score 0.7) and dynamic execution, raising suspicion. The malware score of 0.4 in Report 3 is justified but could be slightly increased to 0.6 to better reflect the obfuscation level. Overall, the scores are consistent with the evidence, with no confirmed malicious activity, but some suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic code in Report 3.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are generally accurate; Report 3's obfuscation warrants a higher malware score (0.6). Other reports correctly show low risk and malware scores. No confirmed malicious activity is present; scores reflect suspicion levels appropriately.",
