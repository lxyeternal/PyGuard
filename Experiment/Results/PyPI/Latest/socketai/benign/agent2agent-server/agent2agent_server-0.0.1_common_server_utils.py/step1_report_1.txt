{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for checking modality compatibility and generating standardized error responses in a JSON-RPC context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters such as 'server_output_modes', 'client_output_modes', and 'request_id'.",
  "sinks": "The functions generate JSONRPCResponse objects which may be sent over the network, potentially exposing request IDs or error information.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are checked for validity and used to determine modality compatibility; request IDs are used to generate error responses that are returned to the caller.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The functions are straightforward and standard for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions to evaluate modality compatibility and to generate error responses with request IDs. It performs simple input validation, such as checking for None or empty lists, and creates response objects accordingly. There is no data leakage, insecure data handling, or suspicious behavior. The functions rely on imported classes and error types, which are standard. No malicious code, obfuscation, or malware-like behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for error handling in a JSON-RPC server context. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as expected for legitimate application logic.",
