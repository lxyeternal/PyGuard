  "purpose": "Utility functions for checking modality compatibility and creating error responses in a JSON-RPC context.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'server_output_modes', 'client_output_modes', and 'request_id' variables.",
  "sinks": "Return statements creating 'JSONRPCResponse' objects with error types; no untrusted data is processed into vulnerable sinks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used directly to generate response objects; no flow from untrusted sources to insecure sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The functions perform straightforward validation and response creation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions that handle modality compatibility checks and error response creation. The 'are_modalities_compatible' function checks for non-empty modality lists and common elements, which is standard. The error functions generate response objects with specific error types, using provided request IDs. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code uses only trusted library components and standard programming constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for error handling and validation in a JSON-RPC framework. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present. The overall security risk is minimal.",
