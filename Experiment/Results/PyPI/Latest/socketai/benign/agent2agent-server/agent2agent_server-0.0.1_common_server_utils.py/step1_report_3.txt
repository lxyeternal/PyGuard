{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling modality compatibility checks and generating JSONRPC error responses related to content type support and unsupported operations.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read input data directly from external sources; they rely on parameters passed into functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions create and return JSONRPCResponse objects, which could potentially send data back to clients or calling systems.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (server_output_modes, client_output_modes, request_id) are used to determine modality compatibility or generate specific error responses; these are packaged into JSONRPCResponse objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious variable names, or unusual code constructs. The logic is straightforward and typical for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports types and defines functions for compatibility checks and error creation. Compatibility logic checks if modality lists are empty or None, and if not, whether they share common elements. Error functions generate standardized response objects with specific error types. No untrusted input handling, code injection, or suspicious behavior observed. No obfuscated or malicious patterns present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for managing modality compatibility and error responses in a JSONRPC context. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
