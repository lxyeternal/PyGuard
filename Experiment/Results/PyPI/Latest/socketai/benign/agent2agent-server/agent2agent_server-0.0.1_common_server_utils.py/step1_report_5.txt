{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for checking modality compatibility and generating specific JSON-RPC error responses related to content type support and unimplemented operations.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or data from external or untrusted sources; functions are invoked with parameters, and data is passed through function arguments.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes untrusted data to external systems, files, or network; it constructs and returns JSONRPCResponse objects internally.",
  "flows": "No external input is processed in a way that affects system security; the functions process given parameters and return structured responses.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for compatibility checks and error message creation in a JSON-RPC context. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or data leakage points. It relies on imported modules for response objects and errors but does not perform any unsafe operations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for JSON-RPC error handling and compatibility checks, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
