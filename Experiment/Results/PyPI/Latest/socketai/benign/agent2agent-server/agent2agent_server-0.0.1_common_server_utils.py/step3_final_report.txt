  "purpose": "Utility functions for checking modality compatibility and generating JSON-RPC error responses.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: server_output_modes, client_output_modes, request_id.",
  "sinks": "Generated JSONRPCResponse objects with error types; no data leaks or external calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> validation checks -> response creation with error objects.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard validation and response generation, no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple validation of modality lists and creates error responses for unsupported types or operations. It relies on imported classes and error types, which are assumed to be standard. No untrusted data processing beyond parameters occurs, and no network or file operations are present. The logic is straightforward, with proper handling of None or empty lists. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The functions serve as utility components within a JSON-RPC framework, with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and secure. It contains no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (around 0.1) for the first report due to high confidence, but overall negligible risk. No modifications are necessary.",
