  "purpose": "The code defines utility functions for checking modality compatibility and generating error responses for a JSON-RPC server.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (server_output_modes, client_output_modes, request_id)",
  "sinks": "Return statements generating JSONRPCResponse objects and error instances",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to determine compatibility or generate error responses",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious data handling, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code, no external network calls",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward logical checks for modality compatibility and generates standardized JSON-RPC error responses. It imports types from a common module but does not include any malicious or suspicious operations. The functions are simple and do not process untrusted input beyond their parameters. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. The logic is clear and typical for error handling in JSON-RPC protocols.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard validation and error response generation, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
