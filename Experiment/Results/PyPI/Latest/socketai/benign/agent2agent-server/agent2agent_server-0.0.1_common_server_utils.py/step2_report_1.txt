  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Logic**:\n   - The functions `are_modalities_compatible`, `new_incompatible_types_error`, and `new_not_implemented_error` are straightforward utility functions.\n   - They perform basic input validation, compatibility checks, and generate standardized JSON-RPC response objects with specific error types.\n   - The code relies on imported classes and error types, which are assumed to be standard and trusted.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation**:\n   - All reports agree that there are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n   - The functions do not process untrusted input beyond their parameters, nor do they perform any network or file operations.\n   - The logic is simple, clear, and typical for error handling in a JSON-RPC context.\n\n3. **Potential Security Risks**:\n   - The only minor concern could be the exposure of request IDs or error details via the generated responses, but this is standard practice and not inherently risky.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are consistently low or zero across reports, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Scores Justification**:\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is justified given the code's benign purpose.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), reflecting the clear understanding of the code's behavior.\n\n5. **Any Inconsistencies or Unreasonable Scores?**\n   - No. The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is purely utility functions for error handling and compatibility checks, and all reports agree on their benign nature, the overall risk remains minimal.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified here.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 (very low, mostly standard validation and error handling)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe code is a standard, benign utility module with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is safe, straightforward, and correctly scored.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n- The overall security posture of this code is very high, with negligible risk.",
