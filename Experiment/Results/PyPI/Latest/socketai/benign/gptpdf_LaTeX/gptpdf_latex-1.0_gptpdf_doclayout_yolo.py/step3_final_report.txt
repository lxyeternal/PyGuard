{
  "purpose": "Detects figures and pictures in an image, annotates, and generates LaTeX code for detected figures.",
  "sources": "Model weights downloaded from Hugging Face, image file read via PIL, input image path provided by user.",
  "sinks": "Annotated image saved to output path, LaTeX code printed for detected figures.",
  "flows": "Model weights downloaded from external repository → model initialized → image processed for detection → detection results used to generate LaTeX code and optionally save annotated image.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. External dependency on Hugging Face is standard but introduces a supply chain dependency.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard figure detection using a pre-trained YOLO model, downloading weights from a reputable source. It processes images, detects figures, and generates LaTeX snippets. No malicious commands, network activity beyond model download, or obfuscated code are present. The external dependency is typical for ML workflows and does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are justified given the code's behavior and external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious figure detection utility with no signs of sabotage or malware. External dependencies are standard but should be acknowledged as potential supply chain risks. Overall, the security posture is low risk, and the scores are appropriate.",
