{
  "purpose": "The code detects figures in an image using a YOLO model, annotates, saves, and generates LaTeX code for the detected figures.",
  "sources": "Reads input image from a file path; downloads model weights from Hugging Face Hub; uses torch.cuda.is_available() for device detection.",
  "sinks": "Uses the downloaded model weights in memory; outputs LaTeX code to console; saves annotated image to a specified path.",
  "flows": "Source: image path and model weights download -> Model prediction -> Extraction of bounding boxes -> LaTeX code generation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network connections; no obfuscated code; standard use of libraries and straightforward flow; no suspicious data leaks or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs legitimate image processing and model inference using standard libraries and APIs. It downloads model weights from a reputable source (Hugging Face), with no evidence of malicious payloads or unusual network activity. It processes image data securely, and the output is solely LaTeX code and saved images. There are no hidden backdoors, malicious commands, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code’s behavior is consistent with intended functionality, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for figure detection in images, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It uses external libraries and models responsibly without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
