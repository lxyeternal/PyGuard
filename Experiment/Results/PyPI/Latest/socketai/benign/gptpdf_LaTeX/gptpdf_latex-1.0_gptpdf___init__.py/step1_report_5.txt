  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "This code is a simple import statement, importing 'parse_pdf' from a local module. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no outputs or network activity. Without additional context, it appears to be a standard import used in modular Python code. Since no data handling, network, or security-sensitive operations are present, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic import statement with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It is standard Python module import syntax, and no suspicious activity is observed.",
