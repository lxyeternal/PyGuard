  "purpose": "Import the parse_pdf function from the local parse module, likely for processing PDF files.",
  "sources": "The code imports a function from a local module; no external input or data reading occurs here.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable in this single line of code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual language features, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a simple relative import statement for a function named parse_pdf. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns. As it stands, this line alone does not indicate malicious intent. It is a typical import statement used in Python projects. Without additional context or code, it is not possible to assess broader risks, but based solely on this snippet, there are no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement importing parse_pdf from a local module. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
