  "purpose": "Import a function named parse_pdf from a local module parse.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external input or data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows; the code only performs a static import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of parse_pdf from a local module parse. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, hardcoded secrets, or data processing. The reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Given the simplicity and clarity of the code, there is no evidence to suggest any malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No further action or concern is necessary.",
