  "purpose": "Import the parse_pdf function from the local parse module, likely for PDF parsing functionality.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the parse function from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible with this single import statement alone.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports a function from a local module. No external data is read, and no untrusted input is processed here. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity in this single line. Without additional context, this appears to be standard import syntax for modular code structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard import operation with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
