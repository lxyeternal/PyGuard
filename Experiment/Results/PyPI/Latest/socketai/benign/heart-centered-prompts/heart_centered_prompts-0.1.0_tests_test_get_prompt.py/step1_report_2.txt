  "purpose": "Unit tests for the get_prompt function in the heart_centered_prompts module, verifying prompt retrieval and error handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters passed to get_prompt (detail_level, collection), potentially including invalid values.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data into external systems or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → get_prompt → validation checks or prompt generation; no external data flow or malicious code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. Use of cast for type handling is benign here.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of unit tests using pytest to validate the behavior of get_prompt. It tests default behavior, different detail levels, and error conditions for invalid inputs. No external data sources, network calls, or malicious behavior are present. The code is structured as expected for tests and does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of standard unit tests with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It properly tests input validation and output expectations. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
