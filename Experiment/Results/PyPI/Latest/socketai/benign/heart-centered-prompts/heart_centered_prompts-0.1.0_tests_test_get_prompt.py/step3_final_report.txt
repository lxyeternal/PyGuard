{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the get_prompt function, verifying default prompt retrieval, prompt variations by detail level, and error handling for invalid inputs.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters for get_prompt (detail_level, collection) and internal function calls within get_prompt.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or system effects; the code only performs assertions and exception checks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (detail_level, collection) flow into get_prompt, which returns prompts; the tests verify prompt length and exception raising.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. Use of cast(Any, ...) is standard for testing invalid inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, well-structured unit tests with no external data handling, network calls, or malicious behavior. It tests input validation and output length based on parameters. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or covert operations are detected. The use of cast for invalid inputs is typical in testing scenarios. The assertions and exception checks are appropriate and do not introduce vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
