{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the get_prompt function in the heart_centered_prompts module to verify different prompt retrieval scenarios and error handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (typing, pytest), and calls to get_prompt with various parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process or output untrusted data in a way that leads to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (detail_level, collection) are passed to get_prompt; return values are checked but not used to influence external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The test functions are standard, straightforward, and do not perform unsafe operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing using pytest, calling get_prompt with valid and invalid parameters, and asserting expected behavior. No malicious or suspicious operations are present. There are no network operations, data exfiltration, or code injection mechanisms. The test code is well-structured and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for testing the get_prompt function, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any harmful behaviors or suspicious patterns.",
