  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - All reports consistently state that the code is a standard test suite for the `get_prompt` function.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n   - The code does not read external data, perform network operations, or write to external systems.\n   - The use of `cast(Any, ...)` is typical in testing to simulate invalid inputs and does not indicate malicious intent.\n   - There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated segments, or covert behaviors.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The test code appears correct and well-structured.\n   - The assertions about prompt length per detail level seem reasonable.\n   - The exception tests correctly verify that invalid parameters raise `ValueError`.\n   - No logical flaws or errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - **Confidence scores:** All are 1, indicating high confidence in the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Supply Chain Concerns:**\n   - The code is purely for testing; it does not execute untrusted code or handle sensitive data.\n   - No external dependencies are exploited or misused.\n   - The function `get_prompt` is tested with both valid and invalid inputs, ensuring robustness but not indicating malicious activity.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\nGiven the detailed analysis and the consistent expert assessments, the code poses no security threat, contains no malicious payloads, and is a standard testing suite. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the detailed reasoning above.",
