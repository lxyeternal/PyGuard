  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - The code is a standard set of unit tests for the `get_prompt` function.\n   - No external data sources, network calls, or file operations are involved.\n   - The tests only verify prompt length and error handling.\n   - No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The reports consistently confirm the benign nature of the code, with confidence scores of 1 and no anomalies.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying the code as benign.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The assessment of the code's security posture is accurate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No need to adjust these scores.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since all evidence points to a benign, well-structured test suite with no malicious activity, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - Any higher score would be unjustified and inconsistent with the evidence.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This aligns with the analysis; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n6. **Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The tests do not make unsafe assumptions or execute untrusted code.\n   - They only test the behavior of a known function with controlled inputs.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Estimated Scores (my conclusion):**\n\nGiven the thorough review and consistent findings, I concur with the existing scores. The code is a standard, safe test suite with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Final note:** There are no indications of supply chain risks, malicious payloads, or obfuscation in this code. It is a benign, well-structured test suite.",
