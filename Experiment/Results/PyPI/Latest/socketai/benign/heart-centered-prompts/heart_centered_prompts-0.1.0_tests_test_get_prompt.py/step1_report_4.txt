{
  "purpose": "The code contains test cases for the get_prompt function in the heart_centered_prompts module, validating different prompt retrieval scenarios and error handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters (detail_level, collection) and external modules (pytest, get_prompt, cast).",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit untrusted data or perform any I/O operations that could leak data; it only asserts conditions within tests.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed to get_prompt; the function's behavior depends on these inputs; no external or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The test functions are straightforward and use standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple test functions to validate get_prompt's output and error handling, with no evidence of code execution that could lead to malicious activity. It uses standard testing constructs, including assertions and exception checks. No external data is fetched, nor is there any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code is purely for testing purposes, with no apparent security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of standard test cases for the get_prompt function, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It solely verifies the function's behavior and error handling in a controlled environment.",
