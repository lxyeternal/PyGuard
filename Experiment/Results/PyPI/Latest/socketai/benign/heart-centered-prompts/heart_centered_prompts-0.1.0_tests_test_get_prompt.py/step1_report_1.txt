{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test the behavior of the get_prompt function from the heart_centered_prompts module, verifying prompt retrieval and error handling for invalid inputs.",
  "sources": "User input is simulated via function parameters; no external data sources are explicitly read; the code does not read from files, network, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data output, network communication, or system modification are present; the code only asserts conditions based on function outputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed to get_prompt, which then returns prompts; the test functions check the returned prompts for expected properties without passing untrusted data into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures are present. The code follows standard testing practices with no hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing modules and the target function, then defines several test cases for valid and invalid inputs. It verifies prompt length based on detail levels and expects exceptions for invalid parameters. There is no evidence of data leaks, malicious data handling, or covert operations. The code's structure is typical for unit tests and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard test suite for a prompt-generation function, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions solely to validate expected behavior and error handling without any suspicious or harmful code elements.",
