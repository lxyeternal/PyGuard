  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step.\n\n**1. Confirm if issues are present in the code:**\n- The code is a set of standard unit tests for `get_prompt`.\n- It tests default behavior, various detail levels, and invalid inputs.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or data leaks are involved.\n- The code appears clean, straightforward, and follows best practices for testing.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**\n- The reports consistently state there are no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- They correctly identify that the code is purely for testing and does not perform any harmful operations.\n- The use of `cast(Any, ...)` is a standard testing approach to simulate invalid inputs, not malicious behavior.\n- No logical flaws or misleading claims are evident.\n\n**3. Scores given to each issue:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These scores are reasonable given the evidence.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- Since all reports agree there's no malware, obfuscation, or security risk, scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- No evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or covert operations.\n\n**5. Malware score analysis:**\n- The code does not contain any malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The reports correctly reflect a malware score of 0.\n\n**6. Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities:**\n- The tests do not introduce or assume any vulnerabilities.\n- They only validate input handling and output length.\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made without evidence.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report:**\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- The scores accurately reflect the absence of malicious or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign test suite with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The tests are straightforward, validating expected behavior and error handling. There are no signs of supply chain risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the review, the code and reports show no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and I concur with the assessments provided.",
