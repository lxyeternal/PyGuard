  "purpose": "Unit tests for the get_prompt function in the heart_centered_prompts module, verifying correct behavior and error handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to get_prompt: 'detail_level' and 'collection' (via function calls in tests).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; test code only invokes get_prompt with controlled values.",
  "flows": "Controlled test inputs flow through get_prompt; no untrusted data sources or external communication present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of cast with 'Any' to forcibly pass invalid inputs; standard practice in testing, no malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of unit tests verifying the behavior of get_prompt with various inputs. It employs pytest for assertions and exception handling. The use of cast and 'Any' is typical in testing to simulate invalid inputs. No code injection, external data leaks, or malicious patterns are detected. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present. The code is well-structured, focused solely on testing input validation and output lengths.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of benign unit tests with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard validation and error handling for the get_prompt function, with no indication of malware or supply chain threats.",
