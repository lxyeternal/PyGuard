{
  "purpose": "A Python package designed to facilitate integration with heart-centered AI system prompts.",
  "sources": "The code imports get_prompt from a relative module .api, which may involve external data or logic, but no input reading is directly visible.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points are present in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or output occurs here.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows, input-output, or untrusted data pathways in this minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of module-level documentation, a single import statement, and module metadata variables. It does not perform any data processing, external calls, or contain any potentially malicious code. The import could reference a potentially external or complex module, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation, secret handling, or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple package skeleton with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign module setup for an AI prompt package.",
