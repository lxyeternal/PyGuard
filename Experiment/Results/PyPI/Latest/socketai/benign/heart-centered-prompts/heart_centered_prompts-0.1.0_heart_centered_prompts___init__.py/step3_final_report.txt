  "purpose": "Minimal package initialization module importing a function from a local module and defining metadata.",
  "sources": "Import from .api module, setting __version__, __all__",
  "sinks": "None; no data or untrusted input handling present",
  "flows": "Import from local module, no external data flow or network activity",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code, no obfuscation or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple __init__.py style module with no data processing, network calls, or input handling. It imports a function from a local module, sets version info, and defines export list. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets are present. All reports correctly assign malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0, consistent with the benign and minimal nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal package initialization file with no signs of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No further action or concern is necessary based on this snippet.",
