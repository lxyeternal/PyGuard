  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the findings against the provided code snippet.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal Python package, likely an `__init__.py`, that:\n  - Imports `get_prompt` from a local module `.api`.\n  - Defines `__version__` and `__all__`.\n- The code is straightforward, with no input handling, external network calls, or data processing visible.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets are present.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no data leaks, no anomalies.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign and minimal.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; no suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious intent detected.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious code, straightforward.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Findings:** No data flow, no input/output handling, standard structure.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No risks identified.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Findings:** No external data processing, no obfuscation, simple import and metadata.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple, benign package initialization.\n- The consistent malware score of 0 across all reports aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the minimal, non-privileged code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** The current scores are appropriate and reasonable.\n- **Potential Risks:** Since the code only imports a function from a local module, the actual behavior and security implications depend on the implementation of `.api`. However, based solely on this snippet, no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Assumptions:** No assumptions about the external `.api` module are warranted here; the report correctly refrains from speculating.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward package setup with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code appears benign, and the security posture is safe based on this snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always review the implementation of the imported `.api` module to ensure it doesn't introduce risks, but based on this code alone, there is no concern.",
