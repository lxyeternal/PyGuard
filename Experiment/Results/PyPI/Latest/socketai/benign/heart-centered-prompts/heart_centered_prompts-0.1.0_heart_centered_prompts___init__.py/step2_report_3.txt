  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is minimal, straightforward, and lacks any suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- The code is a typical `__init__.py` style module, importing a function from a local `.api` module, defining version info, and an export list.\n- No external data handling, network communication, or input processing is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The import source `.api` is local, and without seeing its contents, we cannot determine if it contains malicious code, but the reports do not suggest any issues there.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is consistent with a standard package initialization pattern. No issues or malicious behavior are evident.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, malicious intent, or suspicious code.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None identified.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws are present in this minimal code snippet.\n- The reports correctly note that the code does not process untrusted data or perform external operations.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the absence of any malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since there are no security risks evident.\n\n### Potential issues with scores:\n- No adjustments needed; scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the evidence, I concur with the reports' conclusions that this code is benign and poses no security threat.\n\n**However,** considering the overall context:\n- The actual security concern might reside in the `.api` module, which is not provided here.\n- Since the reports focus solely on this snippet, and all agree on its benign nature, I see no reason to elevate any scores.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final note:** Without additional context or code from the `.api` module, there is no basis to suspect malicious activity in this snippet.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign, standard package initialization file.\n- All scores are appropriate and should remain at 0.\n- No further action is necessary based on the provided information.",
