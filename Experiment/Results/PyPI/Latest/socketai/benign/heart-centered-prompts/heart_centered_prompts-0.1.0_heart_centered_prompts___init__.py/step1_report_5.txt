{
  "purpose": "This package provides an interface to an API for heart-centered AI prompts, primarily for integrating prompt retrieval functionality.",
  "sources": "The code imports get_prompt from a local api module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data processing, output, or untrusted data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines metadata (__version__, __all__) and imports a function get_prompt from a local module. It does not process input data or execute external commands. No obfuscation or hidden logic is present. The presence of a local import suggests that actual functionality resides in the api module, but this file itself contains no malicious code or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign package initialization file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply exposes an API function for use elsewhere.",
