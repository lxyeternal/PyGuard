  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the evidence for malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a minimal, straightforward package initialization module.\n- The code only imports a function from a local module `.api`, sets version info, and defines `__all__`.\n- No input handling, network calls, data processing, or external data are present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- The reports uniformly assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. The code is a simple module with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate based on the provided code snippet.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n  \n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and not obfuscated.\n  \n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- The only minor point is that the import from `.api` could, in theory, involve complex or external logic, but since this code only imports and exposes a function, there's no evidence of malicious intent or security risk.\n- Without access to the `.api` module, we cannot fully assess the overall package behavior, but based solely on this snippet, there's no indication of issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is a minimal, benign package setup with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. Given the evidence, I agree with the assigned scores. No further action or suspicion is warranted based on this code snippet alone.",
