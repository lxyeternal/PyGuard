  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code's behavior:**\n- The script is a standard Python setup script that copies prompt files (*.txt) from a local 'prompts' directory in the project root into the package directory during installation, development, or egg_info commands.\n- It uses custom setuptools commands to perform the copying.\n- The copying process involves creating directories and copying static files; no dynamic code execution, user input, or external network activity is involved.\n- All operations are filesystem manipulations, with no signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Reports:\n- **Presence of malicious activity or malware:** None. All reports agree that the script performs benign static file copying.\n- **Obfuscation or hidden behaviors:** No evidence of obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None apparent; the code is straightforward and standard for package setup.\n\n### Evaluation of the scores:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0. This is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1 in report 2). Given the analysis, a score of 0 seems justified.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or questionable claims are present in the reports.\n- The reports correctly identify that the script only performs static filesystem operations.\n- The reasoning is consistent across all reports.\n\n### Potential issues or points of concern:\n- **No external network activity or dynamic code execution:** Confirmed.\n- **No handling of untrusted input or user data:** Confirmed.\n- **No obfuscation or hidden behaviors:** Confirmed.\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the detailed review, **there are no security issues, malware, or suspicious behaviors in this code**. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.0** — no security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard setup script for packaging static prompt files, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe setup script is a typical package configuration that copies static files during installation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No changes to scores are necessary.",
