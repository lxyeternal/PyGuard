{
  "purpose": "This setup script prepares and installs the 'heart_centered_prompts' package, copying prompt files into the package during build or development.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description; copying prompt files from project root prompts directory; executing custom install, develop, and egg_info commands.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; file copying is from local directories; no external network or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Reading static README.md -> copying prompt files from project directory to package -> executing custom commands during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of custom commands to copy prompt files; no input validation or user input handling; file copying from local directories is standard, no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a local README.md file for documentation, then defines functions to copy prompt files from the project root prompts directory into the package structure during installation or development. Custom classes override standard setuptools commands to perform these copying actions. The copying process includes directory creation and file transfer, which are straightforward filesystem operations. No external network access, no evaluation of untrusted input, nor malicious code patterns are present. No code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected. The code appears to be a standard setup utility with custom file copying logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script primarily for copying static prompt files into the package during installation or development. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The code performs expected filesystem operations without external dependencies or suspicious activities.",
