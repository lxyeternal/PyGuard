  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and installing the 'heart_centered_prompts' project, including copying prompt files during build/install.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; accesses filesystem to copy prompt files from project root to package directories.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processed or used in a manner that leads to security risks.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials or backdoors, no network activity, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks for a Python package, including reading a README file and copying prompt files from the project root to the package directory during install, develop, or egg_info commands. The copying process is straightforward, involving directory creation and file copying, with checks to ensure source directories exist. There are no indications of malicious intent, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All operations are local filesystem manipulations typical for package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It responsibly manages copying prompt files during package build/install without any security concerns.",
