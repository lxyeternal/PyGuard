{
  "purpose": "The script is for setting up the Python package 'heart_centered_prompts', managing package installation, development setup, and copying prompt files into the package.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; reads prompt files from the 'prompts' directory in the project root; uses setuptools' setup and command classes.",
  "sinks": "Copies prompt files to package directories during installation or development; no untrusted input processing or external data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Reads prompt files from project directory -> copies to package directory during install/develop/egg_info commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; the copying process is straightforward. No unusual or obfuscated code is present. The setup process is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code manages package setup, including copying prompt files from a local 'prompts' directory into the package at build time. It does not execute external or untrusted code, nor does it handle user input or external data sources. The functions are standard for packaging and do not exhibit malicious behavior. The copying logic is safe and intended for packaging assets. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malware-like activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It only manages local file copying for packaging purposes.",
