{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that copies prompt text files from a local 'prompts' directory into the package during installation, development, or egg_info commands.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads from the 'prompts' directory in the project root, directory creation, and file copying operations.",
  "sinks": "Copying prompt files into the package directory; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "Source: reading prompt files from 'prompts' directory; sink: copying files into package structure during setup commands.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors; straightforward static file copying.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard filesystem operations to include static prompt files into the package. It reads files from a trusted local directory and copies them into the package directory during setup phases. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input is present. The code is clear, uses standard practices, and contains no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup utility for packaging static prompt files, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. The scores are accurate and should remain as is.",
