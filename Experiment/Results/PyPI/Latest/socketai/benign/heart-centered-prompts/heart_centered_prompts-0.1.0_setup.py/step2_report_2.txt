  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its purpose, and the security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a setup script for a Python package that copies static prompt files from the project root into the package during installation or development.\n- All reports agree that the script performs filesystem operations (directory creation, copying files) from known, local directories.\n- No network activity, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input is present.\n- The code is straightforward, using standard setuptools mechanisms with custom commands to copy files.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue Presence & Logic Review**\n\n**Are the reported issues present?**  \nYes. All reports correctly identify that the script copies prompt files from a local 'prompts' directory into the package structure during setup. No issues are found in the actual code logic.\n\n---\n\n### **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign, filesystem-based setup operations.\n- No false positives or overlooked malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The reports do not overstate security risks or ignore potential concerns; they correctly conclude that the script is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Scores and Justifications**\n\n**Malware Score:**  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. The script only copies static files; no malicious activity is detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \nAll reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \nMost reports assign 0 or 0.1. Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0.1 might be slightly conservative but acceptable, considering the file copying from local directories during setup. There's no indication of security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes. The scores align with the analysis—no malicious or obfuscated activity, and minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions. They all base their conclusions on observable filesystem operations and standard setup procedures.\n\n---\n\n### **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Security Considerations**\n\n- The script depends on the local 'prompts' directory existing and containing trusted files.\n- If an attacker could modify the 'prompts' directory, they could inject malicious prompt files, but this is a supply chain concern outside the scope of the script itself.\n- The script does not execute or evaluate prompt files; it merely copies them, so the risk is limited to the integrity of source files.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment & Recommendations**\n\n**Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal risk associated with copying files from a local directory, assuming source integrity.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard setup script for packaging static prompt files, with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The existing scores are appropriate, and no further adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that the source 'prompts' directory is secured and trusted, as the script will copy its contents into the package. However, this is a packaging concern rather than a code security issue.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, and the scores reflect its safety profile appropriately.",
