  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the script is a straightforward setup utility that copies static prompt files from the project directory into the package during build, install, or development setup.\n- No external network activity, dynamic code execution, or user input handling is present.\n- The code is standard, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- The purpose is benign: organizing static files for packaging.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Malware score: 0**\n- **Obfuscated: 0**\n- **Security risk: 0**\n- **Confidence: 1.0**\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity or obfuscation. The logic is simple and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Malware score: 0**\n- **Obfuscated: 0**\n- **Security risk: 0.1**\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) seems unwarranted. The code does not perform any risky operations; it's just copying local files. The minimal risk could be justified if considering the potential for malicious prompt files, but the code itself is safe. I would suggest lowering this to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Malware score: 0**\n- **Obfuscated: 0**\n- **Security risk: 0**\n- **Confidence: 1**\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's nature. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Malware score: 0**\n- **Obfuscated: 0**\n- **Security risk: 0**\n- **Confidence: 1**\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Malware score: 0**\n- **Obfuscated: 0**\n- **Security risk: 0**\n- **Confidence: 1**\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The script is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk:** Slight overestimation in report 2 (0.1). Given the code's simplicity and local filesystem operations, this should be 0.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across the board.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across the board.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent.\n- The copying of static files during setup is standard practice.\n- No assumptions about malicious prompt content are justified solely based on this code.\n\n**In conclusion, I agree with the reports' assessments that the code is benign, with the minor exception of adjusting the security risk score in report 2 to 0.**",
