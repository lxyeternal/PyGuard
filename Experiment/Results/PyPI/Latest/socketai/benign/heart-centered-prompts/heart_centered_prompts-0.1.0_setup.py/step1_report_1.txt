{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'heart_centered_prompts', copying prompt files from the project root into the package during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description; copies prompt files from the project's 'prompts' directory; utilizes package setup functions and custom commands for copying files.",
  "sinks": "File copying operations from source prompts directory to package directory; no network or data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "The prompts directory is copied from project root to package directory during install, develop, or egg_info commands, involving reading from the filesystem and writing to package directory.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as code injection, backdoors, or unusual runtime behaviors. The script focuses solely on copying static files and package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and uses setuptools for package setup. It reads a README file to include as long description. Custom commands are defined for copying prompts from a 'prompts' directory in project root into the package structure during installation phases. The copy_prompts function safely creates directories and copies '*.txt' files; no untrusted input handling or external network calls. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present. The purpose appears benign, focusing on packaging and static file management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for packaging prompts in a Python project. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The script functions solely to organize prompt files for distribution.",
