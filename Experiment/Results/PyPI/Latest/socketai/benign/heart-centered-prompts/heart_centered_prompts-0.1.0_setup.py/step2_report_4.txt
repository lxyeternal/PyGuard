  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior**\n\n- The code performs standard setup tasks: reading README.md, copying static prompt files from a local directory into the package during install, develop, or egg_info commands.\n- All file operations are filesystem-based, involving copying files from a known, trusted source directory (`prompts`) into the package structure.\n- No network activity, dynamic code execution, or user input handling is present.\n- No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The purpose appears solely to organize static prompt files for distribution.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Report**\n\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the script is benign, with a confidence of 1.0, and no malware or security risks.\n- They correctly identify that the script only copies static files and performs standard setup tasks.\n- No mention of potential issues such as mishandling of permissions, unintentional overwriting, or directory traversal vulnerabilities—though these are unlikely given the code's straightforward nature.\n- The reports do not identify any assumptions that could be invalid; they focus on filesystem operations that are safe in this context.\n\n**3. Scores and Their Reasonableness**\n\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are very low or zero, consistent with the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated scores are zero, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The risk scores are also appropriately low, given the code's straightforward, static file copying purpose.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**\n\n- No risk scores above 0.5 are justified here because the code does not perform any risky operations such as network calls, code injection, or handling untrusted input.\n- The highest risk score observed is 0.1, which is reasonable for minimal filesystem operations, but even that might be slightly conservative.\n\n**5. Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n\n- The scores align well with the code's behavior: no malware, no obfuscation, minimal security risk.\n- The assessments are consistent across reports.\n\n**6. Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**\n\n- The only potential concern could be if the prompts directory contains malicious files, but since the script only copies static `.txt` files from a known directory, and there's no execution of these files, this is not a security risk.\n- No assumptions about external inputs are made.\n- The code does not evaluate or execute the prompt files; it merely copies them.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the straightforward, static file copying with no external inputs or network activity, a risk score of **0.0 to 0.1** is appropriate.\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Code Safety:** The code is safe, standard setup logic.\n- **Malicious Behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, primarily due to filesystem operations, which are safe in this context.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| **0.0**         | **0.0**            | **0.0–0.1** |\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and purely for packaging static prompt files during setup.",
