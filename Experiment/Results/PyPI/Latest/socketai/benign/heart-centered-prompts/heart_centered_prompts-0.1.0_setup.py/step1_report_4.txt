  "purpose": "The script automates the setup process for the 'heart_centered_prompts' Python package, including copying prompt files into the package during installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file; accesses the project root directory; reads prompt files (*.txt) from the 'prompts' directory in the project root.",
  "sinks": "Copies prompt files to the package directory during installation, development, and egg info generation; no untrusted data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Reads prompt files from the 'prompts' source directory; copies them to the package data directory during setup commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or anomalies detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code simply copies files; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code reads static files such as README.md and prompt text files from a known directory within the project. It copies prompt files into package data directories during setup, development, and egg info commands. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are used. There are no network calls, no execution of untrusted code, nor data exfiltration mechanisms. The code performs typical setup tasks without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for packaging prompts with a Python project. It does not contain any malicious intent or malicious code. It merely copies static prompt files during package setup. No security risks or malware indicators are detected.",
