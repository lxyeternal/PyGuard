  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Provides a function `get_prompt()` that retrieves prompt text files based on validated parameters.\n- Uses `Path(__file__).resolve()` to locate the current script's directory.\n- Constructs a path to a prompt file within a subdirectory (`prompts/<collection>/<detail_level>.txt`).\n- Validates input parameters against predefined lists.\n- Reads and returns the content of the prompt file.\n- Includes error handling for invalid parameters and missing files with installation guidance.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  No, the code appears straightforward, with proper validation, filesystem access, and error handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Malware, obfuscation, or security risks?**  \n  The code does not perform network operations, code injection, or handle untrusted external input beyond validated parameters. The filesystem access is controlled and standard.\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** Clear, detailed, concludes the code is safe with no malware or security risks.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, confirms safe, local filesystem access, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, confirms safe, controlled filesystem access, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher `securityRisk` score (0.1), but justified as the filesystem read could be exploited if parameters were manipulated. However, input validation mitigates this.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.  \n- **Verdict:** Reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, confirms no malicious activity, proper validation, and safe filesystem access.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, and given the code's nature, this is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports are 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, justified by the controlled filesystem access and validation.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- The minimal `securityRisk` score of 0.1 in Report 4 is justified due to the filesystem access, but since validation is robust, even this could be considered 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** **0** — The code is a safe utility for static file retrieval, with proper validation and error handling.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The validation and error handling are appropriate, and the filesystem access is standard.\n\n**Working out the scores step-by-step confirms that the current assessments are reasonable.**",
