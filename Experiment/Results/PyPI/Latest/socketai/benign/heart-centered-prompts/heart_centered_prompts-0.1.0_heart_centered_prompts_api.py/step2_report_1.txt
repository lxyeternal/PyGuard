  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the underlying code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality and Logic:**\n   - The code provides a simple API function `get_prompt()` that retrieves prompt text files based on validated input parameters (`detail_level` and `collection`).\n   - It constructs a file path relative to the script's location and reads the content.\n   - Input validation prevents invalid parameters.\n   - Error handling provides informative messages if files are missing or parameters are invalid.\n   - The code uses standard Python modules (`pathlib`) and safe filesystem operations (`Path.resolve()`, `Path.open()`).\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Vulnerabilities:**\n   - No external network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n   - No use of untrusted input beyond validated parameters.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n   - The filesystem access is straightforward and controlled.\n   - Error messages are informative but do not leak sensitive info.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a benign, straightforward utility for loading static prompt files.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious intent are detected.\n   - The validation, path construction, and file reading are standard and secure.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the lack of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign very low or zero risk scores, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Overestimations:**\n   - The only minor point is the `securityRisk` score in report 4, which is 0.1—this is acceptable given the minimal filesystem access, but perhaps slightly overcautious.\n   - Overall, the scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n6. **Final Personal Assessment:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n   - **Risk Score:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal filesystem access, but not a security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a well-structured, safe utility for static prompt retrieval. No malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and aligned with the code's behavior.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a benign, secure implementation with no security risks.",
