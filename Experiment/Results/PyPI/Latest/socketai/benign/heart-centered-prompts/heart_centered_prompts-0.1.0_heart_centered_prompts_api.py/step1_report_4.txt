  "purpose": "Provide an API to retrieve heart-centered AI prompts based on specified detail levels and collections.",
  "sources": "The function reads from the filesystem at the path constructed from the current script's location plus a predefined relative path to prompt text files.",
  "sinks": "The filesystem read operation ('prompt_path.open') could potentially be exploited if path inputs were manipulated, but since inputs are validated and paths are constructed internally, no external untrusted input reaches the sink.",
  "flows": "Validated 'collection' and 'detail_level' inputs determine the prompt file path; if the file exists, its contents are read and returned. No external data flow leads directly into code execution or network actions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; input validation is correctly implemented, and filesystem access is straightforward and safe given the controlled inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to fetch prompt text files from a package directory structure. It validates inputs against predefined options, constructs a file path based on the script location, and reads the file contents. Error handling is in place for invalid inputs and missing files, with clear error messages. The code does not process untrusted user input for file paths beyond validation and does not perform network or system commands. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution is present. Usage of Path for file handling is secure and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a safe, straightforward file retrieval API for static prompt files. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security vulnerabilities. The structure and logic are sound, with proper validation and error handling. Overall, it poses minimal security risks.",
