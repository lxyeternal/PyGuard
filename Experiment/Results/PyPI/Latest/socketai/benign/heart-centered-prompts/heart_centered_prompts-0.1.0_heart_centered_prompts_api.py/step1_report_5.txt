{
  "purpose": "Provide an API to access heart-centered AI prompts stored as text files based on user-specified detail level and collection.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file's path (__file__), and the prompt text file located within the 'prompts' directory relative to the current file.",
  "sinks": "Reading the prompt file using Path.open() with specified encoding; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'detail_level' and 'collection' are validated; file path is constructed from local filesystem; prompt file contents are read and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code performs input validation and file reading only.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to retrieve prompt text files based on input parameters, validating inputs against predefined options. It constructs a filesystem path relative to the current file and reads a text file. The only potentially sensitive operation involves reading local files; no untrusted external inputs influence filesystem access beyond validated parameters. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic present. No network activity, data exfiltration, or external communication observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward file access API with input validation; it does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It appears to be a benign utility for retrieving prompt texts based on parameters, with no signs of security risks or malicious intent.",
