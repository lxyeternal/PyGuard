  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- All reports agree that the code performs input validation, constructs a filesystem path relative to the script's location, and reads prompt files accordingly.\n- The code uses Path.resolve() and Path.open() in a standard manner.\n- No external network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code is present.\n- Error handling for missing files and invalid parameters is implemented.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify that the code is a simple, safe file retrieval utility.\n- No mention of potential directory traversal issues is made, but given the input validation against predefined options, such risks are mitigated.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are generally very low or zero, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which seems appropriate given the code's behavior.\n- The \"obfuscated\" scores are 0, which is accurate.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are mostly 0 or very low (e.g., 0.1), reflecting minimal risk.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any high risk or malware scores**\n\n- No high risk or malware scores are assigned; all are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- The code does not perform any suspicious actions, nor does it process untrusted external input beyond validated parameters.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge any assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- The code's validation of parameters prevents invalid file access.\n- Since the prompt files are stored locally and the path is constructed based on the script's location, directory traversal attacks are unlikely.\n- The code does not execute or process untrusted input beyond parameter validation.\n\n**Step 6: Final assessment**\n\n- The code is a well-structured, safe utility for retrieving static prompt files.\n- No malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation is evident.\n- The risk scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — minimal security risk, given proper validation and local filesystem access only.\n\n**Final Justification:** The code is a benign, well-validated local file access utility with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or obfuscation. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The current scores are justified, and no changes are necessary.",
