  "purpose": "Provides an API to retrieve static prompt files based on user-specified detail level and collection, ensuring validated access to local filesystem resources.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'detail_level' and 'collection' for validation; filesystem path construction based on current script location.",
  "sinks": "Reading prompt files from local filesystem; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Validated parameters -> Path construction -> File existence check -> File read operation -> Return prompt content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Input validation is appropriate and prevents invalid access.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation against predefined options, constructs a filesystem path relative to the script's directory, and reads prompt files safely using Path.open(). No external network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. Error handling provides informative messages without leaking sensitive info. All security signals indicate benign behavior, with no anomalies or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the code's straightforward, safe design.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, well-structured utility for static prompt retrieval with no malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The scores of zero for malware and obfuscation, and a minimal security risk score, are justified and accurate.",
