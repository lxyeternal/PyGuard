{
  "purpose": "Provides an API to retrieve heart-centered AI prompts stored as text files, based on user-specified verbosity and collection type.",
  "sources": "Reads __file__ to determine current file location; accesses prompt files via Path operations.",
  "sinks": "Reads prompt files from the filesystem; does not process untrusted input from external sources.",
  "flows": "Uses __file__ to locate prompt files; reads prompt text files based on validated parameters; raises exceptions if files are missing or parameters invalid.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; proper validation of inputs; filesystem access is limited to predefined directories; no network activity or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation for the 'collection' and 'detail_level' parameters, constructs a filesystem path to retrieve prompt files, and reads their contents. It uses Path.resolve() and Path.open() for safe filesystem operations. No untrusted external input is directly processed beyond parameter validation. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code's purpose appears benign and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, controlled filesystem access pattern designed to retrieve predefined prompt text files. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, nor any indicators of malware or security risks.",
