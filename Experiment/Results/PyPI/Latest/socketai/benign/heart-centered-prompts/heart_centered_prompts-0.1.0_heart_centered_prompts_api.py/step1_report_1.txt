  "purpose": "Provides an API to retrieve heart-centered AI prompts based on specified detail levels and collections.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'detail_level' and 'collection' arguments; filesystem access via Path(__file__).resolve() and prompt_path.open()",
  "sinks": "Reading prompt files from the filesystem; no untrusted external network data flows identified",
  "flows": "Input parameters validated, then filesystem read operation occurs to load prompt text",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secret keys; no dynamic code execution; the file access is straightforward; no suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code validates input parameters against predefined lists to prevent invalid file access. It constructs a file path based on the script's location and attempts to read a prompt file. Error handling is implemented for missing files with guidance for proper installation. No use of external networks, no code injection, and no obfuscated or malicious logic are present. The filesystem access is standard and safe, with no indicators of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a safe API for retrieving predefined prompt files based on user-specified parameters. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The filesystem access appears standard and secure, with no suspicious anomalies.",
