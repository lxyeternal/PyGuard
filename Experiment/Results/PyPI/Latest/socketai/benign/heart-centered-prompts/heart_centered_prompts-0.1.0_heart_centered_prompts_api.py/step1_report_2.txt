  "purpose": "Provide an API to retrieve heart-centered AI prompts stored as text files based on user-specified detail level and collection.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __file__ variable to determine its own file location, and then reads a prompt text file from a subdirectory based on validated input parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code reads a local file specified by dynamically constructed path; no untrusted input is directly written to external locations or used in system commands.",
  "flows": "Input validation occurs on function arguments, then the code constructs a file path using validated parameters and the current file's directory, then reads the prompt content from that file.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated logic, or hidden behaviors. Use of Path methods and validation appears standard. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The function validates input parameters against predefined options to prevent invalid access. It constructs a local filesystem path relative to the current file's location and attempts to read a text file containing prompts. Error handling provides informative messages if files are missing or parameters invalid. No external network activity, no data exfiltration, and no code execution based on untrusted input are present. The code relies solely on local filesystem reads and standard Python modules, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured local file access API designed to serve static prompt files. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks such as backdoors, data theft, or malicious code injection. It is a benign utility for loading predefined prompts.",
