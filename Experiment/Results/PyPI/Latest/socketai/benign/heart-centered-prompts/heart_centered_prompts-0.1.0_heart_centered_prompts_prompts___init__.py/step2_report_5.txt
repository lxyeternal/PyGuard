  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a comment or descriptive text outlining that prompts are copied from the root directory during installation.\n- No executable code, data processing, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with obfuscation, malware, and security risk scores at 0.\n- The core claim across all reports is that there is no malicious activity or security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validations:\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code snippets are only comments/descriptions; no executable logic is present.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n- **Confirmed:** No issues or malicious activities are present.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent, all emphasizing the absence of executable code or suspicious behavior.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors detected.\n- **No mistakes identified.**\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- Malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- Security risk is 0, which aligns with the descriptive, non-executable nature.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, as no obfuscation is evident.\n- These scores seem reasonable given the content.\n\n**4. Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n- Since all content is purely descriptive comments with no executable or malicious code, higher scores are unjustified.\n- **Scores are appropriate and justified.**\n\n**5. Malware Score & Malicious Behavior:**\n- No malicious activity is described or implied.\n- The malware score of 0 is correct.\n- No need to challenge this.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- All reports avoid assumptions, simply describing the content.\n- No unwarranted claims or speculative vulnerabilities.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores:**\n- All scores are consistent with the described content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation & Recommendations:\n\nGiven the detailed review:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My own assessment aligns with the reports: the code is benign, purely descriptive, and poses no security threat.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- All reports are accurate in their conclusions.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action or escalation is necessary based on the provided content.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0**. The code is benign, and no security concerns are evident.",
