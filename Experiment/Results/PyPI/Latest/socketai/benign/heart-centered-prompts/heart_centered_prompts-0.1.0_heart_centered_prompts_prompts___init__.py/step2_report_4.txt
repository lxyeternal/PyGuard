  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code descriptions.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as merely a comment or descriptive text, with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity.\n- The core activity mentioned is copying prompts from the root project directory during installation, which is a standard resource management operation in package setup.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are identified.\n- Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty based on the provided descriptions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Critical Evaluation:\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code snippets are only comments/descriptions, not executable code.\n- No actual code performing file operations, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- Therefore, there are no security issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors to confirm.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in describing the code as non-executable, benign, and standard resource handling.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n- The conclusion that the code is harmless is justified.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- Malware score is 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk score is 0, also appropriate.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- No adjustments needed; the scores align with the described content.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n- All reports assign 0 risk, which is justified given the benign description.\n- No justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n**5. Malware Score Consideration:**\n- The description does not suggest any malicious activity.\n- Malware score remains at 0, which is correct.\n\n**6. Challenging Assumptions about Vulnerabilities:**\n- The reports assume that copying prompts during installation is benign, which is reasonable.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are unjustified; the content is non-executable.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores:**\n- All scores are consistent with the descriptions provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nGiven the descriptions, the code appears to be purely documentation or comments about the package's behavior. There is no executable code, no data flow, and no suspicious activity.\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and descriptive.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No further action or concern is warranted based on the provided content.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.**  \nThe code is safe, with no indication of malicious intent or security issues.",
