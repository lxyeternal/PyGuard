  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the reported issues, their reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe only comments or descriptive text indicating that the package copies prompts from the root directory during installation.\n- No executable code, functions, or scripts are provided; only comments or documentation.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or anomalies.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and discrepancies:\n\n- **Code presence:** The original code snippet is just a comment block. No executable code or logic is present. All reports correctly identify this.\n- **Malware potential:** Since there is no executable code, no malware activity can be inferred.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risk:** Based solely on comments, the risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Issue-by-issue review:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** All describe only descriptive comments, no executable logic.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **malware:** 0 — justified, no malicious code.\n  - **obfuscated:** 0 — justified.\n  - **securityRisk:** 0 — justified, no active risk.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores are reasonable and consistent with the content.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Are the scores overestimated?** No. Since the reports only contain comments, the scores of zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate.\n- **Are the reasons valid?** Yes. The reasoning correctly states that there's no executable code, no suspicious patterns, and only descriptive comments.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain at **0**.\n\n**Note:** Even if the description mentions copying prompts during installation, without actual code, this is just a benign documentation statement.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                   | No executable code or malicious activity present.           |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                   | No obfuscation detected; only comments/documentation.      |\n| Security Risk     | 0                   | No active or passive security risks evident.                |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Based on the provided reports and code snippet, I agree with the current scoring. The package appears benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
