  "anomalies": "The code mentions copying prompts during installation, which is normal for resource files; no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a descriptive comment outlining the behavior of the package, specifically that prompts are copied from the root directory during installation. There are no executable statements, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or other suspicious behaviors. Since it is only a comment, it does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscated code. The mention of copying prompts appears to be a standard resource handling process.",
