  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence presented, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as purely descriptive comments or documentation.\n- No executable code, data processing, network activity, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The mention of copying prompts during installation appears to be standard resource handling, not malicious behavior.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with obfuscated code, malware, and security risk scores of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The actual code snippet provided is only a comment describing behavior.\n   - No executable statements, data flows, or code logic are present.\n   - Therefore, **no issues are present** in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in describing the code as non-executable and benign.\n   - No logical flaws or assumptions are evident; the analysis correctly interprets the comments as standard resource handling.\n   - No overestimations or underestimations are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware = 0\n     - obfuscated = 0\n     - securityRisk = 0\n   - These are appropriate given the evidence.\n   - The confidence score of 1 is justified because the analysis is based on the provided comments, which are straightforward and non-suspicious.\n\n4. **Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since no malicious or suspicious activity is identified, the risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - No evidence suggests malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they interpret the comments as benign resource copying.\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are unjustified.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable scores are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** Only descriptive comments, no executable code.\n- **Malware Risk:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Code:** **0** — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk:** **0** — no security issues identified.\n- **Overall Risk:** Very low; the code appears benign.\n\n---\n\n### Personal Estimation (System-Level):\n\nBased on the provided content and analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions.\n\n**Proposed scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe current scores are appropriate, given the evidence.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nSince all reports are consistent and accurate, and the code is purely descriptive, no further action or concern is warranted. The package appears to be benign documentation about resource handling during installation.",
