{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up module exports for three classes: EnvManager, FileManager, and TerminalLogger, likely for managing environment variables, file operations, and terminal output respectively.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .env_manager, .file_manager, .terminal_logger",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data handling points are present in this snippet; no untrusted data processing observed",
  "flows": "No data flow or input-output pathways are explicitly defined in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code are present",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific classes from local modules and defines the __all__ list for exports. It does not include any logic, data handling, or external network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data flows, or security issues within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears to be a straightforward module export setup with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply organizes class exports for use elsewhere.",
