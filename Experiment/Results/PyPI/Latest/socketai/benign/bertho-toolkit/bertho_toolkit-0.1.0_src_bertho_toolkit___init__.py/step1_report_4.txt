  "purpose": "Module exports for environment management, file management, and terminal logging functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules (.env_manager, .file_manager, .terminal_logger).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; import statements do not process data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export statements with no obfuscated code or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module that imports three classes from relative modules and exports them via __all__. No data input, user interaction, or external communication is present. The code does not perform any logic, data processing, or network operations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are identified. This appears to be standard module setup code with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines exports for other modules to use.",
