  "purpose": "Re-exporting classes EnvManager, FileManager, and TerminalLogger for external use",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .env_manager, .file_manager, .terminal_logger",
  "sinks": "No sinks, no untrusted data handling or processing observed",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input, as the code only imports and exports classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific classes from local modules and defines __all__ for export. No data processing, user input handling, network activity, or potentially malicious behavior present. The code structure is straightforward and typical for package initialization or module export definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a simple module export mechanism with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
