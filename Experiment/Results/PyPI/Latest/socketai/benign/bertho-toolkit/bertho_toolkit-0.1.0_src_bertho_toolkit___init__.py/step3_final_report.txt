  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .env_manager, .file_manager, .terminal_logger.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Importing classes from local modules; defining __all__ for exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three classes from local modules and defines __all__ to specify exports. It performs no runtime logic, data processing, network communication, or handling of untrusted input. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export pattern with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports' assessments and scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
