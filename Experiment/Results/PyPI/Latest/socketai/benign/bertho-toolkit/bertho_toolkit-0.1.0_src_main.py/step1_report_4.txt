{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize logging and environment management tools, and runs a main task function.",
  "sources": "Import statements from bertho_toolkit; usage of TerminalLogger to log information and success messages",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows into security-critical functions or external systems",
  "flows": "The code initializes a logger, logs start and completion messages within run_my_task(), but no data flows indicating untrusted input processing",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom toolkit (bertho_toolkit) without transparency; no handling of user input or environment variables that could be malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code features observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports components from bertho_toolkit, creates a logger instance, and logs two messages during the execution of run_my_task(). There is no evidence of data input from external sources, nor any operations that could be exploited. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated code or suspicious logic. It relies on an external package whose security implications cannot be fully assessed, but based solely on this code snippet, there is no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic logging of a task lifecycle without any suspicious or malicious activity. It does not handle untrusted data, nor does it invoke operations that could harm or leak information. Overall, the code appears benign, though full security assessment of bertho_toolkit is outside this review.",
