  "purpose": "A simple Python script utilizing a custom logging toolkit to perform a main task with start and end logs.",
  "sources": "Import from 'bertho_toolkit' (TerminalLogger, EnvManager, FileManager); logging calls within run_my_task()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network calls, or data leaks present",
  "flows": "Initialization of logger -> Log start message -> (placeholder for main task) -> Log completion message",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward logging usage; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports a custom or third-party module, initializes a logger, and logs messages around a main task. No malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are evident. The external package 'bertho_toolkit' cannot be verified here, but the code itself is benign. No obfuscation or security flaws are detected. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the analysis. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the external dependency, but no malicious intent is demonstrated in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects reliance on an external package of unknown trustworthiness, but the code itself is straightforward and safe.",
