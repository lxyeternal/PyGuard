  "purpose": "This code initializes logging and environment management tools, then runs a main task function that logs start and end messages.",
  "sources": "Import statements from bertho_toolkit; use of TerminalLogger for logging",
  "sinks": "Logging functions, environment management, or file management functions (not explicitly used here)",
  "flows": "Code initializes logger, logs information, and runs main task, with no data flows involving untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed; the code structure is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports components from a third-party toolkit, sets up a logger with internal logging enabled, and logs informational and success messages during task execution. No user input handling, network activity, or data leaks are evident. The functions called are typical for logging and environment management, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign template for running a task with logging; no malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected based on the provided snippet.",
