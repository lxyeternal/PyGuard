  "purpose": "Manage file operations based on environment variables, including listing files, reading, and writing content.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via EnvManager; file paths provided to static methods read_file_content and write_file_content.",
  "sinks": "File reading and writing functions (open, read, write), and os.makedirs which could potentially be misused if file paths are malicious.",
  "flows": "Paths from environment variables are used to list files; file content read from untrusted sources; content written to specified paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses environment variables and standard file operations with no obfuscation. The class methods handle file paths dynamically without validation of file contents or paths beyond existence checks.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages file paths based on environment variables, listing files while ignoring specified temporary or sensitive files. Static methods handle reading and writing files with standard Python file I/O, including creating directories if needed. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected. Potential security concerns include: no validation of file paths (could be exploited for directory traversal), but such issues are common in file management code and not inherently malicious. Overall, the code appears to perform legitimate file management functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward file management utility that relies on environment variables for configuration. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. It performs standard file operations safely, with minimal security risks identified. The overall risk is low.",
