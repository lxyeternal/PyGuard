  "purpose": "Provides file management functionalities, including loading paths from environment variables, listing files recursively while ignoring certain files, and reading/writing file contents.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via EnvManager; file paths provided as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "File reading and writing functions (read_file_content and write_file_content).",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> Initialization of path attributes -> get_files_in_search_path (uses os.walk) -> read/write file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code constructs; no obfuscated code detected. Use of os.path and os.walk is standard; no dynamic code execution or misleading variables observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages file operations based on environment variables, which are fetched via EnvManager. The file listing function properly ignores certain system or temp files. Reading and writing files are straightforward and use standard libraries with no dangerous patterns. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. All functions operate within typical filesystem access, with no signs of malicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard utility module for file handling with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard file management utility with no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It correctly handles environment-based path configurations and safely performs file operations. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
