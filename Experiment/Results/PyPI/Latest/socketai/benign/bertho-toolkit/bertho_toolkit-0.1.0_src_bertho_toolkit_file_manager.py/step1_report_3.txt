{
  "purpose": "Provides file management operations including loading paths from environment variables, listing files recursively while ignoring specific files, and reading/writing file contents.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via EnvManager, file paths provided as function parameters, and local filesystem operations.",
  "sinks": "File read/write functions (read_file_content and write_file_content), and os.path.exists / os.makedirs for directory management.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → path variables; get_files_in_search_path uses SEARCH_PATH and append_path → accesses filesystem to list files; read/write methods access filesystem directly.",
  "anomalies": "Use of static methods for file operations is standard; no apparent hardcoded credentials or secrets. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behavior observed. Logging enabled via TerminalLogger, which is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes paths based on environment variables, listing files in a directory while ignoring specific temporary or irrelevant files. File reading and writing are straightforward, using standard Python practices. No input data from untrusted sources is directly executed or sent over the network. Environment variables are used for configuration, which is typical and not inherently malicious. The code does not contain any backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. The only potential concern could be if environment variables are maliciously set externally, but this is a common configuration approach and outside the code's control. Overall, no malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard file management operations with environment-based configuration. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. The design is typical for such utility modules and does not exhibit malicious intent.",
