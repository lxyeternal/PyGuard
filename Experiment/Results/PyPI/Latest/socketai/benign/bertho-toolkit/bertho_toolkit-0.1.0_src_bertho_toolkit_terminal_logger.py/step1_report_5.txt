{
  "purpose": "Provides a terminal logging class with color-coded messages for success, error, warning, internal logs, and informational messages.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided via method parameters such as message, reason, and overwrite_show_log.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data directly; all outputs are simple print statements formatting strings.",
  "flows": "User-supplied message strings are formatted with ANSI color codes and printed directly to the terminal; no untrusted data flows into external systems or resources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or unusual behaviors are present. The code uses static ANSI escape sequences and straightforward printing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for colored terminal output, utilizing static ANSI codes and printing methods. It accepts message strings and optional reasons, formatting and displaying them. No input sanitization or network operations are performed. The class does not process untrusted data beyond formatting and printing, and no code injection or malicious behaviors are evident. The implementation is standard for a logging utility with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign terminal logging utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely outputs formatted messages to the terminal and does not interact with external resources or handle sensitive data in a risky manner.",
