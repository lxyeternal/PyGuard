  "purpose": "Provide a terminal logging utility with colored output for various message types such as success, error, warning, internal logs, and informational messages.",
  "sources": "The class methods receive message strings and optional parameters as input.",
  "sinks": "Output is sent to the terminal via print statements, which are trusted display functions; no untrusted data flow to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Messages from method parameters are directly printed to standard output with color codes; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors observed. The code uses standard ANSI escape sequences for coloring and simple print statements.",
  "analysis": "The class implements basic terminal logging with color formatting. Input parameters are only used for display, with no data processing, injection, or external communication. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as network activity, file modifications, or credential handling, are present. The code appears to be a straightforward utility module with no obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a harmless terminal logger with color-coded messages. No signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks were detected. It is a benign utility module intended for user interface feedback.",
