  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward terminal logger with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with its functionality. The minimal security risk score (0.1) can be lowered to 0 for maximum accuracy, but even as 0.1, it remains very low. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
