  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks, external communication, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "The methods output formatted strings to the terminal via print, with no external data flows or untrusted data handling beyond message display.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code uses standard ANSI color codes and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The class is a simple utility for formatted terminal output. It contains no input parsing, external data processing, or system modifications. All methods are standard print statements with no malicious side effects. The code does not perform any network communication, file access, or data manipulation beyond message display. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for colored terminal messages, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
