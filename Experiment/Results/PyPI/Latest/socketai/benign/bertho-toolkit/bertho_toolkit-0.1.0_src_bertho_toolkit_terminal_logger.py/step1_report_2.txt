{
  "purpose": "Provide a terminal logger class for displaying color-coded messages in the terminal.",
  "sources": "Imports 'Optional' from 'typing'; no other data sources used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input data leading to vulnerabilities; primarily print statements for output.",
  "flows": "Method calls like LogSuccess, LogError, LogWarning, LogInternal, LogInformation generate terminal output. No untrusted data flows to critical security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The class simply outputs colored messages without any dynamic code execution or data handling that could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a terminal logger class using ANSI escape codes for colored output. It includes methods for different message types, all of which output text directly via print statements. There are no data inputs from untrusted sources affecting system state, no network communications, no file operations, nor any dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard utility class for colored terminal output. It contains no malicious behavior, no malicious data handling, and does not pose security risks. It is safe for use.",
