  "purpose": "Provide a terminal logger class for colored message output, including success, error, warning, internal, and informational messages.",
  "sources": "Input: message strings from method parameters; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Console output via print statements; no data leakage or untrusted data handling concerns.",
  "flows": "Method calls take message inputs and print formatted strings to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. No use of external inputs that could be malicious. The code is straightforward and purely for logging purposes. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for printing colored messages to the terminal using ANSI escape codes. It includes methods for various log levels and optional internal logging. There are no external data sources, no user inputs, no network communication, and no handling of sensitive data. The print statements are standard output calls with no suspicious or malicious logic. The class solely provides formatted terminal output, and no parts of the code suggest malicious intent or backdoors. The only potential concern might be if used improperly in untrusted environments, but as written, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign terminal logging utility with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is straightforward, with no suspicious or harmful code present.",
