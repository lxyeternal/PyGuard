{
  "purpose": "Manage environment variables stored in a '.env' file with loading, retrieving, setting, removing, and path building functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reading the '.env' file during load(), accessing environment variables via get(), get_with_prefix(), get_folder().",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no data leaks or system commands executed, and environment variables are only stored/read in memory and file.",
  "flows": "Loading environment variables from file to memory; retrieving variables from memory; updating or removing variables; constructing paths based on environment variable.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious or unusual code behavior; use of a potentially custom logger, but not inherently malicious; no code obfuscation or obfuscated code patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward environment variable manager that reads from and writes to a '.env' file. It supports typical operations such as load, get, set, remove, and path construction. There are no code injection points, external network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The use of a custom logger is benign unless maliciously tampered, which is unlikely given the code shown. The code correctly handles file operations and variable management without evident security flaws or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard environment manager with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. It manages environment variables securely within the scope of file I/O and in-memory caching. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are apparent.",
