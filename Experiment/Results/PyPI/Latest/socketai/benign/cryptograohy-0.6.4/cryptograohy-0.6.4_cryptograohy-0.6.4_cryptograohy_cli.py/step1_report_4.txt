  "purpose": "Initialize and run the emoji converter from the pyprettifier package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'pyprettifier', and the instantiation of 'EmojiConverter()'.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no data is read from or written to external sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "Import 'pyprettifier' -> instantiate 'EmojiConverter()' -> execute 'cli()' function.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports a third-party library only within a function scope, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a third-party library 'pyprettifier' inside a function, then creates an instance of 'EmojiConverter' without further actions. There are no external data inputs, no network activity, or file operations observed. The import is local to the function, which is uncommon but not suspicious by itself. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are apparent. The code is minimal and appears to serve a simple CLI purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward task of initializing an emoji converter from a third-party package, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code is simple and lacks suspicious patterns.",
