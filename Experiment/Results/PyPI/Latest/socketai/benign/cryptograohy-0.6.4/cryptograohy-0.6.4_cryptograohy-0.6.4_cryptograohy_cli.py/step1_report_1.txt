  "purpose": "Initialize and run an EmojiConverter object from the pyprettifier package via the command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Importing the pyprettifier module and creating an instance of EmojiConverter.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly send data over the network or write to files. No untrusted data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "Import pyprettifier -> create EmojiConverter instance -> run cli() function which executes the code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The module 'pyprettifier' is imported dynamically within the function, but this is standard practice for CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a CLI function that imports the pyprettifier library and instantiates an EmojiConverter object. The module is imported locally within the function, which could be to delay import or reduce startup time. The code then calls cli(). There are no visible network operations, file manipulations, or data leaks. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple CLI wrapper for the pyprettifier library, likely intended for user interaction or script execution. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It is a benign and typical implementation for a CLI entry point.",
