{
  "purpose": "A minimal CLI script that imports the 'pyprettifier' library and creates an 'EmojiConverter' instance, serving as a simple command-line utility.",
  "sources": "The import of 'pyprettifier' within the 'cli()' function, and the instantiation of 'EmojiConverter' inside that function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data leaks; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing 'pyprettifier' and creating an object; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The local import inside the function is unconventional but not suspicious; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a CLI function that imports a third-party library and instantiates an object, then calls the function immediately. No network, file, or data handling occurs. The import location is unusual but benign. All indicators point to a benign, straightforward script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign CLI wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1—are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
