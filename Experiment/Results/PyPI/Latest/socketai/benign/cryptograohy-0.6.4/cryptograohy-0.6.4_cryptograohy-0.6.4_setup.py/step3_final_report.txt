{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom post-install command that imports 'pyprettifier' and creates an 'EmojiConverter' instance during package installation.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pyprettifier' and instantiation of 'EmojiConverter' within '_post_install_action'. Exceptions caught during these operations are written to '/tmp/a'.",
  "sinks": "Writing exception messages to '/tmp/a', which could leak internal error details.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code attempts to import 'pyprettifier' and instantiate 'EmojiConverter'; exceptions are caught and logged to '/tmp/a'.",
  "anomalies": "Misspelling of package name 'cryptograohy'; exception messages are written to a temporary file; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign import and object creation with exception handling that logs errors. No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. The only minor concern is error message leakage and the misspelled package name, which could be typosquatting but are not inherently malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minor info leakage potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor concern is exception message leakage, which does not constitute malicious activity. The package appears safe for use.",
