{
  "purpose": "This script customizes the installation process of the 'cryptograohy' Python package, primarily to execute a post-installation action involving the 'pyprettifier' library.",
  "sources": "Input source is the import of 'pyprettifier' during post-install, and the writing of exceptions to '/tmp/a'.",
  "sinks": "Writing exception messages to '/tmp/a', which may leak error information; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "During installation, exceptions raised in '_post_install_action' are caught and logged to '/tmp/a'. No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks beyond error logging.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except to catch exceptions and log to a temporary file; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code; no code obfuscation; minor typo in package name 'cryptograohy'.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to perform an additional action post-installation, specifically importing 'pyprettifier' and creating an 'EmojiConverter' instance. Exceptions are caught and logged to '/tmp/a'. The package metadata appears benign, with no malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. There are no external data transmissions, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors identified. The error logging to a temp file is benign and does not indicate malicious intent but could leak error information if exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs a customized post-install step with safe error logging; no malicious or maliciously obfuscated code detected. The overall security risk is minimal, but minor concerns include the error logging practice.",
