  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by importing core functions and launching the CLI.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from '.core' and '.cly' modules, and calls the cli() function.",
  "sinks": "The cli() function is invoked directly; potential sink if cli() executes untrusted code or external commands.",
  "flows": "Imports from internal modules -> calling cli() -> potential execution of CLI-related code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py for a package, importing necessary modules and executing a command-line interface function. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident. The direct invocation of cli() suggests the CLI is triggered upon import, which could be unusual but not malicious per se. No external network activity or malicious code is visible here.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initialization script that immediately launches a CLI. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on this snippet.",
