  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by importing core functions and setting up the command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Imports from .core and .cly modules, specifically 'greet' and 'cli'.",
  "sinks": "The immediate call to 'cli()' upon import may trigger user interaction or command execution.",
  "flows": "Import statements → execution of 'cli()' during module import.",
  "anomalies": "Immediate invocation of 'cli()' during import, which is unconventional and can cause side effects but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions and calls 'cli()' immediately. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious imports are present. The main concern is the side effect of executing 'cli()' during import, which could lead to unexpected behavior or user prompts. The 'malware' score is justified as 0, given no malicious code is evident. The 'securityRisk' score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the potential for side effects but not malicious intent. Confidence is high (0.85), as the code is straightforward. Without knowledge of 'cli()' implementation, we cannot definitively assess maliciousness, but current evidence suggests none.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for a package's '__init__.py', with the only notable aspect being the immediate call to 'cli()'. This pattern is unconventional but not malicious. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary unless 'cli()' is found to perform unsafe operations.",
