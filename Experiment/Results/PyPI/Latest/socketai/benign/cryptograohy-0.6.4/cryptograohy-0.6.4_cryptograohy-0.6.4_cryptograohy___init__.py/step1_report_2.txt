{
  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by importing core functions and executing the CLI interface.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules 'core' and 'cly', and calls the 'cli()' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'cli()' function is invoked at the end; potential risk depends on what 'cli()' does, but not directly visible here.",
  "flows": "Modules are imported; 'cli()' is called immediately after import, executing its code.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual to call 'cli()' directly in __init__.py; this could lead to side effects during import, which is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'greet' from 'core' and 'cli' from 'cly', then immediately executes 'cli()'. This causes the command-line interface to run whenever the package is imported, which may be unexpected behavior but does not show malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or external network activities are visible. The primary concern is side effects during import, but no malicious actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily initializes the package and runs a CLI. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet. The immediate execution of 'cli()' during import is unconventional but not malicious.",
