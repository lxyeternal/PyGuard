  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by importing modules and executing the CLI.",
  "sources": "Import statements for .core and .cly modules, execution of cli() function.",
  "sinks": "Execution of cli() may process untrusted input if the CLI handles user input unsafely.",
  "flows": "Imports -> cli() function call",
  "anomalies": "Direct call to cli() at import time; potential for executing user input if cli() processes arguments without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two modules, then immediately calls the cli() function. Since cli() is invoked during import, it suggests the script is designed to run a command-line interface upon import. Without seeing the implementation of cli(), potential risks include executing untrusted input or commands prematurely. However, nothing in the code explicitly indicates malicious behavior or hidden backdoors. The structure appears straightforward and typical for CLI tools. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are present. The immediate invocation of cli() could be a concern if cli() handles unvalidated input, but on its own, this code does not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply imports modules and runs a command-line interface, which is standard for CLI applications. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks is apparent from this fragment alone.",
