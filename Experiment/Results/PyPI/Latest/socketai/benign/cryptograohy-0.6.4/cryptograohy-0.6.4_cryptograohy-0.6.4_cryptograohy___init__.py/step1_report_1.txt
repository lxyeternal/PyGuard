{
  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by importing modules and executing the CLI command.",
  "sources": "Imports from .core and .cly modules, execution of cli() function.",
  "sinks": "The cli() function is called, which could potentially perform user interaction or system operations depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Imported functions (greet and cli) are loaded; cli() is executed immediately, which may process command-line input or trigger other actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or unusual code patterns. The immediate call to cli() at import time is notable but not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing two functions and invoking cli() immediately. Since the content of cli() is unknown, the potential for malicious activity depends on its implementation. No suspicious behavior or malicious patterns are evident within this snippet itself. The pattern of executing cli() on import could be considered risky in some contexts but is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to initialize the package and run the command-line interface upon import. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are detected within this code snippet. The security risk is minimal, assuming the imported modules are safe and cli() does not perform harmful actions.",
