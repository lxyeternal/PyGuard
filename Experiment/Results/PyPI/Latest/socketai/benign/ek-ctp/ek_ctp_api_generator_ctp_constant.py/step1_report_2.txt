{
  "purpose": "This code defines a series of constant string mappings for various financial, trading, and system statuses and types used in a financial trading system API or SDK.",
  "sources": "These constants are likely used as lookup tables or enumerations within the system; no input reading or external data sources are directly evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data outputs, network calls, or file operations are present; the code solely assigns constant values.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only contains static constant definitions without dynamic execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a very large list of string-to-string constant mappings; nothing unusual, suspicious, or obfuscated in format. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a comprehensive set of constant definitions mapping identifiers to string values, likely for use throughout a trading system. The pattern is consistent: constants assigned static string values, primarily digits or characters, serving as enumerations or status codes. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external communication, nor any code that performs logic or decision-making. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection are present. The purpose appears to be providing standardized constants for system-wide use.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static configuration/constants file defining numerous enums used in a trading or financial system. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, no backdoors, nor obfuscated or suspicious code segments. The overall security risk score is very low, with no signs of malicious intent.",
