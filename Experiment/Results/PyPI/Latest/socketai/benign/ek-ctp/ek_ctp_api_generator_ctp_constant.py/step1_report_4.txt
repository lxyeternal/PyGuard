{
  "purpose": "This code defines a comprehensive set of constant mappings for various identifiers, statuses, and types used within a financial trading system, likely for configuration, reference, and standardized communication.",
  "sources": "Constants are assigned string literals, typically single characters, which appear to be hardcoded mappings and identifiers used throughout the system.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks such as network operations, file I/O, command execution, or data handling functions that could process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic data flows from external sources to potentially dangerous sinks; the code is purely declarative mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present. The code consists solely of static constant assignments with no logic, function calls, or data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "This file is a static configuration or constants definition module containing numerous identifier mappings with no executable code, input handling, or output generation. It appears to serve as a reference for other modules within a trading system. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident in the provided content. The constants are formatted uniformly as key-value pairs, with no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious injection. The file is well-structured and purely declarative.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only static constant definitions serving as lookup mappings. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The content is safe and primarily used for standardizing identifiers within a larger financial trading application.",
