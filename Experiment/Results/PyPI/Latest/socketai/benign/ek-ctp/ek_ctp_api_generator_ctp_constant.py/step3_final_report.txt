  "purpose": "Static enumeration and configuration constants for system parameters, statuses, and identifiers used in a trading platform.",
  "sources": "Constant variable assignments, typically used as enums or lookup tables within the codebase.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process input or output data, nor does it execute logic that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "None; purely static mappings without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward constant definitions with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments representing various system statuses, types, error codes, and identifiers. No executable logic, data processing, or dynamic code is present. The constants are typical for configuration or enum purposes in a trading system. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns are detected. The risk of malicious activity is negligible; the primary concern could be external tampering during supply chain distribution, which is outside the code scope. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscation score 0, and the overall security risk is minimal, approximately 0.1, reflecting external supply chain considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of constants serving as enums or configuration mappings. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The risk is primarily external (tampering), not intrinsic to the code. The current scores are appropriate and indicate a safe, non-malicious module.",
