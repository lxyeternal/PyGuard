  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of constants serving as enums or configuration mappings. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The risk is primarily external (tampering), not intrinsic to the code. The current scores are appropriate and indicate a safe, non-malicious module."
