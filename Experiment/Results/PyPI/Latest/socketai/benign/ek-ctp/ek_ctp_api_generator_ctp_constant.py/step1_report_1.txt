  "purpose": "Definition of constant mappings for various trading, risk, and system parameters used within a financial trading platform or API.",
  "sources": "None; this is a series of constant variable assignments and string mappings.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input, or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "None; these are static constant definitions without data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of numerous constant assignments with descriptive names, which is typical for configuration or enum-like structures. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present. No unusual or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a comprehensive set of string constant mappings used as enums or parameter definitions in a financial trading system. It does not contain executable logic, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. All constants seem to be standardized identifiers for system parameters, statuses, or types, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or data leaks are detected. The code appears to serve as a static reference for other modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward collection of constant mappings and does not include any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a configuration or enumeration module integral to a trading platform, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
