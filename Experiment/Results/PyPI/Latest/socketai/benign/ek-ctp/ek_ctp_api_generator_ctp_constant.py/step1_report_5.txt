{
  "purpose": "The code defines a comprehensive set of constant mappings for a financial trading system, including status codes, error codes, account types, transaction types, and various configuration parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from static assignments of string constants assigned to variables with specific naming conventions, primarily for use as code mappings or enumerations.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any input or data processing mechanisms that would serve as sinks for untrusted data; it solely contains static constant definitions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or untrusted data propagation paths since the code only contains static constants without logic, input handling, or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The code strictly consists of constant definitions with clear naming conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a large set of constant mappings for various trading and system statuses, identifiers, and configuration codes. It uses straightforward variable assignments with string literals representing enumerated types. There are no input or output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no cryptographic or network-related functions. The constants appear to serve as enumerations for a trading platform’s internal logic, error codes, status indicators, and configuration flags. The structure is consistent and methodical, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. The data is static and non-sensitive, used for standard application logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of constant definitions for a trading system, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is likely used as part of a larger application for status code mapping and configuration management. No suspicious activity or malware signals are present.",
