  "purpose": "Import statements for trading API modules and constants, likely part of a larger trading system.",
  "sources": "Local module imports: .vnctpmd, .vnctptd, .ctp_constant",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data sources present in this snippet",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules; no data flow or execution beyond module loading",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules related to trading APIs. No executable logic, data processing, or network activity is present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of these imports, assigning a malware score of 0, low security risk (~0.1), and no obfuscation. Given the limited scope, there are no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent and justified, with high confidence in the benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign import section of a trading system. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
