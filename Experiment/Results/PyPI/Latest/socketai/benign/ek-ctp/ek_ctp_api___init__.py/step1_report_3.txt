  "purpose": "Importing modules and constants related to a trading API or system.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes and constants from local modules: .vnctpmd, .vnctptd, and .ctp_constant.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sources or sinks are evident in these import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable here as these are import statements only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from relative modules, likely part of a larger trading or financial system. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are detectable in these lines. There are no sources of untrusted input, no data flows, and no suspicious code structures. These imports suggest modular design, focusing on market data and trading API functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of import statements for trading API components, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, legitimate project related to trading systems.",
