  "purpose": "Importing modules and constants related to a trading API, likely for market data and trading operations.",
  "sources": "Module imports from local package files (.vnctpmd, .vnctptd, .ctp_constant). No external data sources are explicitly used in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or execution of untrusted data are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this code only performs import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious constructs observed; the code is straightforward import statements without obfuscated or unusual syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and constants from local modules, presumably part of a larger trading system or API. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code. The snippet is limited to module imports without any operations or logic that could be malicious. Given the simplicity, no security concerns are apparent from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard import statements for a trading API or framework. There are no indications of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks in this snippet.",
