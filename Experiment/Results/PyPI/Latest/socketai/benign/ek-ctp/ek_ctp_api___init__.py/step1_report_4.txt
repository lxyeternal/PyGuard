  "purpose": "This code imports modules related to trading APIs and constants, likely for interacting with trading or financial data systems.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .vnctpmd, .vnctptd, and .ctp_constant",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data processing or external output functions shown",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths present in the snippet",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements for modules and constants, which is common in modular Python projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious API calls. The use of relative imports suggests it's part of a larger package, but no malicious code or suspicious behavior is evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet is standard module import statements with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a trading application or library setup.",
