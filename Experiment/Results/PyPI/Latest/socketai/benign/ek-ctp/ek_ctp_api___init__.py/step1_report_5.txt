  "purpose": "The code imports modules related to trading APIs and constants, likely part of a trading or financial application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .vnctpmd, .vnctptd, and .ctp_constant.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible with only import statements; these define dependencies but do not process data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code simply imports modules.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs import operations from local modules, likely for trading API functionality. No data is read from external sources or environment variables. No potentially dangerous operations are visible. The minimal code does not contain any executable logic or data handling that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward import statement setup for a trading system. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment. It appears to be a standard module import pattern.",
