{
  "purpose": "To manage the versioning information of the 'ek_ctp' package and import a specific module from the package.",
  "sources": "importlib_metadata.version() call to retrieve package version; importing CtpGateway from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "The version information is stored in __version__, which is not a sink for untrusted data; importing CtpGateway could be a sink if used insecurely elsewhere, but not directly in this code.",
  "flows": "importlib_metadata.version() reads package metadata, then assigns to __version__; the imported CtpGateway is loaded for use but not executed here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs standard package version retrieval and module import.",
  "analysis": "The code includes standard license comments and a typical pattern for retrieving package version information using importlib_metadata. The fallback to 'dev' if the package is not found is normal. Importing a module locally is common practice. No indications of malicious or suspicious behavior are observed. The overall structure is straightforward and aligns with typical package initialization code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard package management code with no malicious intent or security risks. It only retrieves version information and imports a module, which is typical for Python packages.",
