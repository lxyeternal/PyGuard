  "purpose": "Retrieve the package version information for 'ek_ctp' and import the local module 'CtpGateway'.",
  "sources": "importlib_metadata.version() call and the relative import of .gateway.CtpGateway.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads package metadata; imports local module; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward and standard code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package initialization snippet that retrieves version info and imports a local module. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The license header is standard, and the code is clear with no obfuscation. The retrieval of version info is benign and commonly used for package management. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security flaws are present. The minimal risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports is justified due to the version retrieval, but overall, the code is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and assign low risk scores. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior, and no modifications are necessary.",
