  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard version retrieval and local import.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical package setup code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low, justified due to version handling).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no issues. The small security risk score reflects minimal concern due to version fallback, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard package initialization, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical version retrieval and import, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard package setup code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score due to version info retrieval, but still justified as benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external output.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical initialization code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (score=0). The code is purely for package version management and local imports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied, mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal security concern due to package version handling, which is standard practice.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions.\n- No data is processed from untrusted sources that could lead to code injection or data exfiltration.\n- The version retrieval and import statements are typical and safe.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports, justified by the package version handling, which is benign but slightly noteworthy in security assessments)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard package setup code with no malicious intent or security risk. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.",
