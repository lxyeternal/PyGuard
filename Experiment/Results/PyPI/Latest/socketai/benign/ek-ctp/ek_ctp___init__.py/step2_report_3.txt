  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard version retrieval and local import.\n- Sources: importlib_metadata.version() and local module import.\n- Sinks: None processing untrusted data.\n- Flows: Reads package metadata; no data leakage.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Very typical package initialization code; no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Manage version info and import module.\n- Sources: Same as above.\n- Sinks: No data leakage.\n- Flows: Reads package info, imports module.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard pattern, no suspicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Define license, import module.\n- Sources: Same as above.\n- Sinks: No untrusted data processing.\n- Flows: Same as above.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical package setup, no malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Retrieve package version and import component.\n- Sources: Same.\n- Sinks: No data leaks.\n- Flows: Read-only metadata.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard, benign package code.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — acceptable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Package initialization.\n- Sources: Same.\n- Sinks: No suspicious data processing.\n- Flows: Metadata retrieval, local import.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical pattern, no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. Given the code is just package metadata retrieval and local imports, this score should remain 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation present; scores are correctly 0.\n- **Risk score:** The minimal risk assigned (0.1) in some reports seems reasonable, as this is standard package code with no evident security issues.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- The code is standard, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- The risk score could be slightly lowered to 0 for complete certainty, but 0.1 is acceptable given the potential for future misuses if dependencies are compromised.\n\n### **My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and typical for package initialization.",
