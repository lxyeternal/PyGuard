  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code, its logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a typical package initialization snippet, retrieving version info and importing a local module.\n- No untrusted input processing, external data transmission, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The license header is standard, and the import statements are straightforward.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The only potentially noteworthy aspect is the retrieval of package version info, which is benign in this context.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### 1. **Malware Score: 0**\n- All reports assign malware score as 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are evident.\n\n#### 2. **Obfuscated Score: 0**\n- The code is clear, with no obfuscation or code hiding techniques.\n\n#### 3. **Risk Score: 0.1**\n- The risk score is low, reflecting minimal security concern.\n- The only slight concern could be if the version info were used insecurely elsewhere, but in this snippet, it's harmless.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, all reports correctly identify this as standard package initialization code with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there any errors or flaws?**  \n  No, the reasoning is consistent; the code is straightforward and safe.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes, the scores align with the code's nature.\n\n- **Justification for higher scores?**  \n  Since there's no malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  The reports avoid assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (consistent with the reports, given the minimal risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- The code is a standard, safe package initialization snippet.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.\n- The only minor concern is the retrieval of package version info, which is benign here.\n\n**Therefore, I conclude:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's nature.",
