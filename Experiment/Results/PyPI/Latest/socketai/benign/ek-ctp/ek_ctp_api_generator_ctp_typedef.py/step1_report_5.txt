{
  "purpose": "Define various data types as string, char, int, or double for a trading system or financial application.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; primarily type definitions and constants.",
  "sinks": "No code that processes untrusted input or performs data manipulation.",
  "flows": "No data flow between sources and sinks; mainly static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of type alias declarations without executable logic, data processing, or external data handling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments observed. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions used to standardize data formats in a financial or trading system. It appears to be an auto-generated or manually curated list of type aliases mapping identifiers to basic data types. No malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden code, are present. The definitions are purely declarative and serve as part of a larger codebase, likely to enforce data consistency and type safety.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within these type definitions. The code is benign, serving as a foundational component of a trading platform or financial data processing system. No malicious or suspicious patterns detected.",
