{
  "purpose": "Define various data types as string, char, int, or double for use in a financial trading system, likely as type aliases or constants.",
  "sources": "These definitions are static assignments without dynamic input, reading, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or interact with external systems directly.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; this code solely establishes type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. No obfuscation or hidden logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type alias definitions for a trading system, using simple string, char, int, and double types. It is purely declarative, setting up types for later use. No functions, control flow, or dynamic operations are present. It appears to be a standard header or type definitions file intended for use in a larger codebase. No evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within these definitions. The absence of dynamic code, external data handling, or network operations suggests very low likelihood of malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of type definitions with no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks detected. It functions as a static configuration or type aliasing, common in large software systems for clarity and consistency. Overall security risk is negligible.",
