{
  "purpose": "Define various type aliases for data fields used in a financial trading system, primarily string, char, int, double types for different data elements.",
  "sources": "Declaration of type aliases without any data input or external data reading points.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations; no untrusted data handling or external communication evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing logic; solely type alias definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data handling, or logic; only type definitions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. No obfuscated code, malicious commands, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists exclusively of type alias definitions for a large number of data elements related to financial trading systems. There are no functions, data manipulations, input/output operations, or external calls. The types are mainly string, char, int, and double, with some specific domain-related names. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code appears to be a straightforward schema or type mapping for a larger system. No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of type definitions for data fields in a financial trading application. It contains no executable logic, data flow, or external communication, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a standard schema or declaration file with no security risks.",
