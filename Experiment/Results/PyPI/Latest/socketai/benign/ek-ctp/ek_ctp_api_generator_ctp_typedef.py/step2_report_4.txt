  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the provided code carefully.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a large collection of type alias definitions, mapping variable names to primitive data types (string, int, double, char).\n- It is purely declarative, with no executable logic, data processing, network communication, or external data handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The code appears to serve as a schema or interface for a trading system API, emphasizing type safety and clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Type alias definitions for a trading system API.\n- Findings: No data flow, no data handling, no external interactions.\n- Anomalies: Only type definitions, no executable code.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no malicious intent.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Define data types for a trading system.\n- Findings: No data processing or external interactions.\n- Anomalies: Pure type declarations.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Type alias definitions for a financial trading system.\n- Findings: Static definitions, no data input or external data sources.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code.\n- Conclusion: Low likelihood of malicious intent.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Data type definitions for a trading application.\n- Findings: No executable logic or external data handling.\n- Anomalies: Only type alias declarations.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Type definitions for a financial system.\n- Findings: No data processing or external interactions.\n- Anomalies: Pure static declarations.\n- Conclusion: Benign, foundational code.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\n\n**All reports agree that this code is a set of static type alias definitions with no executable logic, data flow, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks.**\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hiding techniques)\n\n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk or attack surface)\n\n---\n\n### My expert estimate:\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is purely definitional, serving as a schema or interface for a trading system, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, benign, and poses no security threat.",
