{
  "purpose": "The code defines a comprehensive set of type aliases for various data elements used in a trading system API, serving as a schema or interface for data consistency and clarity.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from static type alias declarations, which assign primitive data types (string, int, double, char) to variable names representing trading data fields.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or external data is handled; the code contains only type definitions without data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist in this code; it is purely declarative with no executable logic, data processing, or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code consists solely of straightforward type alias definitions with no suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static collection of type alias definitions for a trading system API, with no executable functions, data handling, or external interactions. It does not contain secrets, credentials, or malicious logic. The uniformity and simplicity indicate a benign schema file. The reports correctly identify this and assign low malware, obfuscation, and risk scores. The data flow is nonexistent, and the code's purpose is purely declarative, posing no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static schema definition with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
