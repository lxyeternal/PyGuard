  "purpose": "Definition of various type aliases for a trading system API, used for type safety and clarity.",
  "sources": "N/A (no data input, external data, or untrusted sources in the code).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no data processing, no output, no untrusted data handling or external calls).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow, no source-to-sink paths present).",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of type alias declarations, with no executable code, data handling, or network operations. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a comprehensive list of type alias definitions for various data types used in a trading system API. It only includes type alias declarations using strings, integers, doubles, and chars for different data elements. There are no functions, external calls, data handling, or input/output operations. The structure is purely definitional, serving as a schema or interface for type safety. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. The absence of executable code or data processing means there's no attack surface or security concern within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of type definitions for API data types. It contains no executable logic, data handling, network communication, or secrets that could be malicious. It appears safe and purely structural, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
