{
  "purpose": "This code defines a comprehensive set of type aliases for various data types used in a trading system or financial application, primarily for defining data structures and protocols.",
  "sources": "Type alias definitions for variables and data fields, primarily consisting of string, char, int, double types assigned to descriptive variable names.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or data flow operations are present; the code is purely declarative with type definitions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or operations from sources to sinks; the code only establishes type aliases without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is purely type definitions with no control flow, data processing, or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of type alias declarations, mapping variable names to primitive data types. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or external interactions. It appears to be a set of schema definitions or interface types used for a trading system. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code, is evident. The absence of executable logic and network operations indicates low likelihood of malicious intent. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a schema or type alias mapping for data fields in a trading system. It contains no malicious behavior or suspicious code, solely defining data types for use elsewhere. The risk of supply chain attack or malicious sabotage is extremely low.",
