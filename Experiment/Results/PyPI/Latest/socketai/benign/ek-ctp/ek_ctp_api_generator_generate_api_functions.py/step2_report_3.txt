  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically, considering the code, its behavior, and potential security implications.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a Python script that reads C++ header files related to a trading API.\n- It dynamically imports modules named based on a prefix (e.g., '{prefix}_struct') to load struct definitions.\n- It parses header files to identify callback functions (On*) and request functions (Req*).\n- It generates multiple C++ header and source files to implement API wrappers, callback handlers, and module definitions.\n- The code performs straightforward file I/O, string processing, and code generation based on parsed data.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present in the code:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears to be a structured, well-organized code generator. No obvious bugs or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Malicious activity or malware:** No network calls, code injection, or execution of untrusted code during runtime are present.\n- **Dynamic import risks:** The use of `importlib.import_module` based on a string constructed from known parameters is generally safe if the parameters are controlled. If external input influences the module name, there could be a risk, but in the current context, it seems controlled.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:\n- The reports correctly identify the dynamic import as a potential surface for misuse if parameters are externally manipulated. However, given the context, this appears to be an intended, controlled feature.\n- The reports suggest no malicious intent or obfuscation, which aligns with the code's straightforward design.\n- No report mentions any actual code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n### Scores and their justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a 0, which is appropriate. The code does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation, but generally low (0.1 - 0.2). This is reasonable given the controlled nature of the code, with the only concern being the dynamic import if parameters are manipulated externally.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- The reports are consistent with each other, all concluding no malicious activity.\n- The dynamic import is a minor concern but not a significant security risk here.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, mostly related to dynamic import control)\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to dynamic import potential if parameters are externally manipulated)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured code generator for C++ API wrappers. No malicious or obfuscated behaviors are evident. The primary concern is the dynamic import mechanism, which should be controlled via input validation if exposed externally, but in this context, it appears safe.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments and would assign similar scores.**",
