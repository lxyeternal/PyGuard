{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically generates C++ header and source files based on input lines read from a specified file, primarily to create API wrapper functions, callback handlers, and module definitions for a trading API interface.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a file specified by 'filename' parameter in the run() method; imports a module named based on 'prefix' + '_struct'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes generated code to multiple output files, but no direct untrusted data execution or code injection points are evident; no network or system command execution is present.",
  "flows": "Input file content -> process_line() -> process_callback()/process_function() -> generate_*() methods -> output files; imported module -> load_struct() -> data used in code generation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. Code performs structured code generation based on input lines and module attributes. No obfuscation or malicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The script performs systematic code parsing and generation tasks: it reads input lines, processes callbacks and functions, generates header and source files, and handles code templates. The imported module is used to load struct definitions dynamically, which are then used for data processing. No network activity, system commands, or hidden malicious behavior is observed. The code's purpose aligns with API wrapper generation, which is a legitimate activity. The code appears to be well-structured and purposeful without indications of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate code-generation utility tailored for API wrapper creation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious code patterns, or security risks. No indicators of malware or sabotage are present based on the provided source.",
