{
  "purpose": "The code processes C++ header files to generate Python constants and typedefs for data type mappings and macro definitions.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a specified C++ header file ('../include/ctp/ThostFtdcUserApiDataType.h') line by line.",
  "sinks": "Writes processed data to two Python files: '{prefix}_constant.py' and '{prefix}_typedef.py'.",
  "flows": "Reads header file lines -> Processes 'define' and 'typedef' statements -> Writes corresponding Python variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no use of dynamic code execution, no suspicious URL or network activity. No obfuscated code features detected. The code performs straightforward file parsing and writing operations.",
  "analysis": "The script performs static parsing of a C++ header file to generate Python variable definitions and type mappings. It safely reads input files, processes each line without executing any external or dynamic code, and writes outputs to Python files. No user input, network activity, or system commands are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or code injection. The only potential concern is if the input file contains malicious content, but that is outside the scope of this static review. Overall, the script appears to serve a benign purpose of code generation with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static data processing script that generates Python definitions from a C++ header file. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are detected. It performs straightforward file I/O and string processing for code generation purposes.",
