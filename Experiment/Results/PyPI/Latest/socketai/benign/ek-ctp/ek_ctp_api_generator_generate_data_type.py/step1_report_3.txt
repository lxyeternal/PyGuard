{
  "purpose": "The script converts C++ header definitions (#define and typedef) into Python variable declarations for constants and type mappings.",
  "sources": "Reading input from a specified C++ header file ('../include/ctp/ThostFtdcUserApiDataType.h') line by line.",
  "sinks": "Writing output to Python files ('_constant.py' and '_typedef.py'), which contain the generated variable assignments.",
  "flows": "Input file is read line-by-line; relevant lines are parsed and processed; results are written to output Python files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscated logic, or hidden behaviors. The code does not perform network operations, system modifications, or secret data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly reads a C++ header file, processes '#define' and 'typedef' lines, and writes corresponding Python variable declarations. It uses simple string parsing and file I/O without any dynamic code execution or external dependencies. No hardcoded secrets, no malicious logic, and no indications of sabotage or covert channels are present. The code's purpose appears to be a simple and transparent conversion utility. It does not include any suspicious or malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for converting C++ data type definitions to Python variables. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It functions solely as a code transformation tool without any harmful side effects.",
