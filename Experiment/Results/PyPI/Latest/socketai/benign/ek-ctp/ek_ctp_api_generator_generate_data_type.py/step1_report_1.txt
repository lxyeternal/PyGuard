{
  "purpose": "The code reads a C header file to generate Python files defining constants and type mappings based on the header's content.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a specified C header file ('../include/ctp/ThostFtdcUserApiDataType.h').",
  "sinks": "Writes output to two Python files ('ctp_constant.py' and 'ctp_typedef.py'), generating Python code based on the header file content.",
  "flows": "Reads lines from the header file -> processes '#define' and 'typedef' statements -> writes formatted Python code to output files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward parsing of C preprocessor directives and typedefs to generate corresponding Python code. It processes only specific lines, with no network operations, data leaks, or malicious logic. The use of file operations is safe and limited to reading and writing local files. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple, safe code generator translating C header definitions into Python constants and type mappings. It exhibits no malicious behavior or security risks.",
