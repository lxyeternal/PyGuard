{
  "purpose": "Converts C/C++ header definitions (#define and typedef) into Python variable assignments for constants and type mappings.",
  "sources": "Reads lines from the header file, specifically lines starting with #define and typedef.",
  "sinks": "Writes to two Python files: one for constants and one for type definitions.",
  "flows": "Input header lines are parsed and transformed into Python assignment statements, then written to output files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. No dynamic execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file reading, string processing, and writing output. It does not execute code, handle secrets, or perform any system modifications. The parsing logic is simple and safe. The only potential concern is malicious content in the input file, but this is outside static analysis scope. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the script and the minimal risk posed by untrusted input files.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, static utility for converting header definitions into Python code. It contains no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minor security risk score reflects the potential risk if the input file is malicious, but the script itself is safe.",
