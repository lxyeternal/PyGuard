{
  "purpose": "The code converts C++ header file definitions and typedefs into Python variable declarations, generating Python files with constants and type mappings.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a C++ header file ('../include/ctp/ThostFtdcUserApiDataType.h') line by line.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to two Python files ('{prefix}_constant.py' and '{prefix}_typedef.py'), defining constants and type mappings.",
  "flows": "Reads lines from the C++ header file -> Processes lines based on whether they are #define or typedef -> Writes corresponding Python variable assignments to output files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs file reading, string processing, and writing output files. It parses #define and typedef lines, converting them into Python code. The process is straightforward and does not include any obfuscated code or malicious logic. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious commands are present. The only potential concern is the handling of input files, but in this context, it is benign and for code conversion purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple parser and converter for C++ header definitions to Python. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks within this code. It functions purely as a data processing utility.",
