{
  "purpose": "The script converts C++ header file definitions (#define and typedef) into Python variable assignments for constants and type mappings.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a C++ header file specified by filename; processes each line for defines and typedefs.",
  "targets": "Writes output to two Python files: one for constants and one for type definitions.",
  "flows": "Reads header file lines -> processes line -> if define or typedef, transforms and writes to output files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors detected. The code only performs file reading and writing, standard parsing, and simple data transformation.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a C++ header file, extracts #define constants and typedefs, and writes equivalent Python variable assignments. It uses standard string operations and file I/O with no external network access, no code injection, and no suspicious behavior. No embedded commands or malicious logic are observed. The code is straightforward, focusing solely on code translation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for code conversion with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs simple parsing and file output operations without any harmful actions.",
