  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the code accordingly.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a massive collection of static constant definitions mapping descriptive variable names to string literals, typically single characters.\n- There are no functions, data flows, dynamic logic, or runtime data processing.\n- No external input, output, or data manipulation is present.\n- The constants cover a wide range of system states, categories, types, and codes used in a financial trading system.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or hidden code are evident.\n- The structure is straightforward, consistent, and typical for enum-like definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on the code:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** The reports correctly identify that the code is static, straightforward, and does not contain malicious logic.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The code appears syntactically correct, well-structured, and consistent.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the static nature and lack of malicious indicators. Security risk scores are also 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Specific analysis per report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Describes constants for configuration/protocol communication.  \n- No issues found.  \n- Malware: 0, Security risk: 0, Confidence: 1.  \n- **Score is reasonable.**\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Enumerations for statuses and types.  \n- No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.  \n- Malware: 0, Security risk: 0, Confidence: 0.9.  \n- **Score is reasonable.**\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Constants for API codes.  \n- No dynamic or malicious code.  \n- Malware: 0, Security risk: 0, Confidence: 1.  \n- **Score is reasonable.**\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Classification and configuration constants.  \n- Static, no dynamic behavior.  \n- Malware: 0, Security risk: 0, Confidence: 1.  \n- **Score is reasonable.**\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Enumerations for trading system.  \n- No suspicious activity.  \n- Malware: 0, Security risk: 0, Confidence: 0.9.  \n- **Score is reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify that there's no malware. The code is purely static constant definitions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, as there's no obfuscation or confusing code.\n- **Risk score:** Zero, as there's no security vulnerability or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or backdoors detected.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk:** 0 — static constants with no runtime or external data influence.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a benign, well-structured set of constants used for system configuration or enumeration purposes in a financial trading context.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nGiven the comprehensive review, there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is standard for such systems and is safe.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No issues present.  \n- Scores are appropriate.  \n- The code is safe and purely declarative.",
