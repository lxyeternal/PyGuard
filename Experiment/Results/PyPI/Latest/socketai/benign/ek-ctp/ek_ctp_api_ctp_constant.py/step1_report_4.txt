{
  "purpose": "This code defines a large set of constant string mappings used for classification, status codes, and configuration parameters in a financial trading system or API.",
  "sources": "These constants are hardcoded within the source code, serving as lookup tables or enumerations for system states, types, and categories.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic or untrusted data inputs or outputs are evident. The constants are static and used internally; no external data or untrusted inputs are processed or emitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; the code only maps constants to string values without external interaction or data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely consists of static constant definitions with straightforward string mappings; there are no functions, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior indicators are present.",
  "analysis": "The source code contains extensive constant mappings for classification, status, and configuration codes related to a financial trading system. The constants are purely static assignments with no dynamic logic, input/output handling, or cryptographic operations. There is no indication of malicious intent, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure is straightforward, serving as an internal enumeration or configuration setup. No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious activity is evident. The code appears to be a comprehensive set of constants likely used for system operation, validation, or protocol definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static enumeration of constant mappings used in a trading system, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as internal configuration data, with no evidence of malware or malicious activity.",
