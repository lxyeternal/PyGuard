  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as a comprehensive set of constant mappings, likely for configuration or protocol communication.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** All static, no dynamic data, no input/output.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely declarative, serving as enums or configuration constants. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, Obfuscated: 0, Malware: 0, Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** This is a straightforward enumeration definition with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defines constants for statuses, types, categories.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Static constants, no dynamic processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Serves as static configuration; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, Obfuscated: 0, Malware: 0, Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Also benign, standard enum-like constants.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines constants for a trading system API.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Static constant assignments, no data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious constructs or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static, benign enumeration constants, typical for such systems.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, Obfuscated: 0, Malware: 0, Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Constants for classification, status, configuration in a trading system.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Static, no external data or dynamic logic.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static constants, standard enumeration definitions.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, Obfuscated: 0, Malware: 0, Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to others, extensive constant mappings.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Static, no dynamic data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical enum/constants, no malware or security risks.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, Obfuscated: 0, Malware: 0, Security risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is a large set of static constant definitions, serving as enumerations or configuration mappings.\n- **Malware/Malicious Behavior:** None detected in any report. The code does not contain executable logic, dynamic data handling, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present; all constants are straightforward.\n- **Security Risks:** Zero; the code is purely declarative.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nGiven the nature of the code—static constant mappings for a financial trading system—there is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent. The code is typical for defining enums or configuration constants, which are standard in such systems.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk associated with static constants)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, static enumeration set with no signs of malicious or security-compromising behavior. It is typical for a financial trading application's internal constants.",
