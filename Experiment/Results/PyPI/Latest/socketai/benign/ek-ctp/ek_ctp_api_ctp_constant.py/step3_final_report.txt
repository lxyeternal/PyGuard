{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive set of static constants, likely serving as enumerations or configuration mappings for a trading system or protocol. It defines various system states, categories, types, and codes used internally or for communication, with no dynamic input or external data involved.",
  "sources": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments mapping descriptive variable names to string literals. No input, data reading, or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no data flows, output operations, or processing that handle untrusted data. The code is purely declarative, serving as constants.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows exist; the code is a static collection of constants used for internal reference or protocol definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and domain-specific.",
  "analysis": "The code is a large set of static constants representing enums or configuration identifiers for a financial trading system. It contains no functions, dynamic logic, or data processing. The constants are used for statuses, types, categories, and codes, with clear naming conventions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The structure is consistent and typical for such applications. Given the static nature and domain-specific purpose, the code poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static collection of enumeration constants used for configuration or protocol purposes within a trading system. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and appropriate.",
