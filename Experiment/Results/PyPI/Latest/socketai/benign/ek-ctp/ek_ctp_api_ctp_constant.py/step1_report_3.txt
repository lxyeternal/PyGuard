  "purpose": "Definition of constants representing various statuses, types, and codes used in a financial trading system API.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments (e.g., THOST_FTDC_EXP_Normal = '0') defining mappings from descriptive identifiers to string codes.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code solely contains static constant definitions without data handling or input/output operations.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow exists; all are static mappings from identifiers to constant string values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is purely a set of constant mappings without logic.",
  "analysis": "This code consists entirely of constant definitions mapping descriptive names to string codes used in a trading system API. No input, output, or dynamic execution occurs. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The constants are used for status, type, and code mappings, which is standard in such systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, static set of constant definitions for a financial trading API. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. It is likely used for code clarity and consistency across the system.",
