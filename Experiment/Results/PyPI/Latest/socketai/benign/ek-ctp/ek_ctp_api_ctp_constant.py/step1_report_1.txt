{
  "purpose": "This code defines a comprehensive set of constant mappings between string identifiers and their corresponding character codes for a financial trading system, likely used for configuration, data representation, or protocol communication.",
  "sources": "All of the lines are constant definitions assigned to string literals, typically used as configuration or enumerations. No dynamic input or data reading sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform any output operations; all are static constant mappings.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as all variables are fixed constant assignments with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists entirely of static constant definitions with no functions, logic, or data manipulation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The structure and format are straightforward, with no obfuscated or confusing code sections.",
  "analysis": "The code is a large set of static constant mappings that serve as enums or configuration constants within a trading system. There is no evidence of dynamic code execution, external data input, or data leakage. The constants cover various categories such as account types, order types, risk types, message types, and other domain-specific codes. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are identifiable. The code is purely declarative and structured logically.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign collection of constant mappings used for system configuration or protocol definitions within a financial trading application. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The content is static, well-structured, and aligns with typical enum-like definitions.",
