{
  "purpose": "This code defines a large set of constant string mappings for various financial and trading-related enumerations used in a trading system or API.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from hardcoded string assignments, which serve as constant definitions or mappings.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or output; the code solely establishes static constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows or dynamic data processing are present; the code consists of static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extensive but purely declarative, with no signs of obfuscation, code execution, or dynamic behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of numerous constant variable assignments mapping descriptive identifiers to string values, presumably for use as enums or codes within a larger trading system. It is purely static, with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or runtime logic. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a straightforward, comprehensive enumeration definition typical for a financial application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a large, static set of constant mappings for trading system enums, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard for defining constants and does not contain malicious or sabotage elements.",
