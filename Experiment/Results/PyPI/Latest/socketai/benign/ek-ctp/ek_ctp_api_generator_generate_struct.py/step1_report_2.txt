{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate Python struct definitions based on C header file input, transforming C struct declarations into Python dictionary syntax.",
  "sources": "Reads a C header file ('../include/ctp/ThostFtdcUserApiStruct.h') line by line for processing; loads a module dynamically based on the prefix ('ctp_typedef') to get type definitions.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to a new Python file ('ctp_struct.py'); no untrusted data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Reads lines from the header file (source) → processes lines to identify struct declarations and members → writes Python code to output file (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Dynamic import of a module based on the prefix is standard and safe; no obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file parsing and dynamic module import to generate Python code structures. The 'load_constant' method dynamically imports a module named based on the prefix, which could be benign if the module is trusted. The processing functions parse C-style struct definitions into Python dictionaries. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The overall flow is predictable and limited to code generation from a known header file.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility script for converting C struct definitions into Python dictionaries. There is no indication of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The dynamic import is based on a controlled filename, assuming the module is safe and trusted. Overall, the code is low risk.",
