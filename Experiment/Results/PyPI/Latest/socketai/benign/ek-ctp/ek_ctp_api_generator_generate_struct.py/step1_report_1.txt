  "purpose": "This script converts C-style struct definitions into Python dictionary representations, generating a Python file from a header file.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module() to load module dynamically; reading lines from the header file; reading directory listings via dir(module).",
  "sinks": "Writing to output Python file (f_struct); no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Header file lines -> process_line() -> process_declare/process_start/process_end/process_member() -> write to f_struct.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib to dynamically import modules based on filename prefix; no validation or sanitization of filename or prefix. No evidence of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code; the code performs a straightforward conversion task.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports a module named based on input parameters, then processes a header file line-by-line to generate a Python structure file. The dynamic import could be risky if filename or prefix inputs are maliciously crafted, but within the context of controlled usage, it is a standard pattern. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, and no malicious payloads are present. The code's purpose appears benign, converting header structs to Python dict format for further use. It does not perform any harmful actions or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for converting C struct definitions into Python dictionaries. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The only minor concern is the dynamic import based on user-controlled inputs, which could be exploited if inputs are not sanitized. Overall, the script appears safe and purpose-driven.",
