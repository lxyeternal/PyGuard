{
  "purpose": "The script converts C/C++ struct definitions from a header file into a Python dictionary format and writes the output to a Python file.",
  "sources": "Reading the input header file ('../include/ctp/ThostFtdcUserApiStruct.h') line by line.",
  "sinks": "Writing to a new Python file ('ctp_struct.py') and standard output.",
  "flows": "Input file lines are read and processed, then relevant transformed data is written into the output Python file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors observed. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. No network activity or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs structured parsing of a header file to generate a Python representation of C structures. It loads constants from a module named with a prefix, and processes the input line-by-line to generate a new Python file. No input/output streams are used for untrusted data beyond file reading/writing, and there are no suspicious network, cryptographic, or environment variable manipulations. The process appears straightforward and safe, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign struct-to-Python code generator with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It reads a header file, processes C-like structs, and writes corresponding Python code, all in a standard manner.",
