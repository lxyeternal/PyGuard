  "purpose": "Converts C header struct definitions into Python dictionary code by parsing the header file and dynamically importing typedefs.",
  "sources": "Reads lines from the header file, imports a module based on filename prefix to access typedefs.",
  "sinks": "Writes generated Python code to an output file.",
  "flows": "Header file lines -> process_line() -> process_declare/process_member/process_end -> write to output file.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic import of modules based on filename prefix without validation, potential if inputs are malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward parsing and code generation for C structs, with dynamic import based on parameters. No malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The main concern is the dynamic import which could be exploited if inputs are untrusted, but in controlled environments, this pattern is common and safe. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for converting C structs into Python dictionaries. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The only security consideration is input validation for dynamic import to prevent potential exploitation if inputs are malicious. Overall, the code is safe for controlled use.",
