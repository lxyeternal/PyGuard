  "purpose": "Definition of data structures (likely classes or schemas) for various trading, order, account, and market data fields used in a financial trading system.",
  "sources": "Data definitions (schemas) that specify the structure and data types for input and output data related to trading activities, accounts, orders, market data, and system info.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows from untrusted sources into the system, such as user input, network data, or external systems, especially via fields like Password, OTPPassword, AuthCode, and other sensitive credentials.",
  "flows": "Data from user inputs or external systems (e.g., Password, OTPPassword, AuthCode) can flow into processing modules; sensitive fields are likely used for authentication, authorization, or transaction requests; potential flows include credential validation, order submission, and account management.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains numerous fields with sensitive information such as Password, OTPPassword, AuthCode, and other authentication/authorization credentials. These are plain fields with no evident encryption or obfuscation. The inclusion of such data structures is common but warrants careful handling to prevent exposure or misuse. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior detected. The code itself is data schema definitions, not executable logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data structure definitions (field schemas) for a trading system's API or internal processing. It includes various schemas for login, order management, account info, market data, and system operations. The presence of credential-related fields (Password, OTPPassword, AuthCode, etc.) is expected in such systems but requires secure handling outside this schema. There is no executable code, obfuscated logic, or network operations embedded here. No indicators of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The code appears to be standard schema definitions with appropriate data types for a financial trading platform.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of data schema definitions for a trading system's API, containing sensitive fields for user credentials and transaction data. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage evident. The main concern is the sensitive data fields which must be securely managed in actual implementation, but this schema alone does not pose security threats.",
