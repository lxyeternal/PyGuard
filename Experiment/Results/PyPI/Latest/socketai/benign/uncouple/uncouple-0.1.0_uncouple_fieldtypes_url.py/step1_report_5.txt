  "purpose": "Define a custom URL type using Pydantic and yarl for validation and conversion.",
  "sources": "No explicit input reading; relies on Pydantic validation process for data input.",
  "sinks": "Conversion to URL object via lambda function; potential if malicious data is passed, but not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "Input data -> Pydantic validation -> lambda function converting to yarl.URL",
  "anomalies": "Use of AfterValidator with a simple lambda that converts input to string and then to URL. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type annotations and validation tools. Defines a function ToYarlUrl that transforms validated input into a yarl.URL object. The YarlUrl type combines Pydantic's AnyUrl with this custom validator. No input reading, no untrusted data sources within this snippet, and no suspicious code behavior. The conversion function appears straightforward. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected. The code is a simple type alias with custom validation logic for URL handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a utility to enforce URL validation and conversion with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard pattern for data validation in Pydantic models.",
