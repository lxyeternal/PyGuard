  "purpose": "Defines a custom URL type that validates using Pydantic's AnyUrl and converts the validated string into a yarl.URL object.",
  "sources": "Input URL string validated by Pydantic's AnyUrl",
  "sinks": "Conversion to yarl.URL object (no external sinks or data leaks involved)",
  "flows": "Input string -> validated as AnyUrl -> lambda converts to str -> URL(str) -> yarl.URL object",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward lambda function, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries (pydantic, yarl) to create a custom URL type. It validates input URLs and converts them into yarl.URL objects for further use. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The conversion is a simple data transformation, with no network activity or data exfiltration. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to untrusted input handling, which is typical for URL validation. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minor inherent risk due to untrusted input but no actual vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for URL validation and conversion. All reports correctly assess the code as safe with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
