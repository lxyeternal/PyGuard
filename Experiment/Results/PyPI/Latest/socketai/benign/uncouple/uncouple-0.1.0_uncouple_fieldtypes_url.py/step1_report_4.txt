  "purpose": "Define a type alias for a URL that is validated and converted to a yarl.URL object using Pydantic annotations.",
  "sources": "Input data likely comes from user input or external sources when validating data models with Pydantic.",
  "sinks": "Conversion to URL via str(val) in the lambda function; no direct data sinks that pose a risk.",
  "flows": "Input data → lambda function (str conversion) → URL constructor from yarl.",
  "anomalies": "Use of AfterValidator to convert AnyUrl to yarl.URL; the lambda function is straightforward without malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a custom Pydantic validator that converts an AnyUrl type to a yarl.URL object using a lambda function. The lambda simply converts the input to a string and passes it to URL. The code leverages standard libraries and a straightforward approach without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No external data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code appears to be a benign utility for URL validation and conversion.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign URL validation and conversion utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard, safe practices for data validation.",
