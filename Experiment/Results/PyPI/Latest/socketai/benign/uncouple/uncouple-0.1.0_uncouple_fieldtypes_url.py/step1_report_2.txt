{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Pydantic type alias for URLs that are converted into yarl.URL objects after validation.",
  "sources": "Input data that is validated and processed through the lambda function, specifically URL strings provided to the AnyUrl type.",
  "sinks": "The conversion to yarl.URL, which could potentially be used for further URL manipulation or network operations, but only within the code context; no network or file sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input URL string → validated as AnyUrl → lambda function converts string to yarl.URL → stored in ToYarlUrl annotation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of lambda for conversion is straightforward; no obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard Python typing, Pydantic validation, and yarl URL parsing. The lambda function simply converts a string URL into a yarl.URL object after validation. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious data flow. The code appears to be a standard, safe implementation for URL validation and conversion, with no network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal pattern for URL validation and conversion within a Pydantic model, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
