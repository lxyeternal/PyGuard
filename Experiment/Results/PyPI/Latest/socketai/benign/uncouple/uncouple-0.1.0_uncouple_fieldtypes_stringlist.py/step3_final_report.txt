{
  "purpose": "A utility function to accept either a comma-separated string or a list of strings and normalize it into a list for validation.",
  "sources": "Input data processed by the _maybe_split_str function, which reads the initial string or list provided.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows; the code only processes input data without external communication or data leakage.",
  "flows": "Input data (string or list) passes through _maybe_split_str, resulting in a list used by Pydantic validation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard error handling and no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple normalization utility that splits strings on commas or returns lists unchanged. It raises ValueError on invalid types. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure operations are present. The logic is clear, and the implementation aligns with common practices for input preprocessing. No external calls, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured input normalization utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
