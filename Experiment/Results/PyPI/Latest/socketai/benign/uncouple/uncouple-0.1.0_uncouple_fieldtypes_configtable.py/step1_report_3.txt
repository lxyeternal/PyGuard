  "purpose": "Define a function that creates a configuration table mapping for a given Config class, with optional key prefixing.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'config_class', 'prefix'; Data inside '_configtable' from the 'data' dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Use of 'config_class.load()' which may process data; potential injection if 'data' contains malicious or malformed input.",
  "flows": "Input 'data' flows into '_configtable' where 'config_class.load()' is called for each item, potentially processing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'load' method on 'config_class' without validation shown; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected; no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a factory function that returns an Annotated type with a validator that transforms a dictionary into a mapping of Config objects, optionally prefixing keys. The '_configtable' function constructs a new dictionary by calling 'load' on each item, which could be risky if 'data' contains malicious or malformed entries. The use of 'BeforeValidator' ensures the transformation occurs before validation. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, no hidden backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code primarily deals with configuration management and data transformation, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration utility for managing configuration objects, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It relies on the 'load' method of the provided Config class, which should be assumed safe unless 'load' is maliciously implemented, but there is no evidence of that here.",
