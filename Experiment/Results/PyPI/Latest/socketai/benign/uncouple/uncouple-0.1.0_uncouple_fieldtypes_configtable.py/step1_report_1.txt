{
  "purpose": "This code defines a function to create a configuration table from a dictionary, with support for prefixing keys and loading Config objects.",
  "sources": "Input dictionary 'data' passed to the '_configtable' function, and parameters 'config_class' and 'prefix'.",
  "sinks": "The 'config_class.load' method which might process data, and the returned annotated type that could be used in validation pipelines.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'data' into '_configtable', where each item is processed with 'config_class.load', producing a dictionary mapping names to Config objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as hardcoded credentials, network access, or obfuscated code. The use of 'load' method is standard, but depends on implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a function 'ConfigTable' that returns an Annotated type with a 'BeforeValidator'. The inner function '_configtable' transforms a dictionary of data into a dictionary of 'Config' objects, each loaded with a prefix. The use of 'config_class.load' suggests standard configuration object creation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious operations. The code appears straightforward and adheres to typical patterns for configuration handling. No external data sources or insecure operations are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration utility without malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
