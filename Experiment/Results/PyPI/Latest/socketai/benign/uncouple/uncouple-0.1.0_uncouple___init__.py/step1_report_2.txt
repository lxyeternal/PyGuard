  "purpose": "Import statements for various modules and classes, likely for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No direct data input sources; imports modules from the same package and submodules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in these import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing logic present; only module imports.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any code that executes logic, data handling, or potentially suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with no executable logic, data processing, or data flow. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The imports appear standard for a modular Python project. No hardcoded secrets, code injection, or obfuscated code is present. The code's structure is typical and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple set of import statements with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It appears to be part of a larger, benign codebase.",
