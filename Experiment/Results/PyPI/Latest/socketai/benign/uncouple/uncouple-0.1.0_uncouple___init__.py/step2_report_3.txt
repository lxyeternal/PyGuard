  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as only consisting of import statements from internal modules.\n- No data processing, external communication, or dynamic execution is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks are identified.\n- The code snippets are standard for Python packages, mainly for setup or configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Specific analysis per report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is just import statements, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No data flow or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No dynamic code or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1.0, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The use of `# noqa: F401` indicates suppression of unused import warnings, which is common and benign.\n- **Scores:** confidence=0.9 (slightly less, but still high), obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that these are just import statements with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Malware and obfuscated scores:** Correctly set to 0, as there's no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0 or very close to 0, reflecting no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the nature of the code (simple import statements) and the reports' conclusions, I agree with the provided scores and reasoning. There are no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary note:** The reports are thorough and accurate. No further action or concern is warranted based on these snippets.",
