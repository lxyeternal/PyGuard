  "purpose": "Import statements for various configuration and field type modules within a package.",
  "sources": "Module imports, which load code from other parts of the package.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows, as the code only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The use of noqa suggests intentional suppression of linter warnings, but not malicious. No unusual code or logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of import statements, importing several modules related to configuration and data types. No external network calls, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present. The suppression of linter warning (noqa) is a common practice to ignore unused imports or linter warnings and is not indicative of malicious activity. The imported modules themselves could potentially be scrutinized, but based solely on these import statements, no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple module imports with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is a standard pattern in Python packages to organize and import internal modules. No security risks or malware are detected in this fragment.",
