  "purpose": "This code imports various modules and classes related to configuration and data types for a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading modules and classes from local package files",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; imports are static and do not process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed; no obfuscated code or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules. There are no data processing, input handling, or output functions. No signs of malicious or suspicious activity such as network calls, dynamic code execution, or data leaks. The structure is straightforward and standard for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard import block with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply prepares the package by importing necessary components.",
