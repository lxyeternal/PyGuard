  "purpose": "Import statements for various modules and classes within a package, likely for configuration and data handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading from local modules and submodules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; only module imports present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns detected. The comments indicate ignoring unused imports for linting purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing classes from internal modules. There are no runtime behaviors, no data processing, and no external data sources or sinks. The import list includes configuration and field type modules, suggesting typical package structure. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious activity, or security risks within these import statements. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or insecure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of import statements from internal modules, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger codebase's setup or initialization phase.",
