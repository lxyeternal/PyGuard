  "purpose": "This code snippet consists solely of import statements from internal modules, serving to include various configuration and data type classes into the current module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or data sources; it only imports internal modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code does not perform any data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static import statements with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present; the code is straightforward and standard for module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements, with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify this as benign. The scores assigned—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0—are appropriate given the absence of any malicious or risky behavior. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is simple and well-understood. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign set of internal module imports with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
