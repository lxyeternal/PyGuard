  "conclusion": "The code is a standard YAML loader with validation hooks, free of malicious behavior. The reports lack detail, so no security issues can be confirmed. The main concern is a type mismatch and shared state usage, which can be improved. Scores should be set to zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low risk score, reflecting the benign nature of the code."
