  "purpose": "Provides a YAML loading utility with validation hooks for data integrity.",
  "sources": "Reads text from a file path specified by the user.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted YAML content loaded from files; no direct data sinks in code.",
  "flows": "read_yaml reads file content -> returns raw data -> wrap_data wraps into LoadedData object.",
  "anomalies": "The read_yaml method returns raw data instead of a LoadedData instance, conflicting with type annotations; self.path is stored as state and used later, which can cause issues if called concurrently.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward YAML loader with validation hooks. It uses safe_load, mitigating many YAML injection risks. However, the method returns raw data instead of a LoadedData object, which conflicts with the annotated type. The self.path attribute is overwritten each time read_yaml is called, risking race conditions in concurrent environments. The reports indicate 'Empty response' with no details, making it impossible to verify actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity. Overall, the code is benign, with minor logical issues, and no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard YAML loader with validation hooks, free of malicious behavior. The reports lack detail, so no security issues can be confirmed. The main concern is a type mismatch and shared state usage, which can be improved. Scores should be set to zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low risk score, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
