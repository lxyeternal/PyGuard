{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load and manage configuration parameters from environment variables and a repository, including nested configurations, using environment variable keys with optional prefixes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables via os.environ, decouple's configuration repository (config.config.repository.data), and function parameters for defaults.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data that could lead to data leaks or code execution are present. The code primarily reads environment variables and configuration data, then structures it into nested dictionaries.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or decouple config data -> `_gen_loaded_items()` yields key-value pairs -> `_nested_dict()` constructs nested dictionaries -> `load()` creates a Config instance with these values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. Usage of `print()` statements for debugging purposes could be considered unnecessary but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script loads configuration settings from environment variables and a decouple repository, handling nested configurations via recursive inspection of a Config class. It uses inspect.signature to analyze constructor parameters and generate keys accordingly. The data flow is straightforward: environmental sources -> internal processing -> instantiation. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious actions are detected. The use of `print()` for debugging could be a minor concern but is not malicious. All library usage appears legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration loader with nested support, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any unsafe operations or interact with external systems beyond reading environment variables and configuration data.",
