  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code against the described issues, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a configuration loader that uses environment variables and decouple's configuration data.\n- It employs dynamic inspection (`inspect.signature`) and constructs nested dictionaries.\n- There are multiple `print()` statements used for debugging purposes.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior is detected.\n- The main concern is the `print()` statement that could leak sensitive info if environment variables contain secrets.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identified.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes the `print()` statement, which could leak secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code, just a debug print statement.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (minor, due to info leak potential)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. The risk is low, but the print statement warrants a slight concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behaviors, only debug print.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard configuration loader, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. The report correctly identifies the debug print as a minor concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Same concern about print statements.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code, just debug info.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Debug print statement noted.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; only debug info.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Debug print statement.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code; just a potential info leak.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, no obfuscation evident.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0.2 in all reports, consistent with the potential info leak via print statements.\n\n**Note:** The main security concern is the debug print statement. While not malicious, in a security context, it could expose secrets if environment variables contain sensitive data.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimation**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and understandable.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — minor, due to debug print statement that could leak secrets if logs are insecure.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior. The only recommendation is to remove or disable debug print statements in production to prevent potential secret leaks.",
