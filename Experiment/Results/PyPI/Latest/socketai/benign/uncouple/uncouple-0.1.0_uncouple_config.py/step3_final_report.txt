  "purpose": "Configuration loader that reads environment variables and decouple data to instantiate a typed Config object.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ), decouple's configuration repository data",
  "sinks": "Debug print statement within _gen_loaded_items function",
  "flows": "Environment variables / decouple data -> inspect.signature parameters -> print() debug output",
  "anomalies": "Presence of print() statements used for debugging, potential leakage of sensitive info if secrets are stored in environment variables",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads configuration parameters from environment variables and decouple's data, constructing nested dictionaries for configuration. It uses inspect.signature to iterate over parameters and fetches values via decouple's config function. The debug print statements output parameter names, types, and keys during iteration, which could leak secrets if environment variables contain sensitive data. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The overall structure is straightforward and intended for flexible configuration loading. The main concern is the debug print statement, which should be removed or replaced with proper logging at an appropriate level for production. The code does not perform any malicious actions or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration loader with no malicious intent. The only security concern is the debug print statement, which could leak secrets if environment variables contain sensitive data. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score of 0.2 is appropriate due to the debug statement. Removing or disabling debug prints in production is recommended.",
