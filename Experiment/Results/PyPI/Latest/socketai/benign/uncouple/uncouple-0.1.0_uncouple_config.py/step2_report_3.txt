  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the presence of issues, the appropriateness of scores, and any security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious code or backdoors detected. The only concern is the `print()` statement used for debugging, which could leak sensitive data if environment variables contain secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These seem reasonable given the analysis.\n- **Justification for risk score:** The risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, as the debug print could leak secrets but does not introduce a direct security threat.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, just a debug statement that should be removed in production.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious code. The code loads configuration data securely and properly constructs nested dictionaries.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Justification for risk score:** No malicious behavior, only debug print statements, which are minor concerns.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard configuration loader, no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above. No malicious activity. The debug print statement is the only concern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Justification for risk score:** No active security threat.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate configuration loader, minor debug concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious code detected. The print statement could leak secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Justification for risk score:** Same as above, minor concern.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard configuration utility, no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious activity. The code loads environment variables and configuration data securely.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Justification for risk score:** No active threat; debug print is a minor concern.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Typical configuration management code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code functions as a configuration loader, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Debug print statement:** Present in all reports, potentially leaking secrets if environment variables contain sensitive data. This is a security concern but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** The 0.2 score is appropriate, considering the debug print statement could leak secrets but does not pose an active security threat.\n- **Additional note:** For production, the debug print statement should be removed or replaced with proper logging that masks sensitive info.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\nThe code is a standard configuration loader with no malware or malicious intent. The only minor concern is the debug print statement, which could lead to secret leaks if environment variables contain sensitive data. The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (due to debug print statement)\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is safe, with a minor best practice recommendation to remove debug print statements before deploying in production environments.",
