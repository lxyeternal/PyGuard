  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The code is a straightforward configuration loader. No malicious behavior or code injection detected.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  The only concern is the debug `print()` statement, which could leak sensitive info if environment variables contain secrets. This is a common development oversight but not a security breach.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (low, due to debug print)  \n  These seem reasonable.\n\n- **Justification for Risk Score > 0.5?**  \n  Not applicable; score is 0.2, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No malicious code detected. The code loads configs from environment and decouple data.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  The print statement for debugging again, which could leak secrets.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (appropriate)  \n  These scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. Standard configuration loading with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  Same debug print statement concern.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2  \n  These are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No malicious activity. The code is a typical configuration loader.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  Debug print statement, potential info leak.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2  \n  These are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. Standard config loading pattern, no malicious code.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  Debug print statement again, which could leak secrets.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2  \n  These are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity or code injection detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated at 0.2 due to debug print statements that could leak sensitive info if logs are not secured. This is a minor security concern but not a significant risk.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent across reports.\n- The only notable issue is the debug print statement, which should be removed or replaced with proper logging at appropriate levels for production.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to debug statements potentially exposing secrets)\n\nThis code is a standard configuration loader with no malicious intent. The only security concern is the debug print statement, which is a common oversight but not a malicious feature.",
