  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration loader with no malicious intent. The only security concern is the debug print statement, which could leak secrets if environment variables contain sensitive data. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score of 0.2 is appropriate due to the debug statement. Removing or disabling debug prints in production is recommended."
