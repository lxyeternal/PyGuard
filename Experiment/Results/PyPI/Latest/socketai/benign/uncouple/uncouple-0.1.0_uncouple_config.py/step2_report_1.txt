  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code loads configuration from environment variables and decouple data, with a debug print statement that could leak secrets.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — minor concern due to debug logs.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The print statement is a potential info leak but not malicious. The code functions as intended.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard configuration loading with no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity, only debug print statements.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a typical configuration loader with no signs of malicious intent. Debug print statements noted.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; no malware.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern, debug print statement as the only concern.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion—standard configuration loader, debug statements present.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Code presence of malware:** No, all reports assign malware score 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All are low (0.2), justified by debug print statements that could leak secrets but do not cause harm.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code or backdoors detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and understandable.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the debug print statements, a slight risk exists if logs are exposed, but overall, the code does not pose a security threat.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Remove or disable debug print statements in production to prevent potential secret leaks.\n- No other security concerns are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard configuration management utility with no malicious intent or behaviors. The only concern is the debug print statement, which should be cleaned up for production use. The current scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final scores I recommend:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with reports)\n\n**Note:** No further action needed unless the print statements are left in production, which could be a minor security concern.",
