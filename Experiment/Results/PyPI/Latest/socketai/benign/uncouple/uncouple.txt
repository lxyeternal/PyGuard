The only security concern is the debug print statement, which could leak secrets if environment variables contain sensitive data. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score of 0.2 is appropriate due to the debug statement. Removing or disabling debug prints in production is recommended."

The only issue is a minor typo that should be corrected for proper functionality but does not impact security. Malware score is 0, security risk is 0, and confidence is high."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard YAML loader with validation hooks, free of malicious behavior. The reports lack detail, so no security issues can be confirmed. The main concern is a type mismatch and shared state usage, which can be improved. Scores should be set to zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low risk score, reflecting the benign nature of the code."
