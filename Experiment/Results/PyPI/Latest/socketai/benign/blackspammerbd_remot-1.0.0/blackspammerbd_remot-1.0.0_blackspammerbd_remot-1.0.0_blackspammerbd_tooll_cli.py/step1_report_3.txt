  "purpose": "The script provides a CLI tool for secure device connection and file transfer, including server and client modes with authentication using secret codes.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user inputs (via command line and prompts), network data received through socket connections, and file reads for uploading files.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets for sending and receiving data, file writes (upload/download), and console output for user interaction.",
  "flows": "User inputs (secret code, commands) are sent over sockets for authentication and file transfer; network data received from sockets are decoded and saved to files; secret code is generated and saved locally; socket data flows from network to application and vice versa.",
  "anomalies": "The code generates secret codes using the 'random' module without cryptographic strength, which may be predictable. The secret code is stored in a plain text file with permissions set to owner-only. No encryption or secure storage of secrets. The code facilitates remote file transfer, which could be exploited if unauthorized access occurs. No explicit input validation or sanitization is performed on filenames received over the network, which could lead to directory traversal if used maliciously. The code includes comments and prompts in Bengali, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic TCP server-client architecture with authentication via a randomly generated secret code stored in a local file. The server authenticates clients by comparing received codes. Both server and client support commands for listing files, uploading, and downloading files, with base64 encoding for data transfer. There are no evident backdoors, code injection points, or malicious commands. The use of 'random' for secret code generation is predictable but not directly malicious. Files are read and written without additional security checks, but no code suggests malicious intent such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or hidden backdoors. The network communication and file handling are straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious code structures. The overall logic aims to facilitate remote file transfer with authentication, without exploiting or harming the system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool for secure connection and file transfer with simple authentication. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. However, its reliance on predictable random codes and lack of encrypted storage or secure input validation could pose security risks in practical deployment. Based on the current analysis, the package appears benign with low malicious potential.",
