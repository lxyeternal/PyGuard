  "purpose": "Package setup configuration for 'blackspammerbd_remot', defining metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, dependencies, and entry point declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or input handling; no runtime data flows within this script.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; only static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools, with no embedded executable code, dynamic input, or network activity. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only external invocation is in the entry point 'blackspammerbd_remot.cli:main', which is outside the scope of this script. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscated as 0, and security risk as 0, consistent with the code's straightforward nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are present within this setup script. The actual security posture depends on the implementation of the CLI module, which is not provided here.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious code. Scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed based solely on this code. Further security assessment should include the implementation of 'cli:main' and other package contents.",
