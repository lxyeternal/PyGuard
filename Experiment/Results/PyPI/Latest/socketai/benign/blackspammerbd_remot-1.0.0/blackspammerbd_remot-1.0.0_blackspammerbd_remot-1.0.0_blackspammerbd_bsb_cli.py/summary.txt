  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, insecure file transfer utility that does not contain malware or obfuscation. Its security flaws stem from poor cryptographic practices and lack of encryption, but it does not perform any malicious actions. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.3 to 0.4 due to these vulnerabilities. The assessments across reports are accurate and consistent."
