  "purpose": "Provides CLI commands for generating/storing a secret code, starting a TCP server, and connecting as a client for file transfer with authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads input from socket connections, reads/writes files, reads user input for commands.",
  "sinks": "Socket send/recv functions, file read/write operations, console input/output.",
  "flows": "Secret code loaded from file -> client/server authentication -> command processing -> file transfer or control commands.",
  "anomalies": "Uses `random.randint()` for secret code generation (predictable), stores secret code in plain text, no encryption or validation of filenames, no sanitization, no secure communication protocols.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple TCP-based file transfer with shared secret authentication. It lacks cryptographic security, relying on a predictable numeric code generated via `random.randint()`. The secret code is stored in a plain text file with permissions 600, which is insecure. Data transfer is unencrypted, base64 encoding is used only for file content, and filenames are not validated, risking path traversal. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The security weaknesses are consistent with insecure implementation practices rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, insecure file transfer utility that does not contain malware or obfuscation. Its security flaws stem from poor cryptographic practices and lack of encryption, but it does not perform any malicious actions. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.3 to 0.4 due to these vulnerabilities. The assessments across reports are accurate and consistent.",
