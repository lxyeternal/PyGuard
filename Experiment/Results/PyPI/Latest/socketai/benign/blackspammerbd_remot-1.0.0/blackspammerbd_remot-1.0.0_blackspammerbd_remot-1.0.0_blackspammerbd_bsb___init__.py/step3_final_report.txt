  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows; the code is purely a comment with no operational code.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, only a comment; no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comment indicating package initialization with no actual code, data handling, or suspicious activity. All reports correctly identify the lack of executable content and malicious behavior. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero. Confidence levels are low to moderate due to the minimal content, but overall, the benign nature is clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only a comment with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
