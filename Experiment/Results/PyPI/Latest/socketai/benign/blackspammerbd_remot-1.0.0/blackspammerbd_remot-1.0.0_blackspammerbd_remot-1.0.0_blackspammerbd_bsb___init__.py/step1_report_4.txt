  "analysis": "The provided code snippet contains only a comment indicating package initialization without any executable code, functions, or data handling. Without actual code, there are no sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. The minimal content makes it impossible to identify malicious behavior or security risks. Based solely on this, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is just a comment with no executable logic, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks identified. More code is needed for a comprehensive review.",
