  "purpose": "This code snippet is a package initialization comment with no executable code or data handling.",
  "sources": "None; the snippet contains only a comment.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists due to lack of code.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code; only a comment present; package name 'blackspammerbd_v1' could be suspicious but is not evidence of malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet is solely a comment indicating package initialization, with no functions, data flows, or suspicious code. All reports correctly identify the absence of executable content and malicious behavior. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. The security risk score is minimal, justified by the lack of code; the package name alone does not constitute evidence of malicious intent. Confidence levels are high given the minimal content. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only a comment with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The package name alone does not justify increased risk scores. Overall, the snippet poses no security concern.",
