  "purpose": "Import a class named BlackSpammerBD from a local module named core.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module '.core' during import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads code from a local module; no data flow or execution flow to external sources or sinks evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement. No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward import statement importing a class from a local module. No code execution, no input handling, no data leakage, and no external network activity indicated. The class name 'BlackSpammerBD' could suggest malicious intent based solely on the name, but the code itself does not contain any logic or behavior. The code appears to be part of a larger project, and without additional context, no malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The class name alone does not indicate malicious intent in the code's current form.",
