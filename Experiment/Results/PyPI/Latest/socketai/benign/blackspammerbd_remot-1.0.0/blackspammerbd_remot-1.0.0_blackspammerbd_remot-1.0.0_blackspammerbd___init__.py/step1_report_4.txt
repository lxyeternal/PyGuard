  "purpose": "Import the class BlackSpammerBD from a local module named core.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which loads a class definition from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow beyond import; no source-to-sink pathways are visible.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs; the import is relative, which could be a concern if used maliciously, but on its own it's standard practice.",
  "analysis": "This code is a straightforward import statement importing a class named BlackSpammerBD from a local module core. There are no data inputs, no execution logic, and no obvious signs of malicious intent. As this is only an import statement, it does not perform any actions that could be malicious. Without additional context or code, there's no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears benign but provides minimal context for further analysis.",
