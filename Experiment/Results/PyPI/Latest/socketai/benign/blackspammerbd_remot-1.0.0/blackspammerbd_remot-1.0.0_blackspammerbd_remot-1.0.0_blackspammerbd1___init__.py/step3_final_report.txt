  "purpose": "A comment-only package initializer with no executable code.",
  "sources": "No sources; only a comment line indicating package initialization.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; absence of data handling or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows; no executable code or data movement present.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only a comment; no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains solely a comment indicating the package initializer, with no executable statements, imports, or data handling. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Malware scores are zero, consistent with no malicious activity. Security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature of the snippet. The minimalism could be a placeholder but does not imply malicious intent. The scores and reasoning are consistent across all reports, and no further action is necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet is benign, serving as a placeholder comment with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
