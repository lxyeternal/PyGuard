  "purpose": "This script provides a CLI utility for generating, verifying, listing, encoding, and decoding files, primarily for managing connection codes and file transformations.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command-line arguments, reads and writes files ('connection_code.txt', target files for encoding/decoding).",
  "sinks": "File read/write operations, console output for status messages.",
  "flows": "User inputs command and parameters -> code executes corresponding function -> reads/writes files or outputs to console.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'random.randint()' for connection code generation (not cryptographically secure), no filename validation (potential path traversal), no input sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility with standard library usage, no obfuscation, and no malicious code. It generates an 8-digit code using weak randomness, which is acceptable for non-sensitive identification but not secure. File operations are basic; no network activity or dynamic code execution is present. The lack of filename validation could pose security risks in certain contexts but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the script is benign, with minor security considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for file encoding/decoding and connection code management. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The primary security concern is the use of weak randomness and lack of filename validation, which are standard issues in such utilities but do not imply malicious intent.",
