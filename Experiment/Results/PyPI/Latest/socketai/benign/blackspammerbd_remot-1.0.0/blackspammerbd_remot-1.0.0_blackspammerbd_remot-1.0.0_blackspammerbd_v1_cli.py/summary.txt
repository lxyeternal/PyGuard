  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for file encoding/decoding and connection code management. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The primary security concern is the use of weak randomness and lack of filename validation, which are standard issues in such utilities but do not imply malicious intent."
