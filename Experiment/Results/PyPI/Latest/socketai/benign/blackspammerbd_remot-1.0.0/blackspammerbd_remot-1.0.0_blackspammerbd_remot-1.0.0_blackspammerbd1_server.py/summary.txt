  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, functional file management server with no embedded malware or obfuscation. Its main vulnerability is the lack of security controls, making it susceptible to misuse if exposed publicly. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.6, reflecting moderate risk due to exposure and lack of access restrictions."
