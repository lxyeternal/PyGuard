Its security flaws stem from poor cryptographic practices and lack of encryption, but it does not perform any malicious actions. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.3 to 0.4 due to these vulnerabilities. The assessments across reports are accurate and consistent."

The primary security concern is the use of weak randomness and lack of filename validation, which are standard issues in such utilities but do not imply malicious intent."
