  "purpose": "A web application for uploading a sitemap XML file and analyzing it for SEO purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads uploaded file content via st.file_uploader; reads current working directory for saving files",
  "sinks": "Writing uploaded file to disk; passing file path to analyze_sitemap function; outputting DataFrame; creating download button",
  "flows": "File upload -> saving file -> analyze_sitemap function -> display results -> provide download",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code behaviors observed. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Streamlit app allowing file uploads, saving the file locally, and calling an external analysis function. It handles user input securely via the file uploader widget. There are no signs of malicious payloads, code injection, or suspicious behavior. The analyze_sitemap function's implementation is not provided, so its security cannot be assessed here, but assuming it is a benign analysis function, the overall code appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate web app for sitemap analysis with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It safely handles file upload and output display, assuming the external analyze_sitemap function is secure.",
