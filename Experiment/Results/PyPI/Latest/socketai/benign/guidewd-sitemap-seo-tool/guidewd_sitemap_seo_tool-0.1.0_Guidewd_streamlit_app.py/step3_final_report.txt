  "purpose": "A web application for uploading a sitemap XML file, saving it locally, analyzing it via an external function, and displaying the results.",
  "sources": "File upload widget (`st.file_uploader`), reading the uploaded file (`sitemap_file.getbuffer()`), saving to disk (`open()`), passing file path to `analyze_sitemap()`.",
  "sinks": "External analysis function (`analyze_sitemap`), display of results (`st.dataframe`), download button for CSV.",
  "flows": "User uploads file -> file saved locally -> file path passed to analysis function -> results displayed and downloadable.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or obfuscation. The uploaded file is saved directly without validation, which is typical but could be a minor concern in untrusted environments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation for uploading and analyzing sitemaps. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The external `analyze_sitemap` function's security depends on its implementation, but the code itself is benign. The file handling could be improved with validation, but this does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, reflecting minimal risk due to basic file handling. Overall, the code appears safe and suitable for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard web app component for sitemap analysis with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior, assuming the external analysis function is secure.",
