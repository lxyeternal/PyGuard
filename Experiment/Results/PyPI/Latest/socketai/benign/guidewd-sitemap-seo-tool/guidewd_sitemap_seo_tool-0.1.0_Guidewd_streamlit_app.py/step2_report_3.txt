  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward web app for uploading and analyzing sitemaps.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The external function `analyze_sitemap` is not provided, so its security cannot be directly assessed. However, the reports assume it is benign.\n- The code uses standard libraries and practices, with no signs of backdoors, network exfiltration, or malicious payloads.\n- The security risk scores are consistently low (around 0.1-0.2), which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No, the code appears correct and secure based on the provided snippet.\n\n- **Malware presence?**  \n  No, the code does not contain malware or malicious intent.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No, the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  The only potential concern is the lack of input validation or sanitization when saving files, but given the context, this is typical and not necessarily a vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code relies on an external analysis function, which could be a risk if malicious, but this is outside the scope of the code itself.\n- No mention of validation or sanitization of uploaded files is noted, which could be a concern in a real-world scenario, but it doesn't imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Slight variation (0.1-0.2). Given the benign nature, these are reasonable. The only concern is the lack of validation, but that alone doesn't elevate the risk significantly.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's analysis.\n- If anything, the security risk could be marginally increased if considering the lack of input validation, but given the context, a score of 0.2 remains appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated security risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard implementation for uploading and analyzing sitemaps. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The external analysis function's trustworthiness is assumed, which is common in such assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe provided reports are accurate and thorough. The code is safe, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scoring aligns well with the code's nature.",
