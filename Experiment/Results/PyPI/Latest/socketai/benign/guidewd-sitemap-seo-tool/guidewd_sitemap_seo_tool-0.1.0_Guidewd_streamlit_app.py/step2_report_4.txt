  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is a straightforward web app for uploading and analyzing sitemaps, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code solely handles file upload, saving, and invoking an external analysis function.\n\n2. **Code Logic and Flow:**  \n   The code reads user-uploaded files via `st.file_uploader`, saves the file locally with `open()`, and calls `analyze_sitemap()` with the saved file path. It then displays results and offers a download.  \n   No suspicious or malicious operations are evident—no network calls beyond the analysis function, no data exfiltration, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials.\n\n3. **External Analysis Function:**  \n   The security of the overall system depends on `analyze_sitemap`. Since its implementation isn't provided, the assumption is that it is benign. The code itself doesn't execute or process data beyond file handling.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Anomalies:**  \n   - Saving uploaded files directly to the current working directory could pose risks if the environment isn't properly sandboxed, but this is common in such applications.\n   - No input validation or sanitization is performed on the uploaded file, but given the context (sitemap XML), this is typical.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.\n\n5. **Scores and Justification:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal risk. Given the lack of malicious activity, a score of 0.1 seems more appropriate.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**  \n   The code appears safe, with no evidence of malicious intent. The external analysis function is a potential vector if malicious, but since it's external and not shown, the code itself remains benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** (slightly above zero due to file handling, but minimal)\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a standard, benign web app component for sitemap analysis. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The overall security posture is very good, assuming the external `analyze_sitemap` function is secure and trusted.\n\n**Note:** If the `analyze_sitemap` function is untrusted or unknown, the risk could increase, but based solely on this code snippet, the risk remains minimal.",
