{
  "purpose": "This script provides a web interface for uploading a sitemap XML file and analyzing its SEO properties using an external analysis function.",
  "sources": "The code reads user-uploaded files via st.file_uploader, and uses os.getcwd() to determine file storage path.",
  "sinks": "File writing with open(upload_path, 'wb'), reading from the uploaded file buffer, and calling analyze_sitemap with the file path.",
  "flows": "User uploads file -> file is saved locally -> analyze_sitemap is called with the file path -> results are displayed and available for download.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual or suspicious function calls. Usage of os.getcwd() is standard for file handling.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Streamlit app for uploading and analyzing sitemaps. It imports standard libraries and a custom analysis module. Uploaded files are saved directly to the current working directory without additional validation or sanitization, but this is typical for such applications. The analysis function is external and not provided here, so its content is unknown, but the script itself does not contain any malicious behavior or malicious code. No evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. The code structure is straightforward and aligns with common web app patterns. No obfuscated code or suspicious flow is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign, standard web application component for uploading and analyzing sitemaps. It does not contain malware or malicious intent based on the provided code.",
