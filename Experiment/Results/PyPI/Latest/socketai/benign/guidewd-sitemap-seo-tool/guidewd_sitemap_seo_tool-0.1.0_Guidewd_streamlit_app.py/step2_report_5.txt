  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring and conclusions.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a simple Streamlit app for uploading a sitemap XML file, saving it locally, and passing it to an external analysis function.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded credentials are present.\n- The external function `analyze_sitemap` is not provided, so its security implications depend on its implementation.\n- The code handles user input securely via the file uploader widget.\n- File saving is straightforward, with no evident security flaws in this context.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are detected within the provided code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly implements a file upload, save, analyze, and display flow.\n- **Malware presence:** Based solely on this code, there is no malware.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** Minimal, assuming `analyze_sitemap` is secure.\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n- All reports uniformly describe the code as a standard, benign web app for sitemap analysis.\n- They agree on the absence of suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The only caveat is the external `analyze_sitemap` function, which could introduce risks if malicious, but that is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent.\n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which is reasonable given the minimal handling of user input and external dependencies.\n- **Confidence levels:** High (around 0.9-0.95), justified by the straightforward code.\n\n### Justifications for risk scores:\n- The code itself is benign; the risk depends on the external `analyze_sitemap` implementation.\n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- File handling is standard, with no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n**Should remain at 0.0** — no evidence of malicious code.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n**Should remain at 0.0** — no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n**Should be around 0.1-0.2** — minimal risk, assuming external analysis function is benign.\n\n**Malware justification:**  \nNo malware behavior is present or implied within this code snippet.\n\n**Obfuscation justification:**  \nCode is straightforward and transparent.\n\n**Security risk justification:**  \nMinimal, primarily related to the external analysis function and file handling, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Recommended Score | Justification                                                  |\n|------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0.0                       | No malicious activity detected in the code.                     |\n| Obfuscated       | 0.0                       | Code is clear, straightforward, no obfuscation.                |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1 - 0.2                 | Very low; depends on external function, but no issues here.   |\n\n**Note:** The overall security posture is very good, assuming the external `analyze_sitemap` is secure and trusted.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nGiven the evidence, I see no reason to assign higher scores. The code appears safe, benign, and well-structured.",
