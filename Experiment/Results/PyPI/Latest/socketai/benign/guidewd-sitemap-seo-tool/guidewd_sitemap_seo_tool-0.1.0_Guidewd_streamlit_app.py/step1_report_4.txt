  "purpose": "Web application for uploading a sitemap XML file and analyzing it for SEO purposes using an external analysis function.",
  "sources": "Reading the uploaded file via st.file_uploader(), saving it to disk with open() and write(), passing file path to analyze_sitemap function.",
  "sinks": "Saving the uploaded file to the server's filesystem, invoking analyze_sitemap with a local file path, generating a CSV for download.",
  "flows": "File upload -> Save to disk -> analyze_sitemap() function call with file path -> display results and provide download link.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external network calls, no unusual code patterns or obfuscated code. Use of external analysis function appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code allows users to upload an XML sitemap file, which is saved locally and then analyzed by an external function. The process involves reading user input, writing to the filesystem, and invoking a function with a file path. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors. The only external interaction is with the analyze_sitemap function, which is assumed to be benign as it is imported and called directly. The code appears to be a typical file upload and processing pipeline for a web app, with no suspicious or malicious activities detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard web app component for uploading and analyzing sitemaps. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. There are no security risks beyond typical file upload handling, which should be managed securely in production. Overall, it appears safe.",
