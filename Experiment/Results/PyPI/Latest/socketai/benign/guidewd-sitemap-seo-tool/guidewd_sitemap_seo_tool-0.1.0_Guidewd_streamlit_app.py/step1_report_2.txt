  "purpose": "A web application for uploading and analyzing sitemap XML files for SEO purposes.",
  "sources": "st.file_uploader (file upload input), os.path.join (constructing file path), sitemap_file.getbuffer() (reading uploaded file data), analyze_sitemap (processing the uploaded file), result_df.to_csv (converting analysis results to CSV)",
  "sinks": "writing uploaded file to disk (open/write), analyze_sitemap function call (potentially executing code based on uploaded data), st.download_button (serving analysis results for download)",
  "flows": "sitemap_file -> getbuffer() -> write to 'uploaded_sitemap.xml' -> analyze_sitemap('uploaded_sitemap.xml') -> result_df -> to_csv() -> st.download_button",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code performs standard file upload, save, analysis, and download functions. The analysis function is imported from an external module and is not shown, so cannot assess its security. No obfuscation or malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Streamlit application that accepts a user-uploaded XML file, saves it locally, and passes it to an analysis function. It then displays and provides the results for download. All operations appear standard for a web app, with no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or code execution beyond file handling. The use of external analysis function means potential risk depends on its implementation, but within this code snippet, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a simple, legitimate sitemap analysis web interface. There are no indicators of malicious intent or malware within this code. Security risks are minimal, assuming the analyze_sitemap function is secure and trusted. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
