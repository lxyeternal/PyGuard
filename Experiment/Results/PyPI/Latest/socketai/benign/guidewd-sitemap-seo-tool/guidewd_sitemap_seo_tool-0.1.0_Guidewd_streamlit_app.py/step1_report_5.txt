  "purpose": "A web application for uploading a sitemap XML file and analyzing it for SEO purposes.",
  "sources": "The uploaded file via st.file_uploader; the file buffer via sitemap_file.getbuffer()",
  "sinks": "Writing the uploaded file to the local filesystem; calling analyze_sitemap function; displaying and offering download of results",
  "flows": "File upload → saving file locally → analyzing file with analyze_sitemap → displaying and providing download of results",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles user input by saving the uploaded sitemap XML to a local file. It then calls an external function analyze_sitemap, which is assumed to perform the analysis. The code displays results and allows downloading them, all in a standard manner. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or data exfiltration observed. No embedded network calls or suspicious behavior. Overall, the code appears to be a benign, well-structured web app for SEO analysis.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward web application for sitemap analysis with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It uses standard libraries and practices, and no suspicious anomalies are detected.",
