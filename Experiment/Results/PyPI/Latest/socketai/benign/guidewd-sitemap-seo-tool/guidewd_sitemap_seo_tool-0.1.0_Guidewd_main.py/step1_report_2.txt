  "purpose": "The script dynamically installs and runs a Streamlit application by executing subprocess commands.",
  "sources": "Reading the current script location (__file__), importing subprocess, os, sys, and dynamically executing pip install and streamlit run commands.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.check_call and subprocess.run are used to execute system commands; the code calls 'pip install streamlit' and 'streamlit run' with the app path.",
  "flows": "Source: __file__, and import statements -> sink: subprocess commands executing pip install and streamlit run with the app path.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess for system command execution without input validation; potential for code injection if external input influences commands, though in this code the commands are static.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing necessary modules. It defines a function run_streamlit that checks for the presence of streamlit, installing it if missing, then runs a specified Streamlit script using subprocess. The main function calls run_streamlit. There are no external inputs, user inputs, or untrusted data sources; the commands executed are static and predefined. No obfuscated code or hidden malicious logic is present. The dynamic installation of dependencies is standard but could be risky if manipulated externally, though in this code it is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily installs and executes a Streamlit app, with no evidence of malicious behavior or backdoors. The use of subprocess to run system commands is standard but should be scrutinized if external inputs influence commands, which is not the case here. Overall, it appears to be a typical script for running a Streamlit app with minimal security risk.",
