  "purpose": "Defines the package version with a simple string assignment.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static assignment to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment without dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It contains no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic execution. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical package initialization files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
