  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for a Python package called 'guidewd-sitemap-seo-tool' including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Code reads package dependencies, package metadata, and the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None present; code primarily for package setup and metadata definition.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Usage of open(\"README.md\").read() for long_description may raise issues if the file is missing, but is common in setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package configuration. It specifies package name, version, dependencies, entry points for CLI, classifiers, Python version requirement, author info, description, and URL. It reads README.md for long description. No external data input or untrusted data handling is evident. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is standard for Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It functions to prepare the package for distribution with specified dependencies and metadata.",
