{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'guidewd-sitemap-seo-tool', used for package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and content of the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; it does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "N/A - The script is configuration/setup code with no data flow from source to sink, just static data assignments.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for a setup.py script with no unusual or suspicious elements. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools modules and defines package metadata and dependencies. It reads README.md for description, which could pose a minor risk if the file content is maliciously altered, but this is standard practice. No external data inputs are processed at runtime. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present. The dependencies listed ('requests' and 'streamlit') are common and not suspicious. Entry points define a command-line interface for the package. Overall, the script is typical for Python package distribution without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It merely provides package configuration information.",
