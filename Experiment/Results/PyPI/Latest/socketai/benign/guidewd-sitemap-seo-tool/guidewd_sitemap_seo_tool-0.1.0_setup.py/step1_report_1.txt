  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup parameters for the Python package 'guidewd-sitemap-seo-tool'.",
  "sources": "Reading package information from the script, including package dependencies, entry points, and metadata such as author and URL.",
  "sinks": "Installation of dependencies, execution of setup routines, or reading of README.md for long description.",
  "flows": "Execution of setup() uses metadata and dependencies to install and configure the package; reading README.md content as part of long_description.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic present. The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with typical parameters for a Python package, including name, version, packages, dependencies, entry points, classifiers, author info, and description. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is observed. The long_description is read from a local README.md file, which is a common practice and does not introduce malicious behavior. No anomalies such as suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for packaging a Python project. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code fragment.",
