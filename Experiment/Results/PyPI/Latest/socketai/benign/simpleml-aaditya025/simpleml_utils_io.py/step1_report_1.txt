  "purpose": "Provides functions to save and load models using pickle serialization.",
  "sources": "Filename parameter, file open/read/write operations.",
  "sinks": "pickle.load reading untrusted data from files, potential deserialization of malicious objects.",
  "flows": "load_model reads a file specified by filename, then unpickles data; save_model serializes a model to a file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle for serialization/deserialization, which is known to be unsafe with untrusted data. No input validation or safety checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for saving and loading models with pickle. pickle.dump is used for serialization, which is standard but unsafe with untrusted sources. pickle.load can execute arbitrary code if the input file contains malicious payloads, posing a significant security risk when loading untrusted files. There are no input sanitization, validation, or safety measures implemented. The functions are straightforward, but their security implications depend on how the filename parameter is managed. If filenames or files are user-controlled, this introduces a high risk of deserialization attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code's main security concern is the use of pickle.load, which can execute malicious code if loading untrusted data. There are no safeguards against this risk. It should only be used with trusted, validated files. The functions themselves are simple and not malicious, but their insecure use could lead to malicious code execution.",
