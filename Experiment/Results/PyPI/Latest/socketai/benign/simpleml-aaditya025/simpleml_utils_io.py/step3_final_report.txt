  "purpose": "Functions for serializing and deserializing models using pickle.",
  "sources": "open file operations in save_model and load_model functions",
  "sinks": "pickle.dump and pickle.load calls that process data from files",
  "flows": "save_model writes data to file via pickle.dump; load_model reads data via pickle.load",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of pickle with no validation or safeguards",
  "analysis": "The code uses pickle for serialization, which is inherently unsafe when handling untrusted data. It does not include validation, sanitization, or restrictions, making it vulnerable to arbitrary code execution if malicious pickle files are loaded. There are no obfuscation or malicious payloads embedded. The functions are simple and direct, with no complex logic or hidden behaviors. The security risk stems solely from the use of pickle on untrusted sources, which can execute arbitrary code during deserialization. The malware score is zero, as there are no malicious payloads. The obfuscation score is zero, reflecting clear, straightforward code. The security risk score is high (~0.75), justified by the potential for remote code execution if untrusted data is loaded. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9), given the well-known risks of pickle deserialization. Overall, the code itself is benign but insecure if misused, emphasizing the importance of trusted data sources or safer serialization methods.",
  "conclusion": "The code is not malicious but poses a significant security risk when loading untrusted pickle files due to potential arbitrary code execution. The scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero, and a high security risk score reflecting the inherent danger of pickle deserialization without validation.",
