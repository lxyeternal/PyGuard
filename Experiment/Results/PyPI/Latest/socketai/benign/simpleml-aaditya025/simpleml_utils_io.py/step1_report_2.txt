  "purpose": "Provides functions to save and load machine learning models using pickle serialization.",
  "sources": "Reads filename input from the user in both save_model and load_model functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses pickle.load() to deserialize data from a file, which could execute malicious code if the file is tampered with.",
  "flows": "Filename input → open() → pickle.dump()/pickle.load() → potentially executes malicious code during load.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; standard use of pickle for model serialization. No unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for saving and loading models with pickle, which is known to execute arbitrary code during unpickling if the input file is malicious. The functions are straightforward, with no additional checks or restrictions. The use of pickle for loading is inherently risky if the input file is untrusted, as it can lead to code execution vulnerabilities. The code itself does not implement any obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior directly, but the use of pickle.load() on untrusted files is a known security risk.",
  "conclusion": "While the code performs basic model serialization tasks, it relies on pickle, which is unsafe when loading data from untrusted sources. This could potentially lead to remote code execution if malicious pickle files are loaded. The code itself appears benign, but the security risk lies in the context of usage rather than the code structure.",
