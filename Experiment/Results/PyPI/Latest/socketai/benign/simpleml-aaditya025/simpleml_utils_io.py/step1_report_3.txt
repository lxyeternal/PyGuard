{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to save and load machine learning models using pickle serialization.",
  "sources": "The filename parameter in both functions, which is provided at runtime or from external sources.",
  "sinks": "The pickle.load function, which deserializes data from the file, potentially executing malicious code if the pickle file is maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "The filename input leads to open() calls, which are passed to pickle.load, creating a flow from external input to code execution during deserialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or unusual language features. The use of pickle for model serialization is common but inherently risky if loading untrusted files.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: save_model uses pickle.dump to serialize a model object to a file, and load_model uses pickle.load to deserialize a model object from a file. The primary concern is that pickle.load can execute arbitrary code if the input file is maliciously crafted. The code does not sanitize or verify the filename, so loading untrusted pickle files poses a significant security risk. The functions are straightforward and follow standard patterns for model persistence, but the use of pickle without safeguards introduces a potential attack vector if the files are untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is generally intended for model serialization and deserialization. However, using pickle.load on untrusted files can lead to remote code execution. No malicious intent is apparent in the code itself, but it is risky if used with untrusted data sources. The overall security risk is moderate, mainly due to pickle's inherent risks.",
