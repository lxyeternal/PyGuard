  "purpose": "Provides functions to save and load machine learning models using pickle serialization.",
  "sources": "Reads filename input from the user in both save_model and load_model functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses pickle.load to deserialize data from a file, which could execute malicious code if the file is malicious.",
  "flows": "Filename input → open file → pickle.load (deserialization), which executes potentially malicious code within the pickle data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior; standard use of pickle for serialization.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward functions for saving and loading models with pickle. Pickle is inherently unsafe when loading untrusted data because it can execute arbitrary code during deserialization. No input validation or security checks are performed on filenames or data being loaded. The functions are simple and do not contain obfuscated or malicious code by themselves, but their use with untrusted files poses security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself does not contain malicious behavior but poses security risks if used with untrusted pickle files. Loading untrusted pickles can lead to code execution vulnerabilities.",
