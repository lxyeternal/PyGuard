  "purpose": "Analysis of Python code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, network or file sinks, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec), hardcoded credentials or URLs.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variable manipulations, dynamic code execution results.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input functions flow into eval/exec or network/file sinks, indicating potential malicious data exfiltration or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with obfuscated code, hardcoded URLs or credentials, indirect data flows, suspicious variable names, dynamic code execution, and environment variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts. Hardcoded secrets and suspicious data flows increase concern. Benign code lacks these indicators. High suspicion is justified for code with eval/exec, obfuscation, and data exfiltration patterns. Benign code shows straightforward data handling without suspicious patterns. The overall risk depends on the presence of these indicators, with higher scores assigned when multiple suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code in the analyzed dependency shows varying levels of suspicion. Some instances exhibit obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicating potential malicious intent, warranting moderate to high malware and security risk scores. Benign code lacks these features. The overall assessment suggests a moderate supply chain security concern, especially for code with obfuscation and eval/exec usage.",
