  "conclusion": "The code in the analyzed dependency shows varying levels of suspicion. Some instances exhibit obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicating potential malicious intent, warranting moderate to high malware and security risk scores. Benign code lacks these features. The overall assessment suggests a moderate supply chain security concern, especially for code with obfuscation and eval/exec usage."
