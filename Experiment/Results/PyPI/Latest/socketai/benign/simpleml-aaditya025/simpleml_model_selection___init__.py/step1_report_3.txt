{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a sample Python script that performs data processing and possibly interacts with external resources, but the specific purpose is unclear due to lack of comments and context.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the user via input() calls and from environment variables, possibly files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, file writing, or executing system commands, but specific details are not provided in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (user input, environment variables) to processing functions, then potentially to sinks such as network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No suspicious dynamic execution or unusual variable names. Code appears straightforward and lacks suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input from the user and environment variables, processes data with standard functions, and may perform standard operations. Without specific network or system calls, it does not exhibit signs of malicious activity. Lack of comments or complex logic suggests standard functionality. No embedded or obfuscated code found. All third-party libraries used are common and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not show signs of malicious behavior or malware. It appears to be a standard script performing data processing with no evident security risks. Due to limited context, confidence remains moderate, but there are no indicators of malicious or sabotage intent.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
