  "purpose": "To assess the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing the provided code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from the code snippets and descriptions provided in the reports.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network connections, or execution points where untrusted data could cause harm or exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flow from input sources through processing functions to output or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "Any hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow patterns.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently indicate the code is benign, with no obfuscation or malicious activity detected. Malware scores are zero, and security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern. Confidence levels are high (0.6 to 0.9), supporting the benign assessment. The reasoning in each report aligns with the scores assigned, and no suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities are identified. Given the uniformity and thoroughness of the assessments, the overall conclusion is that the code is safe, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious or obfuscated components detected. The scores are consistent with the assessments, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall security posture is low risk, and confidence in this conclusion is high.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
