{
  "purpose": "Implementing a cross-validation scoring function for a machine learning model.",
  "sources": "Input data arrays X and y, and the model object with fit and predict methods.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not send data to external systems or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Data from X and y flows into model.fit and model.predict; scoring is based on comparison of predictions and true labels.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors detected. The code performs a straightforward cross-validation procedure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a train_test_split utility but does not use it; it performs manual cross-validation by splitting data into folds. The approach is simplistic but does not involve external data leaks or insecure operations. No suspicious or malicious activities are present; it only computes accuracy scores across folds. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are observed. The implementation lacks input validation and could be improved for robustness, but these are not security concerns per se.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cross-validation scoring without malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a typical machine learning utility, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors identified.",
