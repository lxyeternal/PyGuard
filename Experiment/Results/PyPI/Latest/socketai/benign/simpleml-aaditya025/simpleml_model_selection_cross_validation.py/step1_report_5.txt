  "purpose": "Implementing a cross-validation scoring function for evaluating a machine learning model.",
  "sources": "Input data arrays X and y, and the model's fit and predict methods.",
  "sinks": "Model's fit and predict functions, which process data and generate predictions.",
  "flows": "X and y are used as sources; model.fit and model.predict are sinks; data flows from input arrays to these methods, and predictions are compared to labels.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs a standard cross-validation procedure. The data splitting method is simple but correct for a basic CV implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a train_test_split utility but does not use it; instead, it manually slices the data arrays to create validation and training sets for each fold. It repeatedly fits the model and computes accuracy scores. The data splitting approach is straightforward and not suspicious. The model's methods are standard. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident in the code. The implementation appears standard for a cross-validation scoring function, with no obfuscation, malicious injections, or suspicious network activity. No sensitive data handling or external data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of cross-validation scoring for a machine learning model. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent. The code is straightforward and aligns with common practices.",
