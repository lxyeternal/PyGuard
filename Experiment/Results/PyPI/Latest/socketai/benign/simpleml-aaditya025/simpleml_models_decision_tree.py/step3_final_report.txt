{
  "purpose": "A minimal placeholder decision tree classifier that predicts the majority class from training labels.",
  "sources": "The 'fit' method reads the training labels 'y' to determine the most common class; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The 'predict' method outputs the stored majority class label for all inputs; no untrusted data is leaked or used maliciously.",
  "flows": "Input labels 'y' flow into 'fit' to determine the majority class, which then flows into 'predict' outputs for all inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code does nothing unusual; it is a straightforward, simplistic implementation acting as a placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The class does not implement an actual decision tree but instead stores the most common label from 'y' during 'fit'. The 'predict' method always returns this label for any input. There are no external dependencies, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code. The implementation is overly simplistic and appears to be a placeholder. No suspicious data flows, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code's benign nature indicates no security threats or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal placeholder classifier with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores should reflect this: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
