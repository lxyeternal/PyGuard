{
  "purpose": "Implement a simple decision tree classifier for predicting the most common class label.",
  "sources": "Input features X and labels y in the fit method.",
  "sinks": "Return the predicted class label; no data leaks or external sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Data from fit method (y) is used to determine the most common class, then predict method outputs this class for all inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no dynamic execution, and no external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimalistic DecisionTree class with fit and predict methods. The fit method stores the most frequent class label from y, while predict always returns this label for any input X. There are no input sanitizations, no external calls, or suspicious code flows. The implementation is overly simplified but benign. It appears to serve as a dummy classifier rather than a full decision tree, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, non-malicious implementation of a dummy classifier that always predicts the most common class. There are no indicators of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.",
