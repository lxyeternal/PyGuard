  "purpose": "Implementation of a simple decision tree classifier for making predictions based on training data.",
  "sources": "Input data X and target labels y in the fit method.",
  "sinks": "Prediction output in the predict method; no external sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to internal state (self.tree), then to prediction outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The fit method only stores the most common label; no actual decision tree logic or data processing. No use of external libraries or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimal DecisionTree class with initialization, fitting, and prediction methods. The fit method does not build a tree structure but simply records the most frequent class label. The predict method returns this label for all inputs. No external data sources, no unsafe operations, no code injection, and no malicious behavior are present. The implementation appears intentionally simplified and does not perform actual decision tree learning, but there are no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, simplistic implementation of a classifier that always predicts the most common class. It contains no malicious behavior, no hidden backdoors, and no security risks. It appears to be a minimal, possibly placeholder or educational, implementation with no security concerns.",
