  "purpose": "Implementation of a simple decision tree classifier for prediction tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data parameters 'X' and 'y' in the fit and predict methods.",
  "sinks": "Return value in predict method; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Data from input 'X' and 'y' flows into fit; prediction output flows out of predict.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; straightforward implementation with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The class defines a basic decision tree with methods for fitting and predicting. The fit method assigns a default prediction based on the most common class label in 'y'. The predict method returns the same predicted class for all inputs, based on the fit. No external data leaks, no suspicious code, no dynamic code execution, and no signs of malicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a simplistic machine learning model implementation without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, non-malicious implementation of a decision tree classifier with no signs of malware or security threats. It does not read external data beyond input parameters, nor does it perform any suspicious actions. It is safe from a security standpoint.",
