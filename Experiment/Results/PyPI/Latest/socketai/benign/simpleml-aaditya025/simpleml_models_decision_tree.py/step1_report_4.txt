  "purpose": "Implementation of a simple decision tree classifier for training and prediction.",
  "sources": "Input data in 'fit' method (features X and labels y), and input features X in 'predict' method.",
  "sinks": "The 'fit' method processes 'y' to determine the most common class; 'predict' outputs the predicted class for input X.",
  "flows": "The 'fit' method derives a majority class from 'y'; the 'predict' method returns this class for all inputs, ignoring input features.",
  "anomalies": "The model ignores input features during prediction, which is unusual for decision tree implementation but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The class defines a minimal decision tree structure. The 'fit' method calculates the most common label in 'y' but does not build a real decision tree. The 'predict' method always returns the same class for all inputs, regardless of their features. There are no external data reads, network operations, or dynamic code executions. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present. The implementation appears to be a placeholder or very simplified model, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simplistic, non-malicious implementation of a classifier that always predicts the most common class. It does not perform any harmful actions or contain malware. Its security risk is minimal, mainly due to its limited functionality.",
