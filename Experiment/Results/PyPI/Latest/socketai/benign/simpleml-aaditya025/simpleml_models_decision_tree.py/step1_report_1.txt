{
  "purpose": "A simple DecisionTree class implementation for basic classification tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data (X, y) provided to the fit method; data used for determining majority class.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Data from fit method (labels y) influences the prediction default; prediction outputs are based solely on stored tree info.",
  "anomalies": "The fit method does not construct a decision tree structure but instead assigns a static majority class; lacks typical decision tree logic. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a DecisionTree class with a constructor, fit, and predict methods. The fit method does not perform any actual tree building but instead assigns the majority class from y to self.tree['predict']. The predict method returns a list of this majority class for all inputs. There are no external data sources, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious operations. The implementation is overly simplistic and does not perform true decision tree training, but there is no malicious behavior or security risk observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a minimal, non-functional placeholder for a decision tree classifier, lacking actual model training logic. It does not contain malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It is a benign, if incomplete, implementation.",
