  "purpose": "Analysis of open source Python dependency for malicious behavior, supply chain risks, and security issues.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network data, dynamic imports, and code execution functions such as eval() and exec().",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via network connections, file operations, or system commands; dynamic code execution leading to possible malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Untrusted sources (environment, user input, network) to dangerous sinks (eval(), exec(), system calls).",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() on untrusted data, obfuscation patterns, dynamic imports, hardcoded secrets, and network activity without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits dynamic execution and obfuscation, which are suspicious indicators. Multiple reports show data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous functions, increasing suspicion. Benign reports lack such patterns. The presence of eval()/exec() on untrusted data, combined with obfuscation, suggests potential malicious intent, though no confirmed payloads are observed. The overall security risk is moderate, with higher suspicion in reports involving eval/exec and obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "Most code segments are suspicious due to dynamic execution and obfuscation, indicating a moderate supply chain security risk. No definitive malicious payloads are confirmed, but the potential for malicious behavior warrants caution. The malware score should reflect the suspicion level without overestimating confirmed malicious activity.",
