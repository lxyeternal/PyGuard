{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for a Python package that potentially performs data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose is unclear due to lack of context and minimal comments.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly shown; the code does not demonstrate reading from external inputs, environment variables, or network sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or subprocess calls, but none are explicitly present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly performs computations or data handling within the module.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code patterns are evident. The code structure and naming appear normal and consistent.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review of the code reveals no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, unauthorized system access, or obfuscated malicious code. The code uses standard Python features without suspicious patterns. There are no indications of code injection, insecure handling of data, or hidden backdoors. The absence of network activity, cryptic variables, or environment manipulation suggests a low risk of malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a typical open-source utility or component with no overt security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no indicators of malware or supply chain attacks. Confidence in this conclusion is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
