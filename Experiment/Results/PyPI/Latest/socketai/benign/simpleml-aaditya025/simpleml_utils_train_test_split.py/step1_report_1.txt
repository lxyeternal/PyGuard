{
  "purpose": "The code implements a function to split data into training and testing sets for machine learning purposes.",
  "sources": "The function reads input data arrays X and y, as well as optional parameters test_size and random_state.",
  "targets": "The code does not directly write to files, send data over networks, or execute system commands; it mainly manipulates data in memory.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the parameters into the function, processed by numpy and Python list comprehensions, resulting in split datasets.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code uses standard numpy functions and Python data structures without obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The function uses numpy to shuffle indices and split data into training and testing subsets based on specified test size and seed for reproducibility. The approach is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code. Usage of numpy's seed for reproducibility is standard. The data splitting logic is typical for machine learning workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate data splitting task without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard, safe code for in-memory data partitioning.",
