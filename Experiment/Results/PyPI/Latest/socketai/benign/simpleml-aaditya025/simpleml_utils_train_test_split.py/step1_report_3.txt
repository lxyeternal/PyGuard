{
  "purpose": "A utility function to split data into training and testing sets for machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads data inputs X and y, and optional random seed; uses numpy for random operations and array manipulations.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or malicious actions; function returns split datasets.",
  "flows": "Inputs X, y and optional seed → numpy random seed and shuffle → create indices → split indices into train/test → select data subsets based on indices → return split data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard train-test split by shuffling indices and slicing data accordingly. It utilizes numpy for randomness and array handling. No external or untrusted inputs are used insecurely; no hidden or malicious actions are present. The implementation aligns with common data science practices and contains no malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for data splitting without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is well-structured and follows standard procedures for machine learning data preparation.",
