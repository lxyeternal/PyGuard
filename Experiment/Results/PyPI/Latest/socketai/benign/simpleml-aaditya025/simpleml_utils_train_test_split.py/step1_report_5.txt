{
  "purpose": "This code implements a function to split datasets into training and testing subsets.",
  "sources": "The function reads input data arrays X and y, as well as optional parameters test_size and random_state.",
  "sinks": "The function uses untrusted parameters (random_state, test_size) to control data splitting but does not directly leak data or sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input arrays X and y through the splitting logic, influenced by the seed (if provided) for reproducibility.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code were observed. The use of np.random.seed and np.random.shuffle appears standard for reproducible random splitting.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy, defines a function for splitting data, seeds the random number generator if specified, shuffles indices, and slices the data accordingly. All operations are typical for data splitting in machine learning workflows. No suspicious code, hidden behavior, or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a train-test split function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
