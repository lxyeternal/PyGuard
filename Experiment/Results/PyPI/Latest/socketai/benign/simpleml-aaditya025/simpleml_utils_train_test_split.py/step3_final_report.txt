  "purpose": "Implement a train-test split utility for machine learning datasets using numpy.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays X and y, and optional random seed for reproducibility.",
  "sinks": "In-memory data structures; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data -> shuffle indices -> slice data into train/test sets.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of train-test splitting using numpy. It seeds the random generator if provided, shuffles indices, and slices data accordingly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, network activity, or data exfiltration. The code uses standard practices and handles data in-memory without external interactions. No anomalies or obfuscation are present. The logic aligns with common data splitting functions, and the code is clear and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for data splitting with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
