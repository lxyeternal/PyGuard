{
  "purpose": "The function splits datasets into training and testing subsets for machine learning purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input datasets X and y, as well as optional parameters test_size and random_state.",
  "sinks": "Uses numpy's random seed and shuffle functions; data is split into subsets in memory.",
  "flows": "Input data X and y are processed with random seed setting, shuffling, and slicing to create train/test splits.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of numpy functions is standard; no obfuscation or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and defines a function for train-test splitting. It sets a random seed if provided, creates an index array, shuffles it, and splits the data based on test_size. It reconstructs training and testing datasets by indexing into X and y with the shuffled indices. The approach is straightforward and follows typical practices for dataset partitioning. No unusual code, no hidden network calls, no data exfiltration, or malicious behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard train-test split on provided datasets. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a legitimate utility function for data splitting in machine learning workflows.",
