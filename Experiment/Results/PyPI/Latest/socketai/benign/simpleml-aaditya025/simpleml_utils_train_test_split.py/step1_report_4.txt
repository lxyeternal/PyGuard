{
  "purpose": "The code implements a function to split datasets into training and testing subsets.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data 'X' and labels 'y' provided as function parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code processes data internally; no direct sink that leads to data leak or malicious activity detected.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the function, which processes and outputs training and testing splits.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code uses standard numpy functions and list comprehensions without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy, defines a function for train-test splitting that seeds the random number generator for reproducibility, creates an index array, shuffles it, and splits data accordingly. No hardcoded credentials, no external network activity, and no suspicious code paths. The logic is straightforward, typical for dataset splitting, and does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of train-test data splitting without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
