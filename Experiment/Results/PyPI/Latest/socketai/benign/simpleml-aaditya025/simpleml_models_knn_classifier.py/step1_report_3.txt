{
  "purpose": "Implement a simple k-nearest neighbors classifier for supervised learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data X and labels y in the fit method; input data X in the predict method.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data causes data leaks or harmful effects. The code performs standard computations only.",
  "flows": "Input data X flows into the fit method for training and into the predict method for inference; data is processed to compute distances and determine labels.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. Uses standard numpy operations; no dynamic execution or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic k-NN classifier with standard methods: fit and predict. It utilizes numpy for vectorized distance computation and label voting. The implementation is straightforward and aligns with common k-NN logic. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or security risks. The code does not perform any network communication, file operations, or access sensitive information. No anomalies or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a k-NN classifier with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard machine learning operations without any suspicious behavior.",
