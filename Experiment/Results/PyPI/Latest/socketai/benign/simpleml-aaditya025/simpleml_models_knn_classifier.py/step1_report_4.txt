  "purpose": "Implement a simple k-Nearest Neighbors classifier for machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'X' and 'y' for training, and 'X' for prediction.",
  "sinks": "Predicted labels appended to 'preds' list.",
  "flows": "Input data (X, y) → fit method storing training data; New data X → predict method calculating distances → neighbor selection → label voting → output predictions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. Uses standard numpy functions for calculations; no obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward KNN classifier with methods to fit training data and predict labels. Data is stored in class variables, and predictions are based on calculating Euclidean distances. No external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious side effects are present. The implementation appears correct and typical for such algorithms.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a basic KNN classifier without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard operations for machine learning classification tasks and contains no anomalous or malicious code patterns.",
