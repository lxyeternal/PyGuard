{
  "purpose": "Implement a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier for supervised learning tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the parameters 'X' and 'y' in 'fit' and 'predict' methods.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects; the code performs standard array operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into internal numpy arrays, then used for distance calculations and voting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard KNN classifier with no suspicious behavior. It converts inputs to numpy arrays, calculates Euclidean distances, and predicts labels based on majority voting among nearest neighbors. The code structure is straightforward, with no embedded malicious logic, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It appears to be a typical machine learning implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a KNN classifier with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns. The likelihood of malware is extremely low, and the code does not pose a security threat.",
