{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a simple k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier for supervised machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data: method parameters 'X' and 'y' in fit() and predict() functions, which are expected to be datasets provided during model training and prediction.",
  "sinks": "Output: predicted labels returned by predict(). No external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from method parameters to internal numpy array conversions; distance calculations and label predictions flow from input data to output predictions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code performs standard KNN operations with numpy and appears straightforward. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard KNN classifier with fit() and predict() methods, converting input lists to numpy arrays for efficient computation. It computes Euclidean distances using np.linalg.norm, selects k nearest neighbors, and predicts the label by majority vote. No suspicious or malicious code constructs, external network calls, or security-compromising operations are present. The implementation aligns with common ML practices and contains no signs of tampering or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a normal implementation of a KNN classifier without malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation, suspicious data handling, or malicious activities. Overall, it is safe based on this review.",
