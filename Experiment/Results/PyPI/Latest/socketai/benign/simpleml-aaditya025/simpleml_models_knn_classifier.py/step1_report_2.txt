  "purpose": "Implementation of a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier for supervised learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data X in fit() and predict() methods.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data used for sensitive operations or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from fit() and predict() methods, through distance calculations, to neighbor label selection, then to final predictions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded parameters are standard, and no obfuscated or unusual code structures present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard KNN classifier using numpy for numerical operations. It stores training data in fit() and computes Euclidean distances in predict(). It finds neighbors and predicts labels via majority voting. No suspicious code, external communications, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code appears straightforward and adheres to typical machine learning implementation patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of a KNN classifier without any malicious behavior or security risks identified. It does not contain any backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious side-effects.",
