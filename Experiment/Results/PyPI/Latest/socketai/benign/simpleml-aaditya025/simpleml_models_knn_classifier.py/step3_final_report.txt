  "purpose": "Implementation of a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier for supervised learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Input feature data provided to fit() and predict() methods.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data outputs; data flows within numpy array operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through distance calculations to majority voting for predictions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, straightforward implementation of a KNN classifier using numpy for data conversion, Euclidean distance calculation, and majority voting. It contains no malicious behavior, external communications, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious activities are present. The code's simplicity and clarity support a conclusion of no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing a typical KNN classifier without malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
