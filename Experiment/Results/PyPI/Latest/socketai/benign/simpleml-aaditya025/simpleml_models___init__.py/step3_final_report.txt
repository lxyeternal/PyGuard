  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, user inputs, files, and potentially network or system calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are network connections, file operations, dynamic code execution points (`exec`, `eval`), and data exfiltration vectors.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through variables or functions, potentially reaching sinks via dynamic execution or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious patterns include obfuscated variable names, use of `exec`/`eval`, hardcoded URLs/credentials, unexplained imports, and dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code in reports 3 and 4 appears benign, with straightforward structure, no obfuscation, and no malicious patterns. Report 5 exhibits obfuscation, dynamic execution, and suspicious constructs, indicating likely malicious intent. Reports 1 and 2 lack code, so no analysis is possible. The scores assigned in the reports align with these observations, with high suspicion in report 5 justified by the indicators. The overall scoring reflects the evidence, with benign reports scoring zero and report 5 showing elevated malware (0.6), obfuscation (0.8), and risk (0.65).",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that reports 3 and 4 are benign with appropriate low scores. Report 5 contains indicators of malicious behavior, justifying high malware and obfuscation scores. Reports 1 and 2 lack code for assessment. The scores are consistent with the evidence, and further investigation into report 5 is recommended due to its suspicious patterns.",
