{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the installation or setup of a Python package, potentially involving network communication, as inferred from the presence of URL and request modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules, environment variables, and potentially network sources via URL or request calls.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could be sent over network requests or used in system commands, but no explicit sinks are identified without specific functions being shown.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or network sources to request functions or output mechanisms, though specifics are not provided in the excerpt.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident; however, lack of detailed code makes it difficult to detect obfuscation or malicious logic. The code structure appears standard, with no unusual language features or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code involves standard imports and appears to focus on package setup or network communication. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads. The absence of explicit data leaks, system modification commands, or suspicious network activity suggests low likelihood of malicious intent. Due to limited details, the confidence in detecting malicious behavior is moderate.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no clear indicators of malicious activity or security risks. The code seems typical for a Python package setup or network operation, with no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
