  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low security risk; however, the use of eval() and dynamic imports in report 5 suggests obfuscation and potential malicious behavior. The current scores are appropriate but should be elevated slightly to reflect the suspicious patterns. Continuous monitoring is recommended for code employing dynamic execution functions, especially in supply chain contexts."
