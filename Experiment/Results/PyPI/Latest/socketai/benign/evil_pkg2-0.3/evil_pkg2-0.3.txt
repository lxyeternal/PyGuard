      "conclusion": "The code itself is benign but contains a highly suspicious endpoint '/evil' that suggests malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable but should be slightly adjusted downward for malware suspicion (around 0.4) and risk (around 0.65), reflecting suspicion based on naming without concrete malicious payloads. Further server-side analysis is recommended to determine if the endpoint is malicious or benign."
