  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and data flow anomalies.",
  "sources": "Input functions (`input()`, environment variables), external data sources, untrusted data inputs.",
  "sinks": "Print statements, network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as user input or environment variables flow into processing functions, with no evidence of malicious data manipulation or exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected. Slightly unvalidated input handling noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets described are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Input handling is minimal and benign. No suspicious data flows or backdoors are evident. The confidence in benign nature is high, with scores reflecting minimal security concern. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. Security risks are minimal, primarily due to unvalidated input handling, but overall, the code is safe. The current malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are justified. Risk scores are low (around 0.1–0.2), aligning with the benign assessment.",
