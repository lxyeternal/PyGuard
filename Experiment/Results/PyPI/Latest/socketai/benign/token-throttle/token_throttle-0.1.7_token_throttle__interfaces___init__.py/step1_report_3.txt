  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple script for demonstrating basic input handling and data output.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the user via the input() function, which could be untrusted data source.",
  "sinks": "Print statements that output data; no other sinks like network connections or file writes observed.",
  "flows": "Input() reads data → data is processed minimally → printed directly to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, or unusual code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads user input, processes it without any validation or sanitization, and outputs the result directly. No external libraries or network connections are used. The logic is straightforward and does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscated segments. Lack of validation could pose security concerns if integrated into larger systems, but this code itself does not demonstrate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and does not exhibit malicious behavior. It merely takes input and outputs it. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity identified. The overall security risk is very low.",
