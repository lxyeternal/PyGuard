  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. Security risks are minimal, primarily due to unvalidated input handling, but overall, the code is safe. The current malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are justified. Risk scores are low (around 0.1–0.2), aligning with the benign assessment."
