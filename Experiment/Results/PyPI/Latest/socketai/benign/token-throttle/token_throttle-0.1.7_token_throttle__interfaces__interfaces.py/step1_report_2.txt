{
  "purpose": "Defines interfaces, data models, and base classes for a token rate limiting system, including usage tracking and capacity management.",
  "sources": "Import statements from standard libraries (abc, typing) and third-party packages (pydantic). Class and method definitions, especially data models and protocol classes.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as the code primarily contains class and method definitions without executing untrusted data or performing I/O operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code defines abstract classes and data models; no actual data flow or execution logic present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors detected. Use of Protocols and ABCs aligns with interface definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured definitions for rate limiter interfaces, configuration models, and callback protocols. It imports libraries for type safety, data validation, and flexible configurations. No dynamic code execution, no network operations, or data handling from untrusted sources are present. The code appears to be a well-structured part of a larger system, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of interface and data model definitions for a token rate limiting system. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident based on this fragment. It functions as part of a larger application, focusing on interface contracts and configuration schemas.",
