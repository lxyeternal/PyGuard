{
  "purpose": "Define interfaces, data models, and abstract classes for a rate limiting system, ensuring modularity and configurability.",
  "sources": "Configuration fields (quotas, usage_counter, model_family), get_model_family method, class initializations",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not process external input or perform network/file operations",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from class attributes to methods like get_model_family; no external data flow or dynamic execution",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; code is straightforward and structural",
  "analysis": "The code comprises interface definitions, data models, and abstract base classes for rate limiting. It uses standard Python constructs such as Protocols, ABCs, and pydantic models. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The get_model_family method enforces the presence of a required attribute, which is a typical safety check. The overall structure is clean, readable, and adheres to best practices. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the static, interface-only nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard component of a rate limiting system with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, and the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0. The reports are consistent and accurate; no adjustments are necessary.",
