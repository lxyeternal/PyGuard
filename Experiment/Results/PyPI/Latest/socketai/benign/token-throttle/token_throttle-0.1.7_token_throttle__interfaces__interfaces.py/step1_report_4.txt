{
  "purpose": "This code defines interfaces and models for a rate limiting system for API requests, including configuration classes, protocols, and abstract base classes for backend implementations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class attributes, method parameters, and imported modules. No external or untrusted data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations like network access, file writing, or command execution are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class and method attributes (e.g., quotas, usage_counter, model_family) through method calls and properties within the code. No untrusted data flows to critical security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are evident. The code uses standard patterns for defining interfaces and data models. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes data models, protocols, and abstract classes to facilitate rate limiting functionality. UsageCounter is a protocol for counting resource usage, with no implementation details. PerModelConfig holds configuration data, including quotas and optional usage counters. Methods enforce constraints like model_family presence and provide properties like is_unlimited. Interface classes define expected behaviors for backend building and rate limiter operations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is purely structural and interface-based, with no active or executable malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of interface and data model definitions for a rate limiting system. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. It appears safe for use in a larger system without security concerns.",
