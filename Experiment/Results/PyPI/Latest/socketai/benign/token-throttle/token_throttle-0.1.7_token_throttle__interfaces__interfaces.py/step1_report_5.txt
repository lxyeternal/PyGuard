{
  "purpose": "This code defines interfaces and data models for a rate-limiting system, primarily used to control API request usage.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the 'usage' data passed to methods like 'acquire_capacity' and 'await_for_capacity', and configuration data provided via 'PerModelConfig'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include method calls that handle usage data, but no direct data output or external network interactions are present in this code segment.",
  "flows": "Flow involves usage data being passed into rate limiter methods, which process and manage capacity reservations; no external data flows are evident in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior observed. Usage of standard Python typing, pydantic models, and ABCs is typical for interface definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of interface and data model definitions for rate limiting, with no implementation logic or external data handling. No obfuscated or malicious patterns detected. The code adheres to standard practices for defining protocols, models, and abstract classes. The absence of network calls, data exfiltration, or system modification code reduces suspicion. The code appears purely structural, intended for use as part of a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of interface and data model definitions for a rate-limiting framework. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this fragment.",
