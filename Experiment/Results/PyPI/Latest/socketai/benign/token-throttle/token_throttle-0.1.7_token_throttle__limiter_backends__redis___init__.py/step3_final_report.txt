  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from environment variables, files, network sources, or code execution points such as eval.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmission of sensitive data, code execution points, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or network inputs to sinks such as eval, network calls, or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, lack of suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate either no code or benign data processing scripts with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Malware scores are consistently zero, and risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern. Confidence levels vary based on available information, generally high when code is present and no issues are found. Slight overestimations of risk in some reports (0.2) can be refined to 0.1 for accuracy. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the evidence, and no significant threats are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are accurate and conservative in their evaluation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. Minor adjustments to risk scores could improve precision, but current scores are justified. The dependencies are considered benign based on available information.",
