{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a typical Python script that performs data processing, possibly related to user input or file handling, without any explicit malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input functions (e.g., reading from files, user input, environment variables), data loading from external sources",
  "sinks": "Output functions (e.g., print statements, file writes), network calls (if any), system commands",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, with no evident untrusted data handling leading to dangerous operations",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads data from standard input or files, processes it with standard Python functions, and outputs results. No signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior. The code structure is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated or misleading constructs. There are no external network calls or system commands that could indicate malicious activity. The code does not use insecure functions or vulnerable practices. Overall, the code appears benign based on the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard data processing tasks without suspicious behavior.",
