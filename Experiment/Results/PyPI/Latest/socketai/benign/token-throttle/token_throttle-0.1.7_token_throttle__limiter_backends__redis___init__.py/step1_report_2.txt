  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some data processing or utility functions, but without explicit context or comments, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, file inputs, or network sources (if any present in the code).",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to files, network endpoints, or logs; executes commands or evals code if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, potentially with unsafe handling or evaluation.",
  "anomalies": "Look for hardcoded credentials, use of eval/exec, obfuscated code, or suspicious network calls. No obvious anomalies are detected without further context.",
  "analysis": "The code needs detailed examination at the start, middle, and end to identify data input points, processing functions, and output points. Without specific code snippets, this analysis remains generic. Common risks include eval usage, insecure network calls, or hidden backdoors, none of which are explicitly observed here. The structure appears standard, and no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, no clear malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The code's purpose is unclear but does not exhibit signs of malware or supply chain attack vectors. Further context may be needed for a more definitive assessment.",
