  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the provided details.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines callback protocols and a logging configuration, with functions to generate loguru-based callbacks. No malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no suspicious data flows.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Clear code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — Very low, mainly because it involves logging callbacks.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is primarily for structured logging. The dynamic import of loguru and the use of async functions are standard. No evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the benign nature of the logging functions, dynamic import handling, and no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the first report. The code is straightforward, and the logging callbacks are for operational purposes only.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code defines callback protocols and a logging utility with dynamic import handling. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code's purpose is clear, and no security concerns are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar observations—standard callback protocols, safe dynamic import, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is safe and intended for logging.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides structured logging callbacks, with no suspicious behavior or malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely for defining callback protocols and generating logging functions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected across all reports.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0.1), justified by the fact that this code is for logging and callback configuration only, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code's purpose is to facilitate structured logging during rate limiting operations.\n- It dynamically imports 'loguru' and raises an exception if not installed, which is standard and safe.\n- The callback functions only invoke logging with provided data; no external network calls, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n### My Own Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malware activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — Minimal, primarily due to dependency handling.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured, and serves a benign purpose. No security concerns or malicious activity are present.",
