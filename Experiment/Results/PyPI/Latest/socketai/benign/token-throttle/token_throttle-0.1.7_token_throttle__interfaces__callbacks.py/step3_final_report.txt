{
  "purpose": "Defines callback protocols and a configuration model for rate limiter logging callbacks, along with functions to generate loguru-based logging callbacks with customizable log levels.",
  "sources": "Dynamic import of 'loguru' within _get_loguru_logger(), callback functions receiving parameters such as model_family, usage, capacities, wait times, and other metrics.",
  "sinks": "Logging calls to loguru's logger.log method, passing structured data; no external data sources or untrusted inputs processed into system commands or network calls.",
  "flows": "Callback functions receive parameters and invoke logger.log with these parameters; no external data flows into the system beyond the function inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected. Dynamic import is handled safely with exception raising if 'loguru' is missing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines callback protocols for a rate limiter, a configuration model, and a function to create logging callbacks using 'loguru'. The dynamic import is safely managed, and the callbacks only perform logging operations with provided data. No malicious activity, external data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign, standard logging utility purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured logging utility for rate limiter callbacks, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
