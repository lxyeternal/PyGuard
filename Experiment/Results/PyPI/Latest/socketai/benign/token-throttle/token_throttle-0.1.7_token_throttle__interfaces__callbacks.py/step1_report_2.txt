{
  "purpose": "Define callback protocols and a configuration model for rate limiter event handling, including log-based callbacks.",
  "sources": "Import statements, callback protocol method definitions, create_loguru_callbacks function which dynamically imports loguru and constructs callback functions with logging.",
  "sinks": "Logging functions within create_loguru_callbacks that output messages to loguru logger, but no data sinks that handle untrusted external data or network communication.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to callback functions flow into logging calls; the callback functions are assigned to configuration objects but do not execute further untrusted actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import of 'loguru' only when needed; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling present; callback functions primarily log messages.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several protocols for callbacks related to rate limiting events, with a configuration class to hold these callbacks. The function create_loguru_callbacks dynamically imports 'loguru' and creates asynchronous logging callbacks with customizable log levels. The code ensures 'loguru' is installed before use. No untrusted data is processed or transferred outside the scope of logging. The code’s purpose is purely to facilitate structured event logging during rate limiting operations, with no indication of malicious intent. It adheres to good practices and avoids risky behaviors like executing untrusted input or network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, mainly providing structured callback configuration with logging capabilities. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The dynamic import of 'loguru' is safe, and no suspicious data handling or malicious actions are evident.",
