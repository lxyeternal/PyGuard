  "purpose": "Define callback protocols and a configuration model for rate limiter events, including logging functions using loguru.",
  "sources": "Imports (typing, pydantic, token_throttle, loguru), function parameters, internal logger import",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs via loguru, potential exception raising in logger import, no data leaks or external calls present",
  "flows": "Code imports logging module -> create_loguru_callbacks function calls internal logger -> logs messages based on callback triggers",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code uses standard patterns for defining protocols, models, and logging callbacks without obfuscation or hidden code",
  "analysis": "The code establishes various callback protocols for rate limiter events, with a model to store these callbacks. It includes a function to dynamically import a logging library, raising an exception if not installed. The create_loguru_callbacks function generates asynchronous logging callbacks based on provided string identifiers, defaulting to 'DEBUG' level. The logic is straightforward, primarily for logging purposes. No suspicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious network activity, is evident. The code relies on standard Python features, proper exception handling for missing dependencies, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of callback protocols and a logging utility for rate limiting, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
