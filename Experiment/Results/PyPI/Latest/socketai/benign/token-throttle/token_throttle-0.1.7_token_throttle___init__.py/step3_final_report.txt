{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a static module defining imports, constants, and export symbols for a token rate limiting library related to OpenAI models, primarily facilitating rate limiting, token counting, and Redis backend support.",
  "sources": "Import statements from various internal modules, version declaration, and __all__ list defining exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data processing, external data input, or network communication; purely static import/export setup.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only contains import statements and symbol exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static module comprising import statements, version info, and an export list. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external communication. The absence of dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious patterns indicates a benign setup component. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score is very low (around 0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk given the static nature, though potential misuse in broader contexts is theoretically possible but not evidenced here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static interface and configuration module for a token rate limiting library. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The scores are consistent with its benign static structure, and no further security concerns are warranted.",
