{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a web server that handles HTTP requests, possibly for serving a web application or API.",
  "sources": "The code reads HTTP request data from incoming network connections.",
  "sinks": "The code writes responses to the network socket; it may also process input data, but no clear data leaks or unsafe sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input from network requests (sources) is processed and then used to generate responses (sinks). No evidence of data leakage or malicious data flow found.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The code uses standard libraries and practices. No obfuscated code detected. No unusual dynamic execution or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a simple HTTP server using standard Python libraries. It listens on a specified port, accepts requests, and sends back predefined responses. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or covert channels is detected. All code appears legitimate and straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns. Usage of environment variables or external data sources is absent or benign. The code structure is typical for a minimal web server implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a basic HTTP server setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and free from malware or malicious behaviors. The risk assessment score is very low.",
