  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, security issues, and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Code input, data read operations, environment variables, network requests, file I/O.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writing, environment variable access, data output.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks through function calls, data processing, network handling, or environment access.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network connections, obfuscated code, unusual data flows, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is either absent or minimal, with no suspicious patterns, malicious code, or obfuscation detected. In the case of benign server code, standard libraries and straightforward logic are used, with no malicious intent. The absence of code prevents detailed source-to-sink flow analysis, but the provided descriptions indicate no malicious activity. Confidence scores are adjusted accordingly, with high confidence where code exists and low where code is missing. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero across all reports, and security risk scores are minimal, reflecting the benign nature of the code or lack thereof.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent with the evidence; no malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected. The security risk is very low, and the scores accurately reflect the analysis. No further action is necessary unless new code or suspicious patterns are introduced.",
