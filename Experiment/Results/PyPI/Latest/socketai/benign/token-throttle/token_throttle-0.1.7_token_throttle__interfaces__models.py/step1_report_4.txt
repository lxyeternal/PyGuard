{
  "purpose": "Define data models and classes for managing quotas, usage, and capacity reservations, primarily for rate limiting and resource management.",
  "sources": "Input data includes quota specifications, usage mappings, and capacity reservations; these are used to initialize and manipulate internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that could lead to data leaks, code execution, or malicious actions; functions primarily process data internally without external interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into object initialization and method calls; usage data is converted into immutable structures; no untrusted external data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious logic. Usage of type annotations, data validation, and warnings are standard. No suspicious network or file operations present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models using pydantic, with enum and type annotations for clarity. The UsageQuotas class manages rate limit quotas, ensuring no duplicate metrics are added, and providing methods to access quotas and check if unlimited. CapacityReservation encapsulates usage data and model info. All data handling appears straightforward and standard for resource management, with no suspicious code patterns or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for managing quotas and usage data, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It performs typical data handling and validation without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
