  "purpose": "CLI tool for building and optionally pushing/loading a Docker container for hosting a static site.",
  "sources": "Reads content directory provided by user; reads registry credentials; reads Dockerfile template; reads Docker build context.",
  "sinks": "Docker build process; Docker registry login; file writing for Dockerfile; directory copying.",
  "flows": "User input -> validate content path -> create Docker build context -> generate Dockerfile -> build/push/load image.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Uses standard libraries and trusted third-party modules. No obfuscated or malicious code observed. No network communication beyond Docker operations. No data exfiltration or harmful system commands.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily facilitates Docker image building for static sites with options to push or load the image. It validates user-provided content directory, handles optional Docker registry login, generates a Dockerfile from a template, and manages Docker buildx operations. The code employs secure practices such as validation and temporary directories. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code relies on standard and well-known libraries for Docker and filesystem operations. There are no hidden or obfuscated commands or network communications outside legitimate Docker interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for containerizing static sites with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It employs standard procedures and libraries for Docker image creation, with no suspicious anomalies. Overall security risk is minimal.",
