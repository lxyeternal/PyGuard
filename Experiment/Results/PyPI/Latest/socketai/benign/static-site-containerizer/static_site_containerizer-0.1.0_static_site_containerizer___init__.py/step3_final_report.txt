  "purpose": "CLI tool for building Docker images for static sites, with options to push or load images.",
  "sources": "User input for content directory, registry credentials, and build options; reading and writing Dockerfile; Docker registry login.",
  "sinks": "Docker build process, registry login, and image push/load operations.",
  "flows": "Input validation -> Dockerfile generation -> Docker build -> Optional registry login -> Push/load -> Cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Docker image build operations with proper validation, resource management, and optional registry authentication. It uses well-known libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security flaws. The registry credentials are handled securely in memory, and no network activity beyond Docker operations is present. The code's structure and behavior are straightforward and align with typical containerization workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured CLI utility for containerizing static sites. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are appropriate and justified.",
