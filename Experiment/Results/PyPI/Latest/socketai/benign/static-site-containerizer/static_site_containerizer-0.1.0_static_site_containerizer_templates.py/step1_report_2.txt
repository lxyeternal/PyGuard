  "purpose": "Define a template for generating Dockerfiles for NGINX images with customizable base image and content path.",
  "sources": "Variables $base_image and $content_path used to insert user-defined values into the Dockerfile template.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data processing present; template variables are placeholders intended for external input.",
  "flows": "External input for $base_image and $content_path flows into the template to generate Dockerfile content.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward template definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Template class, defines a Dockerfile template with placeholders for base image and content path. No code execution, data processing, or security-sensitive operations are present. The use of placeholders indicates this is meant to generate Dockerfiles dynamically, which is common and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign template for Dockerfile generation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code fragment.",
