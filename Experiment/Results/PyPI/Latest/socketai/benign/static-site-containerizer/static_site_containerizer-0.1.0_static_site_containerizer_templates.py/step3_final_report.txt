  "purpose": "A Python module defining a string.Template for generating a Dockerfile with placeholders for base image and content path.",
  "sources": "Variables `$base_image` and `$content_path` used in string.Template placeholders.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output beyond template substitution.",
  "flows": "Input variables `$base_image` and `$content_path` are substituted into the template; no data flows beyond string formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward template with no code execution, secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports `Template` from `string`, defines a Dockerfile template with placeholders, and contains no malicious logic or obfuscated code. The primary security concern is the potential misuse of untrusted input variables, which could lead to insecure images if variables are not sanitized, but this is outside the code's scope. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assign malware scores of 0, and low security risk scores reflecting potential misuse if inputs are malicious. The code is simple, transparent, and safe in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward template with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main security consideration is external input validation, not the code itself. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk, primarily dependent on how variables are supplied during actual use.",
