{
  "purpose": "Defines a Dockerfile template for creating an NGINX container with customizable base image and content path.",
  "sources": "Variables `$base_image` and `$content_path` used in the Template class, which are intended to be substituted at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink operations; the template generates a Dockerfile instruction set, not executing code or handling untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Values `$base_image` and `$content_path` are substituted into the template, which then produces Dockerfile instructions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and intended for templating.",
  "analysis": "The code imports `Template` from the `string` module to define a Dockerfile template with placeholders. It does not execute any dynamic or malicious operations. The template could be used with user-supplied variables, but this is standard for templating systems. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a simple, non-malicious template definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign template for Dockerfile generation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines a template structure for later substitution, which is common practice.",
