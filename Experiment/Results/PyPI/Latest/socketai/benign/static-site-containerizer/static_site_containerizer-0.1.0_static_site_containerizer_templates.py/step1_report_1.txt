  "purpose": "Defines a Dockerfile template for creating NGINX images with customizable base image and content path.",
  "sources": "The variables $base_image and $content_path are placeholders for input data.",
  "sinks": "The template will generate a Dockerfile that copies files into an NGINX container; no direct data leak or malicious effect present.",
  "flows": "User provides values for $base_image and $content_path, which are substituted into the template; these values then determine the resulting Dockerfile's behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Template class from the string module and defines a Dockerfile template with placeholders for base image and content path. It appears to be a simple, standard templating mechanism for generating Dockerfiles. No code execution, data leakage, or malicious logic present. Variables are placeholders for user-supplied input at runtime, which is typical for templates.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward template definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and intended for use in generating Dockerfiles dynamically.",
