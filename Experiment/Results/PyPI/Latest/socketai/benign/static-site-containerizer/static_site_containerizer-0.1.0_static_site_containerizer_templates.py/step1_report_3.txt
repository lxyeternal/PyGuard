  "purpose": "This code provides a template for creating a Dockerfile that sets up an Nginx server with specified content.",
  "sources": "The variables $base_image and $content_path, which are intended to be substituted with specific values when generating the Dockerfile.",
  "sinks": "The generated Dockerfile might be used to deploy web content; no immediate security sinks are present in this template code.",
  "flows": "Input variables ($base_image and $content_path) are substituted into the template, which then results in a Dockerfile content that, if used improperly, could lead to insecure container configurations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, using string.Template for variable substitution. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple string template for creating a Dockerfile with Nginx. It only substitutes provided variables for the base image and content path. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic. The template could be misused if the variables are improperly sanitized, but the code itself does not include malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign code snippet providing a Dockerfile template. It does not contain malware or security risks by itself. Its security depends on the input variables used during template rendering, which are not part of this code. Overall, it poses low security concern.",
