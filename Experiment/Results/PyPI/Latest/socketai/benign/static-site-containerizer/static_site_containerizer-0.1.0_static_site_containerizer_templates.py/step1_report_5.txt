  "purpose": "Define a Dockerfile template for creating NGINX container images with customizable base image and content path.",
  "sources": "The template accepts external variables: $base_image and $content_path.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the use of untrusted values for $base_image and $content_path could lead to malicious image builds or content injection.",
  "flows": "External input (e.g., user-provided or external variables) flow into the template, which then generates Dockerfile content used to build container images.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. The code uses standard string templating with no obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a string template for a Dockerfile that pulls from a specified base image and copies content from a specified path into the nginx html directory. There is no code execution, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The template allows external variables, which could be misused if untrusted input is provided; however, this is a common pattern in templating systems. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious functions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward template for generating Dockerfiles, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. The primary concern is the potential misuse of external variables if not sanitized, but this is typical in templating systems and not inherently malicious.",
