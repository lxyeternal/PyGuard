  "sources": "No data sources; only metadata comments, version string, and import statements.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static import/export setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python module __init__ file. It includes licensing comments, version info, and imports two functions from a local module, exposing them via __all__. There are no dynamic executions, data handling, or obfuscation. The code's simplicity and transparency indicate no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or security issues. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscation score 0, and security risk score very low (0 or 0.1). No adjustments are necessary.",
