{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to define a Python module that exposes functions related to SSIMULACRA2, which likely perform image similarity or artifact analysis.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from a local module (.ssimulacra2) and reads version and license information via comments. No user input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks, system damage, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources leading to sinks; the code is purely defining and exporting functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The license and version comments are standard. No obfuscated or dynamic code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module definition with import statements and metadata comments. It does not process any user input, handle environment variables, or perform any system modifications. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, serving as a library interface for image similarity functions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It solely exports functions from a local submodule, with no suspicious elements.",
