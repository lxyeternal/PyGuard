{
  "purpose": "The code defines metadata and imports functions related to SSIMULACRA2, a structural similarity analysis tool.",
  "sources": "Metadata comments, version string, and import statements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; no sinks that handle external data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; no untrusted data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward module setup with imports and metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code only includes licensing information, a version identifier, a module docstring, and import statements for functions from a local module. There are no indications of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or obfuscated logic. The structure and content are consistent with a typical Python package initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
