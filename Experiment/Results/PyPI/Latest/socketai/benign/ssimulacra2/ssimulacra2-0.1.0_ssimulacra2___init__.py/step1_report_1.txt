  "purpose": "Defines module metadata and exports functions for SSIMULACRA2 image quality analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from the local module '.ssimulacra2'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; the code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only module metadata, licensing information, versioning, and explicit imports/exports. There are no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious operations. All imported functions are from a local module, and no external inputs or untrusted data handling is evident. No obfuscation or malicious intent is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines the module's interface and metadata.",
