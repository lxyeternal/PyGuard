{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a package initialization file that imports functions related to SSIMULACRA2, a method for image quality assessment based on structural similarity metrics.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module metadata and imports functions from a local module (.ssimulacra2). It does not read external data or inputs.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks such as network communication, file writing, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up imports and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs. It contains SPDX license identifiers and version info, typical for open-source modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module initialization script. It specifies licensing information, version, and imports specific functions from a local module, exposing them via __all__. There are no hidden, malicious, or suspicious behaviors. No external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no apparent security issues are present. The structure and content are consistent with standard Python package modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package initializer, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to expose selected functions from a local module. There is no evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
