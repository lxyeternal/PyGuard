{
  "purpose": "The code defines metadata and exports functions related to SSIMULACRA2, a module for image similarity analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads metadata (copyright, license, version) and imports functions from a local module (.ssimulacra2).",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause harm.",
  "flows": "The code does not process any external data; it only imports functions and sets module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward and primarily consists of metadata and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple, importing two functions from a local module and setting metadata variables. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used. The SPDX license identifiers and copyright statements are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The absence of dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns suggests no malicious behavior. The functions themselves are not shown, so their security cannot be assessed, but the current code fragment is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It mainly serves as an interface for other parts of the project.",
