  "purpose": "Implementation of SSIMULACRA2 perceptual image quality metric, including color space conversions, multi-scale analysis, and image comparison functions.",
  "sources": "Image files loaded from specified file paths; reading image data via PIL's Image.open and np.array conversions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that directly process untrusted data beyond image loading; no network operations, file writes, or external calls observed.",
  "flows": "Image data flows from file loading → color conversions and transformations → multi-scale analysis and SSIM computation → final score output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; code appears to perform standard image processing. The functions are straightforward, with no unusual control flow or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs color space conversion, image downsampling, blurring, and SSIM calculations in a typical manner. All functions rely on standard libraries (numpy, scipy, PIL) and implement known algorithms without obfuscation. No network, file modification, or data exfiltration code present. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. The image processing pipeline appears legitimate and aligns with known perceptual similarity metrics. The code includes detailed commentaries and structured processing steps, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of SSIMULACRA2 with standard image processing techniques. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It performs perceptual image quality assessment through well-understood algorithms. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
