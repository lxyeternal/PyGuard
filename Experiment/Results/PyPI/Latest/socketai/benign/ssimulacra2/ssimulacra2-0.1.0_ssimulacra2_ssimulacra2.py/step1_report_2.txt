  "purpose": "Implementation of SSIMULACRA2 image quality assessment metric in Python, including color space conversions, multi-scale analysis, and alpha blending.",
  "sources": "Image files loaded via PIL's Image.open; pixel data extracted with numpy array conversions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks if image data contains sensitive information; no direct sinks for untrusted data manipulations identified.",
  "flows": "Image input -> conversion to numpy array -> alpha blending -> color space conversion -> multi-scale analysis -> final score computation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard image processing operations. The weights array for scoring appears large but is a fixed parameter set; no obfuscation or unusual control flows observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image processing tasks including color space conversion, blurring, downsampling, and similarity metric calculations. No network operations, system commands, or file manipulations beyond image loading are present. The only potential concern could be if the images contain sensitive data; however, this is typical for image quality assessment. The weights array is large but static, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation is evident. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a perceptual quality metric without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of the SSIMULACRA2 image quality metric with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs standard image processing and quality scoring functions without engaging in network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors.",
