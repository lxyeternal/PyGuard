  "purpose": "Implementation of SSIMULACRA2 for perceptual image similarity measurement.",
  "sources": "Image input files, reading pixel data, static weights array for parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no network or file output, no external command execution.",
  "flows": "Image files -> pixel data -> color space conversions -> multi-scale SSIM calculations -> final score.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image processing tasks: sRGB to linear conversion, color space transformation, multi-scale SSIM computation, and no external or malicious activity. Static parameters are typical for such metrics. No obfuscation or backdoors are present. The static weights and parameters are known and legitimate. The functions are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or network activity. The malware score is appropriately 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1), justified by the handling of potentially sensitive images but not indicating vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of SSIMULACRA2 with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are consistent and appropriate.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
