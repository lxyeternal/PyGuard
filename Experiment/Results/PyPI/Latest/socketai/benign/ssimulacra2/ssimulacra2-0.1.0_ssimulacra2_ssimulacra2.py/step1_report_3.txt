{
  "purpose": "Implement SSIMULACRA2 perceptual image quality metric for comparing original and distorted images, including color space conversions, multi-scale analysis, and alpha blending.",
  "sources": "File reading images via PIL.Image.open, reading image files specified by orig_path and dist_path.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that send untrusted data externally or execute untrusted code; the code performs image processing operations only.",
  "flows": "Image files are loaded, potentially blended with backgrounds, converted to linear RGB, then to XYB space, followed by multi-scale SSIM computations and downsampling steps.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is present. The code's structure and functions appear standard for an image quality metric.",
  "analysis": "The script loads images from disk, processes them through color space conversions, applies blurring and downsampling, and computes SSIM maps. All operations are standard image processing steps. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration. Functions like 'alpha_blend', 'downsample', and 'blur_image' perform typical image manipulations. No hardcoded credentials, system calls, or suspicious external interactions are present. The code only manipulates image data internally.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an image quality metric (SSIMULACRA2) without malicious intent or security risks. It relies solely on standard image processing libraries and techniques, with no indications of malware or sabotage.",
