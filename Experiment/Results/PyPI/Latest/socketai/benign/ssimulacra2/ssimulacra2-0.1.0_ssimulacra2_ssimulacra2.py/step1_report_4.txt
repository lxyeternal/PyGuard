  "purpose": "Implementation of the SSIMULACRA2 perceptual similarity metric for image comparison, including color space conversions, multi-scale analysis, and optional alpha blending.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from disk via Image.open() and loads pixel data using numpy.array().",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data, no network operations or file writing observed.",
  "flows": "Image files are loaded, converted from sRGB to linear RGB, then to XYB, processed through multi-scale analysis with Gaussian blurring and SSIM computations, culminating in a score calculation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected. The weights in the scoring function are lengthy but appear to be static constants from the original implementation. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or secret data handling is present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly performs image processing and quality assessment operations. It reads images from disk, processes color space conversions, applies Gaussian blurring, and computes SSIM-like metrics at multiple scales. No network communication, no writing to files, and no suspicious data leaks or backdoors are present. All constants and operations appear to be standard and consistent with the intended purpose. The functions handle alpha blending for transparency and process images in a manner consistent with the described metric. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a perceptual image similarity metric without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs necessary computations for SSIMULACRA2, relying on well-understood libraries like numpy, scipy, and PIL. No malicious code, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
