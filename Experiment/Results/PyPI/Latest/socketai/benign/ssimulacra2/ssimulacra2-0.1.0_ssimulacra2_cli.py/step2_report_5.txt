  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The script is a CLI wrapper for SSIMULACRA2, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Code confirmation:** The provided code matches the description. It performs argument parsing, file existence checks, calls an external function, and outputs scores.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The report's scores are consistent.\n- **Risk justification:** No issues, the code is straightforward and safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Code confirmation:** The code logic matches the description. No anomalies.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None found.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The report's scores are appropriate.\n- **Risk justification:** The script is a benign CLI wrapper.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard CLI for image quality assessment, no suspicious activity.\n- **Code confirmation:** Consistent with the code provided.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. The slight securityRisk score reflects minimal concern, perhaps due to reliance on an external function.\n- **Justification for securityRisk=0.1:** Since the core computation is delegated to an external function whose implementation isn't shown, a small risk score might be assigned to account for potential vulnerabilities in that dependency, but overall, the script itself is safe.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which is justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Code confirmation:** Matches the code provided.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The report's scores are consistent.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as others, straightforward CLI wrapper.\n- **Code confirmation:** Consistent.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. Slightly higher risk score, possibly due to the external function's unspecified implementation.\n- **Justification:** Since the external function is a black box, a small security risk is assigned, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malware.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports are 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1-0.2, justified by reliance on external code whose security isn't verified here.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- The code appears to be a benign CLI wrapper for an image quality metric.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity is present.\n- The minor security risk scores assigned in some reports are reasonable, considering potential issues in external dependencies, but the core script is safe.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a small residual risk due to reliance on external code, but nothing malicious in the script itself)\n- **Obfuscated:** Confirmed as 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The small security risk score is justified given the dependency on external code whose integrity isn't verified here.",
