  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for SSIMULACRA2 image quality assessment function, handling input validation and output formatting.",
  "sources": "User-provided file paths for original and distorted images; external function compute_ssimulacra2_with_alpha",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows to external systems or network",
  "flows": "Input file paths -> external function call -> score output",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs argument parsing, checks file existence, calls an external trusted function, and outputs the score with interpretation. No malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity is present. External dependency is a black box but assumed trustworthy. No data leaks or vulnerabilities are evident. The code is straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI wrapper for an image quality metric, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. External dependency trust is assumed but not verified, leading to a minimal security concern. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
