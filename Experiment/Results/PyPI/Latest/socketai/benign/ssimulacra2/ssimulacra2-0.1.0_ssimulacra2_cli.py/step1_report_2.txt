  "purpose": "Command-line interface for calculating SSIMULACRA2 score between two images.",
  "sources": "User inputs for image file paths ('original', 'distorted'), file existence checks.",
  "sinks": "compute_ssimulacra2_with_alpha function call, print statements for output and errors.",
  "flows": "Input paths -> file existence verification -> function call with paths -> output score -> optional descriptive output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No external network connections, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles user input via command-line arguments, checks for file existence, and calls an external function 'compute_ssimulacra2_with_alpha'. The output is printed directly to standard output. No data leaks, environment variable misuse, or unsafe code execution present. The code performs expected operations with standard Python modules. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware are evident. The external function call is a black box, but its usage appears legitimate for the purpose described.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward command-line utility for image quality assessment with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
