  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward CLI wrapper for an image quality assessment function (`compute_ssimulacra2_with_alpha`).\n- No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The external function `compute_ssimulacra2_with_alpha` is assumed to be legitimate, but its implementation is not provided—this is a black box.\n- The code performs standard file existence checks, error handling, and outputs scores and interpretations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Discrepancies:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the described purpose: input validation, calling an external function, outputting scores, and interpretation.\n- **Malicious code or backdoors:** None detected in the code snippets or reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Network activity:** Not present.\n- **Sensitive data leaks:** None apparent.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None identified, as the code handles inputs safely and performs standard operations.\n\n---\n\n### Issue Scores & Justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis. No malware activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk scores:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1 or 0.2). Given the code's simplicity and lack of external network operations, these seem reasonable. Slight variations (0.1 vs. 0.2) are acceptable, possibly reflecting minor concerns about the external dependency, but nothing serious.\n\n### Validity of the reports' conclusions:\n\n- The reports' reasoning is sound. They correctly identify that the script is a CLI wrapper with no malicious behavior.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate, given the limited code scope and external dependency black box.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Code issues:** None found.\n- **Malware risk:** 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Given the simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities, a risk score of **0.1** (or 0) would be appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Recommendations:**\n\n- The code is secure and behaves as expected.\n- No changes needed for the scores; current assessments are reasonable.\n- The only potential concern is the external function `compute_ssimulacra2_with_alpha`, but without its implementation, we assume it is safe, especially given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Final suggestion:**\n\n| Metric            | Score | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| malware           | 0      | No malicious activity detected                               |\n| obfuscated        | 0      | No obfuscation present                                       |\n| security risk     | 0.1    | Minimal, mostly due to external dependency (assumed safe)  |\n\n**Overall, the code appears benign and well-structured.**",
