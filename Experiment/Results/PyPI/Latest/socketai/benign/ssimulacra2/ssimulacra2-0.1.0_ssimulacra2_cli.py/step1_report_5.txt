  "purpose": "Command-line interface for computing SSIMULACRA2 scores between two images.",
  "sources": "Input file paths provided via command-line arguments, specifically 'original' and 'distorted'.",
  "sinks": "Calls to compute_ssimulacra2_with_alpha function with file paths; output to standard output and error streams.",
  "flows": "Input paths -> check existence -> pass to compute_ssimulacra2_with_alpha -> output score to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. All external calls are limited to the imported function.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily serves as a CLI wrapper that verifies file existence and then invokes an imported function to perform the main computation. It includes standard input validation, error handling, and user guidance output. There are no signs of malicious data handling, code injection, or data exfiltration. The use of external function 'compute_ssimulacra2_with_alpha' appears legitimate within this context, and no suspicious network or system behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward CLI utility for image quality assessment. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are identified. It performs expected validation and output operations without suspicious behavior.",
