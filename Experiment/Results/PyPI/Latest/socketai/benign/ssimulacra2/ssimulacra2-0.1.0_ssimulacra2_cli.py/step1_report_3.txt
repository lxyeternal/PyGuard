  "purpose": "Command-line interface for SSIMULACRA2 to compare image quality metrics.",
  "sources": "Input paths for original and distorted images, user arguments.",
  "sinks": "File existence checks, output to stdout/stderr, function call to compute_ssimulacra2_with_alpha.",
  "flows": "User input paths -> file existence validation -> function call to compute SSIMULACRA2 -> output display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. No obfuscated code present. No network activity or system modification observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard command-line argument parsing, validates file existence, calls a presumably safe external function for image quality measurement, and outputs results. It does not process or leak untrusted data beyond input file paths, nor does it perform any network or system modifications. The function 'compute_ssimulacra2_with_alpha' is imported from a local module and appears to handle core computation; its implementation is not provided but is not inherently suspicious from the usage here.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical CLI wrapper around an image quality metric, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is straightforward, with no hidden or malicious operations detected.",
