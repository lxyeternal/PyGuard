  "purpose": "Command-line interface for computing SSIMULACRA2 scores between images",
  "sources": "User-provided image file paths via command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "Potential use of image paths for reading files; outputting score and error messages",
  "flows": "Input paths -> file existence check -> score computation -> output score and interpretation",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles command-line arguments, checks for file existence, calls an external function to compute an image similarity score, and then outputs the result and interpretation. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious operations are evident. The use of 'compute_ssimulacra2_with_alpha' is assumed to be a trusted, external dependency for image quality assessment. The script does not process or leak sensitive data, nor does it contain code injection, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. All operations are standard for a CLI tool for image analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward CLI interface for an image quality assessment tool. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It securely handles file paths, performs standard checks, and outputs results accordingly.",
