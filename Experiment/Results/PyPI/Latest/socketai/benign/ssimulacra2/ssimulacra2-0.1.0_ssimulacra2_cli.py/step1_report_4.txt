  "purpose": "Command-line interface for evaluating image quality using SSIMULACRA2.",
  "sources": "Reads image file paths from command-line arguments; checks file existence.",
  "sinks": "Potentially calls 'compute_ssimulacra2_with_alpha' which may process images; outputs scores to stdout.",
  "flows": "User inputs file paths -> code checks existence -> calls 'compute_ssimulacra2_with_alpha' -> outputs score and interpretation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no obfuscated code features; no network activity or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles argument parsing, file existence validation, and calling an external function to compute image similarity scores. It outputs the score and an interpretation guide. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling is evident. The 'compute_ssimulacra2_with_alpha' function, imported from a module, is a potential source of processing but is not detailed here; assuming it is a legitimate image quality metric implementation. The script does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward command-line utility for image quality assessment with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
