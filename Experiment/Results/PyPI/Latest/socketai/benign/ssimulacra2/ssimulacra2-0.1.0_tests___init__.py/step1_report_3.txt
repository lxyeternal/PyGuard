  "purpose": "The code contains only SPDX license and copyright comments, indicating licensing information.",
  "sources": "No executable code or data input points present.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, output, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing paths since there is no executable code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only license comments without any executable or imported code, which is unusual for a functional source file.",
  "analysis": "The file consists solely of SPDX license identifiers and copyright notices. There are no functions, variables, imports, or executable statements. This minimal content suggests it serves as metadata or licensing information only. No malicious code, data input/output points, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The absence of code limits the possibility of malicious behavior or security risks. The structure is clean and typical for license header files, but lacking any actual code logic.",
  "conclusion": "This source file contains only license and copyright comments with no executable or data-handling code. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior concerns.",
