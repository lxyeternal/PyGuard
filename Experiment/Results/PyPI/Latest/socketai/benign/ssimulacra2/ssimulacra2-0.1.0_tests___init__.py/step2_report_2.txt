  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \nAll reports confirm that the code contains only comments with SPDX license identifiers and copyright notices. There are no executable statements, data flows, or external communications. Therefore, **no issues are present** in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the file is purely informational and contains no malicious or suspicious code. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the lack of executable or complex code.  \n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, aligning with the absence of any malicious activity.  \n- **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Higher Risk Scores**:  \nSince there is no executable code, no data handling, and no suspicious patterns, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The code is benign.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \nAll reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \nNo questionable assumptions are present; the reports are based on the actual content, which is just comments.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \nThe scores are consistent with the content of the files.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — No obfuscation; only comments.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risk, no executable code, no vulnerabilities.\n\n### Summary:\nThe files are benign license headers with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: If I were to assign my own estimates based on the overall content, I would concur with the existing scores:\n\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThese are appropriate given the absence of any executable or suspicious content.",
