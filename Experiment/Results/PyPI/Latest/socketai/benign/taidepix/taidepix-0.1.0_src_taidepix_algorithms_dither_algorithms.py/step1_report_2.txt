  "purpose": "Provide various dithering algorithms for image processing.",
  "sources": "Input image data obtained through the PIL Image object passed to each method.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions write untrusted data to external sources or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Image data flows from the PIL Image input to numpy array conversion, processing via dithering algorithms, then back to PIL Image output.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard image processing techniques without any obfuscated or suspicious code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden data flows are present. All processing appears to be straightforward image manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines multiple static methods for different dithering algorithms, all of which process input images by converting them to numpy arrays, applying well-known dithering techniques, and returning processed images. There are no network communications, file operations, or environment variable manipulations. The code uses numpy for calculations, which is standard for image processing. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The print statements are benign and only indicate processing steps.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of standard image dithering algorithms with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for use from a security perspective.",
