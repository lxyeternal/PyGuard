  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some data processing or functionality related to a Python package, but without additional context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input sources include any environment variables, imported modules, or user inputs (though none are explicitly shown here).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be network calls, file writes, or execution functions, but none are evident in this fragment.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows identified within the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no obvious anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns. It appears straightforward and uses standard Python syntax.",
  "analysis": "The provided code fragment is minimal or absent, offering no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. Since the code does not include any network activity, eval calls, or data leaks, it appears benign. The lack of context or detailed code limits a thorough assessment, but nothing suspicious is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no indication of malicious behavior, malware, or significant security risks. The code appears benign, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
