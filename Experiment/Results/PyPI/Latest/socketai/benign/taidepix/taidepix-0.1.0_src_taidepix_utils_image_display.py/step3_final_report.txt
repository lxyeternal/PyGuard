  "purpose": "Convert images into various terminal display formats (ASCII, block, braille, color).",
  "sources": "Image data obtained via img.getdata(), input parameters for width, charset, and color mode.",
  "sinks": "Generated ASCII or Unicode characters, ANSI escape sequences for color, terminal output.",
  "flows": "Image pixels -> resized image -> pixel data -> character mapping or ANSI codes -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import 'sys' and 'taidepix.algorithms.dither_algorithms' which are not utilized in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image processing and terminal rendering without network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. No secrets or malicious payloads are present. The unused import is benign. The use of ANSI escape sequences and Unicode braille characters is typical for terminal graphics and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for image display in terminal environments. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor unused import does not impact security. The overall security risk is negligible, and malware likelihood is zero.",
