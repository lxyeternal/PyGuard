{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to convert images into ASCII, block, or braille representations for display purposes, with optional color support.",
  "sources": "The code reads image data via the PIL Image object passed to 'image_display', and input parameters such as 'width', 'charset', and 'color'.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs formatted strings representing images, primarily to be displayed in a terminal or console. It does not send data over network or write to files.",
  "flows": "Input image data -> resized and processed according to display mode -> conversion to ASCII, braille, or colored output -> formatted string output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. Usage of ANSI escape codes and Unicode braille characters is for display purposes only. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manipulates image data for visual representation in terminal format. It uses standard libraries and straightforward image processing steps such as resizing and pixel iteration. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity is present. The functions are purely for display formatting without external data transmission or system modification.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for rendering images as text-based graphics in terminals. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious activities such as data exfiltration or system compromise.",
