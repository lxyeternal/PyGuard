{
  "purpose": "The code loads an image from a specified file path, converts it to RGB mode, and optionally resizes it.",
  "sources": "Reads input file path from the function argument and the image file on disk.",
  "sinks": "Uses Image.open to read image data; no untrusted data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "Input path -> Image.open -> convert('RGB') -> optional resize -> return image",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. No obfuscated or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs image loading and processing using the Pillow library. It takes a file path as input, opens the image, converts to RGB, and optionally resizes. It handles exceptions by printing an error message and exiting. There are no suspicious or malicious operations such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions for image handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard image loading with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
