  "purpose": "Load an image from a specified path, convert it to RGB, and optionally resize it.",
  "sources": "The code reads the image file from the provided 'path'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input path -> Image.open() -> convert('RGB') -> optional resize -> return image",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements and exit(1) on exception; no malicious or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image loading and processing with exception handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The use of exit(1) is typical error handling, not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for image loading with no security concerns or malicious intent. Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (due to process termination on error, which is standard).",
