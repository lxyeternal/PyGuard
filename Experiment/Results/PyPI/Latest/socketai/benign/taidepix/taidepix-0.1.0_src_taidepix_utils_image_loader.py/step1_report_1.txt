  "purpose": "Load an image from a specified path, convert it to RGB mode, and optionally resize it.",
  "sources": "The 'path' parameter used in Image.open(path).",
  "sinks": "The Image.open() function reading from the file system; the exit(1) call terminating the process.",
  "flows": "Input 'path' -> Image.open(path) -> convert('RGB') -> optional resize -> return image.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for logging; abrupt exit on exception which might hide errors but is not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads an image file from a user-specified path, converts it to RGB, and optionally resizes it. It handles exceptions by printing an error and terminating. The functions used are standard image processing calls; no malicious or suspicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. No obfuscation or malicious intent identified. The exit() on error is a basic error handling method but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard image loading utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs legitimate file input operations and image processing without any suspicious activities.",
