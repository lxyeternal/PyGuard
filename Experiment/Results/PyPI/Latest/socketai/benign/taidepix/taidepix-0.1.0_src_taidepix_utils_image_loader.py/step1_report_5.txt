{
  "purpose": "Load an image from a specified path, convert it to RGB, and optionally resize it.",
  "sources": "The 'path' parameter passed to the load_image function; the 'size' parameter for resizing.",
  "sinks": "Image.open() for file reading; potential printing of error messages.",
  "flows": "Input 'path' is used by Image.open() to load the file; optional resize operation modifies the image object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The print statement for debugging is benign in this context; exception handling uses exit(1), which is standard error handling. No suspicious network activity or malicious code evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to load and process an image file, utilizing the Pillow library. It accepts a file path and optional size, loads the image, converts it to RGB, and resizes if requested. Error handling is implemented via try-except, printing errors and terminating the program. The code performs standard image processing tasks without any embedded malicious behavior or unusual patterns. No external data leaks, network communication, or suspicious operations are present. The use of exit(1) is typical for fatal errors but not inherently malicious. Overall, the code appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard image loading and processing function with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected operations using the Pillow library, with proper error handling. No malicious or suspicious behaviors detected.",
