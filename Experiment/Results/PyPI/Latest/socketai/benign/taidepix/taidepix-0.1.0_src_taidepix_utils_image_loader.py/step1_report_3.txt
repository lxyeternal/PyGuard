{
  "purpose": "The function loads an image from a specified path, converts it to RGB, and optionally resizes it.",
  "sources": "Reads the image file from the provided 'path' parameter.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'Image.open' to read data; no untrusted data is sent elsewhere. No network or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "flows": "Input path -> Image.open -> convert to 'RGB' -> optional resize -> return image object.",
  "anomalies": "The only potential concern is the 'exit(1)' in exception handling, which terminates the program but is not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Pillow library to handle image files. It loads an image from a given path, converts it to RGB mode, and optionally resizes it. Error handling involves printing an error message and exiting the program upon failure. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious data handling. No network activity or data exfiltration observed. The code is straightforward and typical for image processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard image loading utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs simple, expected operations without any suspicious behaviors.",
