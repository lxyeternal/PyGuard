{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to load an image, apply dithering algorithms, and display the result in the terminal using specified character sets and options.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the command line arguments, specifically 'image_path' and other options, and from the 'load_image' function which loads the image from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs ASCII art to the terminal via print, which is generally benign. No network operations, file writes, or external data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments flows into image loading and processing functions. The image data flows from 'load_image' to image conversion and dithering functions, then to display functions, ending with terminal output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No unusual or suspicious code constructs are present. The image loading, processing, and display appear standard. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports well-known modules for argument parsing, image processing, and display. It uses a static mapping for dithering algorithms and handles errors gracefully. All operations are typical for an image processing CLI tool. No network communication, file writing, or other risky behavior observed. The code is straightforward and employs standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and intended for legitimate image dithering and display purposes. No malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are evident based on this review.",
