  "purpose": "This script loads an image, applies dithering algorithms, and displays the result as ASCII art in the terminal.",
  "sources": "Reads the image path from command line arguments, loads the image via taidepix.utils.image_loader.load_image, and retrieves user options from command line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses load_image function to read the image, passes images to image_display for output, and uses sys.exit on error conditions.",
  "flows": "Command line argument parsing -> load_image() -> image_display() -> print()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code handles errors gracefully and uses external libraries appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code securely loads an image file based on user input and applies standard dithering algorithms, which are selected via user options. No user input is directly executed as code, and external dependencies appear to be standard and properly used. Error handling is minimal but appropriate. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors. The script is a typical image processing utility with no obfuscated or suspicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign image processing script with no malicious intent or malicious behavior detected. It performs expected operations securely, with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
