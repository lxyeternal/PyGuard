{
  "purpose": "The code loads an image, applies a dithering algorithm, and displays it as ASCII art or with color in the terminal.",
  "sources": "Reads the image path from command line arguments, loads image data via load_image function.",
  "sinks": "Outputs ASCII art to the terminal; no untrusted data sinks evident beyond standard output.",
  "flows": "Input: image_path argument -> load_image -> optional grayscale conversion -> dithering -> display with image_display -> print output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, no network connections, or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard image processing tasks: loading images, converting to grayscale, applying dithering algorithms, and displaying results. All imported modules appear related to image processing and display, with no indication of malicious intent. No suspicious code, external network calls, or backdoors are present. The logic flow is straightforward, focusing on image manipulation and terminal display. No anomalies or signs of obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign image dithering and display utility with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
