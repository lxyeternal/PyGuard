  "purpose": "A straightforward CLI utility for loading an image, applying dithering algorithms, and displaying the result in the terminal as ASCII or colored output.",
  "sources": "Image file specified by 'image_path' argument, loaded via 'load_image'.",
  "sinks": "Display output via 'image_display', which renders ASCII art or colored images in the terminal.",
  "flows": "Input image path -> load_image -> (convert to grayscale if dithering) -> apply selected dithering algorithm -> display image via image_display.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Error handling is minimal but appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign image processing CLI tool with no network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution. It imports legitimate libraries, handles errors gracefully, and performs expected operations. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's structure and logic are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, standard image dithering utility with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: approximately 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign analysis. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
