  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple comment describing algorithms related to data manipulation and analysis.",
  "sources": "No data sources or input methods are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists due to lack of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a comment line with no executable instructions, no suspicious or unusual patterns, and no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a single comment statement describing algorithms for data manipulation and analysis. There are no function definitions, data inputs, outputs, or executable logic. No potential security issues, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present. The absence of code means there are no source-to-sink flows or anomalies to analyze.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-executable comment and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a placeholder or descriptive comment only.",
