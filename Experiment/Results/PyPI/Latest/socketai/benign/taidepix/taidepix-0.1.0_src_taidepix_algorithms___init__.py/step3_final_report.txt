  "purpose": "This code serves as a descriptive comment or docstring outlining algorithms for data manipulation and analysis.",
  "sources": "There are no data sources; the code is only a comment or documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data flows are present, as the code contains only comments.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code does not process or handle any input or output.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious indicators; the code is purely descriptive.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments or docstrings with no executable instructions, data handling, or logic. All reviews correctly identify the content as benign documentation. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the content. Confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty that the code is non-executable and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign comments or documentation with no executable or malicious content. All reports are accurate, and the overall security risk is negligible. No further action is necessary.",
