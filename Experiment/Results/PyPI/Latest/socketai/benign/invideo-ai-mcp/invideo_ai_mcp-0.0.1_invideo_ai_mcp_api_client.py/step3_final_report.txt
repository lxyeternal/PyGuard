{
  "purpose": "A well-structured, asynchronous Python API client for interacting with the InVideo AI platform, providing models for various content operations and methods for API communication.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (e.g., prompt, topic, script, etc.), response data from API endpoints",
  "sinks": "API request payloads constructed from function inputs; response data processed and returned as validated models",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> API request payloads -> HTTP requests -> API responses -> response validation -> returned models",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; standard request/response handling",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard async HTTP requests with proper headers, error handling, and response validation using pydantic. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation are present. The request data is derived from function parameters, and responses are validated against defined models, with errors properly caught and reported. The structure and logic follow best practices for API clients, with no suspicious patterns or insecure coding practices observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented API client with no malicious or suspicious elements. It handles data securely, validates responses, and does not contain obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. The security risk and malware scores are justified as zero, with a very low overall risk score (~0.1). The assessments across all reports are accurate and consistent.",
