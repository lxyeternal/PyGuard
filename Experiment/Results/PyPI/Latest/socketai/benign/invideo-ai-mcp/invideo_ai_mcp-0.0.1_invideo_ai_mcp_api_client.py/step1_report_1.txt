{
  "purpose": "The code implements an asynchronous Python client for interacting with the InVideo AI API, providing models and methods for generating topics, narrative options, content ideas, scripts, and videos.",
  "sources": "User input parameters for API requests (e.g., topic, platform, script, etc.), environment data (package version via importlib.metadata), and configuration data such as API host.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external API endpoints, responses returned from these API calls, and the data used in request payloads (e.g., scripts, topics).",
  "flows": "User inputs → API request payloads → HTTP requests → API responses → response validation and transformation → return MCP response objects.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically constructs request data from function parameters without evident validation or sanitization, but no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models and an asynchronous API client class that interacts with the InVideo API. It properly manages headers and requests, includes error handling for network and HTTP errors, and validates responses using Pydantic models. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful actions. It merely forwards data to and from a trusted external API, with no indication of insecure data handling. The API interaction methods are standard, and no suspicious behaviors like code injection, hidden network activity, or credential theft are apparent. The client constructs requests from user-provided parameters, but no insecure practices like evaluating user input as code are present. Overall, the code appears to be a typical, well-structured API client without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client implementation for interacting with the InVideo AI API. It contains no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It follows good practices for error handling and response validation. The overall security risk is very low.",
