  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code to determine the accuracy of their conclusions, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any potential risks are underestimated or overestimated.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a well-structured, asynchronous Python API client for InVideo's AI services.\n- It uses standard libraries (httpx, pydantic, importlib.metadata).\n- It handles request construction, response validation, error handling, and data transformation.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The request data is built from user parameters without evident validation issues.\n- The response models and request handling are straightforward and follow best practices.\n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration are visible.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Describes the code as an async client for InVideo API.\n- Findings: No malicious code, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior.\n- Analysis: Correctly notes the code's standard structure, proper validation, and error handling.\n- Conclusion: Very low security risk, malware score 0.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The report aligns well with the code's content. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar overview.\n- Findings: No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Correctly identifies standard practices, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Low risk, malware score 0.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The reasoning and scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same general description.\n- Findings: No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Appropriately notes standard async HTTP handling, response validation, and no malicious signs.\n- Conclusion: Low security risk, malware score 0.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The scores and reasoning are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Consistent overview.\n- Findings: No suspicious code, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Properly recognizes the code as a typical API client with standard practices.\n- Conclusion: Low risk, malware score 0.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same general overview.\n- Findings: No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- Analysis: Recognizes the code as a legitimate API client with standard practices.\n- Conclusion: Low risk, malware score 0.\n- Confidence: 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Overall evaluation:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, scores around 0.1-0.2 are reasonable.\n- **Response validation and handling:** Properly implemented.\n- **Request data:** Built from user parameters without evident issues.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None based on the code; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n- No modifications needed; the assessments are aligned with the code content.\n- The overall security posture of this code is very low risk.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to external API dependency, not code itself)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured API client with no signs of malicious activity or security concerns.",
