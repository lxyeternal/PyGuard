  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk, and compare these assessments with the code.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Describes a typical async API client with models and request handling.\n- Findings: No malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (very low)\n- Conclusion: The code is a standard, well-structured API client with minimal risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. No issues identified. The malware and obfuscation scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar description—API client for InVideo.\n- Findings: No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n- Conclusion: No signs of malicious activity; standard practices.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No red flags.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same general API client functionality.\n- Findings: No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2 (still very low)\n- Conclusion: Legitimate client, no malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** The assessment appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as above—API interaction.\n- Findings: No suspicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n- Conclusion: Well-structured, safe code.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same, API client.\n- Findings: No malicious code, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard implementation.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code's content. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious code execution.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscated code.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the code's straightforward nature, the low security risk scores are appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code is a standard API client with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The response validation and error handling are proper.\n- The request payloads are built from user input without evident sanitization issues, but this is typical for such clients; actual server-side validation is assumed.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard API client)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code appears safe and well-implemented from a security perspective.",
