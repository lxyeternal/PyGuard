{
  "purpose": "The code provides a client interface for interacting with the InVideo API, facilitating operations like generating topics, narratives, content ideas, scripts, and videos, primarily for video content creation.",
  "sources": "HTTP request functions (_make_request, _handle_api_request), environment variables (importlib.metadata for version), user inputs via method parameters (category, topic, script, etc.)",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external API endpoints, JSON response processing, and data handling in response models",
  "flows": "Inputs (parameters, environment/version info) -> API request via _make_request -> response validation and transformation -> return of MCP response objects",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; standard use of async HTTP client; straightforward request-response flow; no suspicious data leaks or privacy violations observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models with Pydantic, handles API requests asynchronously via httpx, and processes responses into structured MCP response classes. It securely manages headers, including a user-agent with version info obtained from package metadata. No evidence of code injection, malicious data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions primarily handle data fetching and transformation, with proper exception handling for network errors and API errors. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated patterns are present. The code follows standard practices for API client development.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client for InVideo's services. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on the visible code. It functions as intended for API communication, with appropriate error handling and data validation. The overall security risk is low.",
