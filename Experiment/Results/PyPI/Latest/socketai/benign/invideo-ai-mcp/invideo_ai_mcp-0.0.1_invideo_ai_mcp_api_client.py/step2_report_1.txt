  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code to identify any inconsistencies, potential issues, or overestimations.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- A well-structured, async Python API client for InVideo, with models for various video content operations.\n- Uses standard libraries: httpx for HTTP, pydantic for data validation.\n- Handles errors appropriately.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- Request data is built from function parameters, responses are validated, and no malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Proper validation and error handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis aligns well with the code. The malware score is appropriately zero; no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; standard API client, no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard practices, no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, consistent. Slightly higher security risk score but still very low.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Findings:** Same observations; no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, standard practices.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nMatches the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Findings:** Same; no malicious activity, no obfuscation, standard API client.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Justification**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified. The code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and contains no suspicious or malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero but still very low, reflecting the fact that the code handles untrusted data via validation, does not contain secrets, and does not perform any suspicious operations.\n\n**Potential improvements:**\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable. No overestimation or underestimation is evident.\n- The code's security posture is very low risk, which matches the reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code or behaviors detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (very low, mainly due to external API interaction, which is standard)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and conservative. The code is a standard, well-structured API client with no signs of malicious activity. The scores are justified and should remain as they are.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores as they are; no changes necessary. The code is safe, and the assessments are appropriate.",
