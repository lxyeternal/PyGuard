  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a well-structured async API client with models, request handling, validation, and error management. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** The low security risk score is appropriate given the absence of suspicious behavior. The malware score of 0 is justified, as no malicious activity is present.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices, no suspicious patterns, and proper validation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — aligns with the findings.\n- **Justification:** The low risk and malware scores are justified. The code does not perform any suspicious actions.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard API client with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — slightly higher securityRisk, but still very low.\n- **Justification:** Slight increase in securityRisk score (from 0.1 to 0.2) is acceptable, perhaps reflecting cautious recognition of request handling, but overall still minimal.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as previous, with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score is justified; no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the absence of malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher securityRisk score is reasonable, but overall low.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's straightforward API client nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, as no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 or 0.2) are reasonable considering the code's request handling and data flow, but no significant security issues are indicated.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with the reports.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. No further adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-implemented API client with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided scores and reasoning are appropriate.",
