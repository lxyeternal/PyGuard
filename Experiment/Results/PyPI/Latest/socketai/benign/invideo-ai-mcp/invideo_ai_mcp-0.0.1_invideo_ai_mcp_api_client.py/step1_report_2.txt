{
  "purpose": "The code provides a client interface for interacting with the InVideo AI API, including generating topics, narratives, content ideas, scripts, and videos.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function parameters, API responses, and configuration during initialization (e.g., version info).",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data from API responses is used to instantiate response models. HTTP requests are made with potentially untrusted input in request payloads.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and API responses flow through request functions, validation, and transformation into response objects. API responses are validated and then mapped to internal response models.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code uses standard libraries and conventions. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are evident. No hidden backdoors or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard practices for API communication, including request handling, response validation, error handling, and data transformation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as network exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors. The request data is based on input parameters, and responses are validated via pydantic models. The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets or credentials. It properly manages the HTTP client lifecycle and encapsulates request logic. No malicious or suspicious patterns are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a well-structured API client for the InVideo platform, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided code. It operates within expected patterns for API interaction without evident malicious behaviors.",
