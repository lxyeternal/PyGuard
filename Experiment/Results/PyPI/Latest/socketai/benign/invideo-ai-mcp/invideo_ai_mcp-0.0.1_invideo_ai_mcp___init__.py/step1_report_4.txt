{
  "purpose": "This module appears to serve as an API client and server setup for interacting with the InVideo AI API, providing import statements and versioning information.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes and functions from external modules 'invvideo_ai_mcp.api_client' and 'invvideo_ai_mcp.server'. It does not read input or data directly.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted directly within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable within this minimal code, as it only performs imports and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal and straightforward. No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a simple module initializer, setting version information, importing necessary components, and defining the public API. No data processing, input handling, or network communication occurs here. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup file with no malicious intent or security issues. It only imports and exports certain components, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
