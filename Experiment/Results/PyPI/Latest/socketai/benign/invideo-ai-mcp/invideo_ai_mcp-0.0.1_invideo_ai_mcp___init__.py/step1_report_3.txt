  "purpose": "This code provides an API client and server setup for interacting with the InVideo AI API, mainly exporting modules and version info.",
  "sources": "Imports from invideo_ai_mcp.api_client and invideo_ai_mcp.server modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data handling is observed.",
  "flows": "Imports from external modules; no data flow from untrusted sources within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes module metadata, imports specific components from internal packages, and defines __all__ for exports. There are no code execution, data handling, or security-sensitive operations shown. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file or similar module setup. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard module initialization script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly sets up exports and version info without performing any data processing or external communication.",
