  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a minimal module that defines a version string, imports specific components from internal modules, and sets an `__all__` list.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior.\n- The code appears to be part of a larger package, likely an `__init__.py` or similar setup file, serving as an interface layer.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No, the code does not contain any vulnerabilities, malicious code, or anomalies. It is a benign module setup.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Logical flaws or mistakes?**  \n  No, the code is correct for its purpose. The reports' reasoning is sound.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware scores:**  \n  All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is consistent with the code analysis. No malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:**  \n  All assign `obfuscated: 0`, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk scores:**  \n  Most reports assign `securityRisk: 0` or very close to zero, which is justified given the code's benign nature.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- The highest `securityRisk` score is 0.1, which is still very low. This is acceptable because the code is purely an import/export module with no data handling.\n\n### Potential assumptions and claims:\n- The reports correctly identify that there are no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities based on this snippet.\n- No assumptions about external dependencies or behaviors are made beyond the visible code.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. No report overstates or understates the risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the code and the reports, I agree with the overall conclusion: **the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security issues.**  \nThe minimal nature of the code and the lack of data processing or external communication justify very low risk scores.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.05 (very low, just acknowledging it's a module setup, but no real risk)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is straightforward, safe, and contains no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero or near-zero levels.\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis is needed.",
