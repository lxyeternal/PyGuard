  "purpose": "Module initializer and API client/export setup for InVideo AI MCP",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules, version string definition",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, no external communication",
  "flows": "Import statements to module exports; no data flow or untrusted data handling",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; straightforward structure",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup, importing components and defining __all__. No runtime logic, data handling, or network activity present. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal nature and lack of external interactions confirm its benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or near-zero) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module setup with no malicious or security issues. The existing scores are accurate; minor risk score of 0.1 in some reports can be considered slightly conservative but acceptable.",
