  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, the exact purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, user inputs, or external files (if present). Specific source points are not explicitly visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Data could be sent over network connections, written to files, or used in subprocess calls. No explicit sinks are visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., environment variables or inputs) through processing functions, potentially reaching output or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are apparent. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and lacks indicators of malicious behavior such as system data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or hidden backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries appears normal. No dangerous patterns like unsafe SQL, code injection, or insecure randomness are evident. The structure and format are typical for standard Python scripts. Without additional context or external data sources, no malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code does not exhibit any signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the visible content. It appears to be a benign utility script with no evident malicious or suspicious activity.",
