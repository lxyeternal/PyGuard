  "purpose": "Define package metadata including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright information.",
  "sources": "None (no data input or external data reading occurs in this code fragment).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output, system calls, or external interactions are present).",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only assigns string and numeric values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Unicode characters in the __cake__ variable is unusual but harmless; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code sets metadata variables for a Python package, including title, description, URL, version, build number, author info, license, and copyright. The Unicode characters in __cake__ are decorative and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The code does not perform any external input/output, system modifications, or data processing that could introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard metadata assignment for a Python package and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be purely informational and decorative.",
