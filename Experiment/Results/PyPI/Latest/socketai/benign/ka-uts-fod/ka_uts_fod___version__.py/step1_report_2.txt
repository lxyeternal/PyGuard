  "purpose": "Define package metadata including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, copyright, and decorative unicode characters.",
  "sources": "Module-level variable assignments for metadata and unicode characters.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static metadata assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Unicode escape sequences for decorative purposes, but no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward static variable assignments representing package metadata, including title, description, URL, version, author details, license, and copyright. The only potentially notable aspect is the inclusion of Unicode characters for decoration, which is benign. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors present. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscation observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical metadata declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard package info file with harmless decorative unicode characters.",
