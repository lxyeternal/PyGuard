  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'ka_uts_fod' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "Constants and string assignments at the beginning of the module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns static metadata values",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code appears to be standard package metadata declarations without unusual or suspicious elements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments for package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright. All values are static strings or numbers. No input handling, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code patterns are observed. The code serves as a standard metadata declaration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical set of package metadata variables with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
