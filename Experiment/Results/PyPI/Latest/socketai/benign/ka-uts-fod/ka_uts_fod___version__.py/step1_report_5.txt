  "sinks": "None present; no data processing or output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this code only assigns metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; the code is straightforward metadata declarations with no unusual patterns or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of variable assignments for package metadata, including text and unicode characters. No user input handling, external data reading, or suspicious code constructs are present. The unicode string (__cake__) is benign and decorative. No dynamic execution, hardcoded credentials, or external calls are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard package metadata without any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It appears to be a typical setup or metadata file.",
