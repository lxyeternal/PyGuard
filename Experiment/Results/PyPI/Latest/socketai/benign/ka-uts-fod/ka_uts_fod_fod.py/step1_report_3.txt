{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility classes for flattening nested arrays and dictionaries into an array of dictionaries (AoD), mainly for data transformation and processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters such as 'arr', 'dic', 'd_meta', and 'd_flatten' passed to class methods; it also imports external modules 'ka_uts_aod.aod' and 'ka_uts_dic.dic'.",
  "sinks": "The code merges or transforms data using functions like 'AoD.merge_aod', 'AoD.merge_dic', and 'Dic.split_by_key', but does not directly write data to external sources, perform network operations, or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables (arrays, dictionaries, metadata) into processing functions, potentially transforming nested structures into flattened forms, and merges via 'AoD' and 'Dic' functions; no external untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code heavily relies on external 'AoD' and 'Dic' modules for merging and splitting, but without their source, potential malicious behavior cannot be entirely ruled out. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution observed. The commented import 'ka_uts_log.log' suggests potential logging, but it is inactive.",
  "analysis": "The code implements data flattening for arrays and dictionaries with clear recursive logic and data merging. It utilizes external modules for merging and splitting data, which could potentially contain malicious logic if those modules are compromised; however, within this code snippet, there are no indicators of malicious intent such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The functions perform standard data transformation tasks, with no network or system calls present. The code's purpose appears to be data normalization and flattening, with no signs of malicious behavior. The structure is standard, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code performs legitimate data flattening operations using external modules, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. Its functionality is typical for data processing, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are detected within this code fragment.",
