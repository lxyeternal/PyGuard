  "purpose": "Utility classes for flattening nested arrays and dictionaries into an abstract data object (AOD) format, with support for custom key handling and function application.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are arrays (arr) and dictionaries (dic) passed into class methods such as flatten_merge_to_aod, flattenx_keys, flattenx_merge_to_aod, flatten_to_aod, flatten, flatten_using_d2p, flattenx_to_aod, flattenx_using_d2p, and flattenx.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed internally; potential sinks include the application of custom functions (_fnc) via AoD.apply_function, and data merging via AoD.merge_aod and AoD.merge_dic. No untrusted external output or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (arrays/dictionaries) through recursive flattening and merging functions, with optional function application. Key paths involve passing data through flattening, merging, and transformation steps, culminating in the return of a flattened AOD.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code appears to perform standard data transformation. No signs of obfuscated code or malicious logic. Use of dynamic function application (_fnc) could be risky if _fnc is untrusted, but it is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for flattening complex nested data structures into an abstract format. It relies heavily on external modules (ka_uts_aod.aod and ka_uts_dic.dic) for core operations like merging and flattening. All data transformations are data-centric with no network or file I/O, and no suspicious commands or system interactions are present. The use of function application (_fnc) in AoD.apply_function could be exploited if externally supplied functions are untrusted, but within the context, it appears to be intended for customizable data processing. The code does not include any hardcoded secrets, credential leaks, or backdoors, nor does it perform any covert activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for data flattening and transformation, with no malicious intent or malicious code detected. It relies on external libraries for core functionality. The potential risk lies in the use of external functions (_fnc) which could be malicious if misused, but this is a common pattern. Overall, the code is safe and does not exhibit signs of malware or supply chain attacks.",
