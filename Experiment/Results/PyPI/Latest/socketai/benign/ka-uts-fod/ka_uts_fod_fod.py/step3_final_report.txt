{
  "purpose": "Provides utility classes and functions for flattening nested arrays and dictionaries, merging data, and applying functions to data structures.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are nested lists and dictionaries processed within class methods; external modules 'AoD' and 'Dic' are used for merging and transforming data.",
  "sinks": "Data is manipulated internally; no external sinks, network, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input structures through flattening and merging functions, with optional application of external functions via 'apply_function' in 'AoD'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'apply_function' which can execute arbitrary functions; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements data flattening and merging utilities with support for custom key handling and function application. The primary security concern is the use of 'apply_function', which could execute malicious code if 'fnc' is untrusted. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code relies on external modules assumed safe. The malware score is low (0.1) due to the potential misuse of dynamic function application, and the overall security risk is moderate (0.3). The code itself appears benign, serving as a utility for data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data transformation utilities with a minimal security concern related to dynamic function execution. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present. The low malware and moderate security risk scores are justified, but caution should be exercised if 'fnc' is supplied from untrusted sources.",
