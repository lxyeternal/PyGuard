{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization file, importing specific functions/classes from a local 'metrics' module and defining __all__ for export.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local '.metrics' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code does not process data or execute flows beyond imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three functions/classes from a local module and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The simplicity and standard pattern indicate no malicious intent or security risks. No obfuscation, malware, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
