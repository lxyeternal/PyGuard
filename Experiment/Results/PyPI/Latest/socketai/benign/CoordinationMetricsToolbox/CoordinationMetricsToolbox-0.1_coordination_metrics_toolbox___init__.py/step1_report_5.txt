{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions and classes from a local module named 'metrics' and defines the public API of the module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local 'metrics' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs imports and sets __all__.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. No suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three components from a relative module 'metrics' and defines the __all__ list for public API exposure. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no side effects. The code structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file. No indicators of malicious intent, such as code injection, data leakage, or backdoors, are present. The simplicity and standard pattern reduce the likelihood of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module initializer that imports specific functions and classes and defines public API exposure. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior. It is safe and typical for a Python package.",
