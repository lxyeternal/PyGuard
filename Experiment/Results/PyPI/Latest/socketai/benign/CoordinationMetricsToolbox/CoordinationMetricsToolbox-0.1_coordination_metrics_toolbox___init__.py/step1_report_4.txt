{
  "purpose": "The code exports specific functions and classes from the metrics module for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local metrics module: CoordinationMetrics, generate_palette, get_pca_frame",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing beyond import and export declarations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; simple re-exports",
  "analysis": "The code imports three functions/classes from a local module called metrics and defines __all__ to specify what is exported. There is no input handling, no data processing, no code execution, or network activity. The structure is straightforward and typical for module exports, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module re-export pattern with no malicious intent or security concerns identified.",
