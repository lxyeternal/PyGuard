{
  "purpose": "The code is importing specific functions or classes from a local metrics module and defining an export list for a package or module.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module .metrics, specifically CoordinationMetrics, generate_palette, and get_pca_frame.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs static imports and defines __all__, with no data flow or input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or unusual code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a relative module and setting the __all__ variable. It does not contain any input handling, data processing, or potentially malicious constructs. There are no suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The structure is typical for Python modules aiming to export certain functions or classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears benign, serving the purpose of module exports without any malicious intent or security risks.",
