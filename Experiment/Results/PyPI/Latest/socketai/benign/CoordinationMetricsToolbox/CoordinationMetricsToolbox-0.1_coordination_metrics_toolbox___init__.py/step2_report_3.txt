  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is simply importing functions/classes from a local module and defining `__all__`. There are no signs of malicious code, dynamic behavior, or data handling.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly interpret the code as benign, standard module setup, with no suspicious patterns or security issues.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's straightforward nature.  \n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a higher risk score. The code is static, does not process untrusted data, and contains no suspicious patterns.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   Since no malicious behavior is observed or implied, malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent across reports, all indicating no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional comments:\n\nGiven the simplicity of the code, there is no indication of hidden malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a standard module initialization or export declaration.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary. The scores reflect the benign nature of this code.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
