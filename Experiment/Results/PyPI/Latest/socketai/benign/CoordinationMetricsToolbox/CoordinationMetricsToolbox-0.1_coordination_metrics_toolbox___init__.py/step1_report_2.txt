  "purpose": "Re-exports specific functions and classes from the metrics module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing from a local metrics module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; no data leaks or unsafe operations detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; import statements are static and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements and an __all__ declaration, which are standard in Python modules to control exported symbols. There are no dynamic code executions, data handling, or external interactions. The module seems to be purely for organizing exports from a local package component, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module export definition with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not process any untrusted data nor contains suspicious or malicious patterns.",
