{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions and classes from a local metrics module and defines an export list for module exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local 'metrics' module: 'CoordinationMetrics', 'generate_palette', 'get_pca_frame'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions based on external input are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; this code only handles imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions and classes from a local module, then defines __all__ for exports. It is straightforward, with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or external data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The code appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py or module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign module import and export declaration with no malicious or security concerns detected.",
