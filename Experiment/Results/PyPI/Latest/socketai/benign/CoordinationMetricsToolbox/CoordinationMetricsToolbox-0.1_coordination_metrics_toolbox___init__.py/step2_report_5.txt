  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward import and export declaration, with no dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code only imports specific functions/classes from a local module and defines `__all__`. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - **Conclusion:** No errors or flaws in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (high confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely import/export with no malicious or risky behavior, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - **Conclusion:** Keep risk scores at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the benign analysis.\n   - No suspicious or malicious activity is indicated.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on observable code patterns.\n   - No unwarranted claims are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's simplicity.\n\n**Final Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Additional Comments:**\n\nGiven the uniformity and clarity of the code, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard module import/export pattern with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is benign.\n- No security risks are present.\n- The current scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\nMaintain the current scoring: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
