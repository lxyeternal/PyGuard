  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present as there is only an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement for a widely used open-source plotting library. There are no input sources, no data processing, no data sinks, or network interactions. The import is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. Since the code is minimal, it lacks any potentially malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\nNo further analysis can be performed due to the limited code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import of a common open-source plotting library with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
