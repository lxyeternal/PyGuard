  "purpose": "This code imports the matplotlib.pyplot library for plotting and visualization tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports a library.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code solely performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement importing a well-known open-source visualization library. There are no data inputs, outputs, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The code is benign, standard, and poses no security risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
