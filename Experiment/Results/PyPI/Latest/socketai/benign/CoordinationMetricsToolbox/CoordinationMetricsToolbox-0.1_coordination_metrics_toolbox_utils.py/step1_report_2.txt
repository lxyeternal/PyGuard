{
  "purpose": "The code imports the matplotlib.pyplot module, likely for creating plots or visualizations.",
  "sources": "Import statement; no external data sources or input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network calls, file writes, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; import alone does not establish any malicious flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of an import statement with no additional logic or context. No suspicious or unusual code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard Python plotting library, which is commonly used for data visualization. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or system manipulation. The minimal code provided does not pose any security risk. Due to the limited scope, there's low confidence in identifying malicious intent, but based on this snippet alone, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign import statement with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected. The code appears to be part of a larger visualization script and does not raise security issues.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
