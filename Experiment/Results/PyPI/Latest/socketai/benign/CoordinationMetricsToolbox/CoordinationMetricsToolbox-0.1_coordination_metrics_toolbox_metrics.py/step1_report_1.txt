{
  "purpose": "This code provides a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing joint angle data, including PCA, correlation, phase analysis, and various coordination metrics, for human movement or robotic joint datasets.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV files containing joint angle and end-effector data; accesses data through attributes and functions such as load_csv_files(), get_data_joints_angles(), and get_concatenate_data().",
  "sinks": "Performs computations on joint and end-effector data; generates plots for analysis; uses data to compute metrics like CRP, PCA, cross-correlation, DTW, and other advanced analyses.",
  "flows": "Data sources are loaded from CSV files; processed for analysis through methods like compute_joints_angular_velocity(), compute_continuous_relative_phase(), and PCA; results are used for plotting or further analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity observed. The code performs standard statistical and signal processing computations. No use of eval(), exec(), or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation or confusing language features present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads, processes, and analyzes joint angle datasets for movement analysis, implementing well-known techniques like PCA, correlation, phase analysis, DTW, and statistical metrics. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. All data processing appears to be standard scientific computation. The functions are structured for movement analysis, visualization, and comparison, with no suspicious or potentially malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, comprehensive analysis toolkit for movement data with no detectable malicious intent or behavior. It solely performs data analysis, visualization, and statistical calculations relevant to movement science or robotics.",
