{
  "purpose": "The code provides a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing joint angle data, computing coordination metrics, and visualizing results in human movement or robotic joint studies.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV files containing joint and end-effector data; accesses data columns for angles, velocities, and position coordinates.",
  "sinks": "Performs data processing and plotting; no evident data leaks or untrusted data sinks are present; no network, file, or system harm actions are executed.",
  "flows": "Loads data from CSVs -> processes data (e.g., PCA, cross-correlation, CRP, DTW) -> optional plotting and analysis outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. No obfuscated or misleading code segments are present. Functions primarily perform standard statistical and plotting operations.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific analysis toolkit. It loads CSV data, processes joint angles, computes various metrics, and visualizes results. No network communication, system commands, or malicious data handling behaviors are evident. The code uses well-known libraries and standard methods for data analysis and visualization. There are no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden malicious payloads. The functions follow logical data flow without suspicious manipulations. Overall, the code is consistent with normal movement data analysis routines, with no malicious intent or hidden sabotage detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical movement data analysis library with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It performs standard statistical, PCA, correlation, and plotting tasks for joint angle datasets, with no indication of security risks or malware. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
