{
  "purpose": "The code provides a comprehensive analysis toolkit for movement data, including loading CSV files, computing PCA, correlation, phase analysis, DTW, and visualization, primarily for biomechanics or robotics applications.",
  "sources": "CSV files containing joint and end-effector data, read via pandas.read_csv, with no external network or system calls.",
  "sinks": "Data processing and visualization within pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, with no external communication or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from CSV input to DataFrames, through various analysis functions (e.g., PCA, correlation, phase computation), and results are visualized or returned as DataFrames.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured, transparent implementation of movement analysis methods. It reads data, processes it with standard algorithms, and visualizes results. No code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The use of external libraries like fastdtw is typical for DTW calculations and does not introduce security concerns. The code does not perform any system modifications or data exfiltration. The logic is consistent, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a legitimate, open-source movement analysis toolkit with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It is designed for scientific data processing and visualization, and all signals indicate it is safe.",
