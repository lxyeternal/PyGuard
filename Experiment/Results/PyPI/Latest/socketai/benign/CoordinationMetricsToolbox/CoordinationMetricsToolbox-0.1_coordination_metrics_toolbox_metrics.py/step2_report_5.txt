  "review": "Let's analyze the supply chain security reports step-by-step:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a comprehensive, standard data analysis toolkit for joint movement data, including PCA, correlation, phase analysis, DTW, and visualization.\n- No suspicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The code relies solely on well-known open-source libraries and performs typical scientific computations.\n- No network activity, file system manipulation beyond reading CSVs, or dynamic code execution is reported or observed.\n- The reports consistently conclude the code is legitimate, with no malware or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code appears clean, with no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- Data processing and plotting are standard and do not involve untrusted code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or system modifications are present.\n\n### Flaws or Logical Mistakes:\n- The code and reports are consistent; no logical flaws or suspicious reasoning are evident.\n- The analysis correctly identifies the purpose and data flow, with appropriate security assessments.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — No malicious activity or payloads detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — No obfuscation or confusing code patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — Given the above, the overall security risk is negligible.\n\n### Potential Assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is only used as intended (scientific analysis). No evidence suggests malicious intent.\n- No hidden malicious behavior is implied or detected.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The reports' assessments align with the observed code behavior.\n- The scores are reasonable and conservative, reflecting the absence of threats.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n**Malware Score:** **0.0**  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0.0**  \n**Risk Score:** **0.0**\n\nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured analysis toolkit with no security concerns. The comprehensive review supports this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **The code is safe, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors detected.**  \n- **All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.**  \n- **No changes to the reported scores are necessary.**",
