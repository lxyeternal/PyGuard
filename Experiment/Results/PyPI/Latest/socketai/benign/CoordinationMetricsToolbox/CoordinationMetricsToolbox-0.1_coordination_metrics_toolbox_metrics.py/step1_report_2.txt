{
  "purpose": "This code implements a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing joint angle data in movement datasets, including PCA, correlation, CRP, and other metrics.",
  "sources": "The code reads CSV files containing joint angle data via pandas.read_csv, with data stored in self.data_joints_angles; it also reads specific columns for velocity and end-effector data.",
  "sinks": "The code performs computations on dataframes and plots results; no sinks execute untrusted commands or perform network communication.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from CSV files into pandas dataframes (sources), then processed through various mathematical and statistical functions (flows), with optional plotting (sink for visualization).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behavior are detected. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variables are present. The code relies on standard libraries and typical data processing techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code is a detailed, well-structured analysis toolkit for joint movement data, with extensive methods for loading, processing, analyzing, and plotting data. All operations are standard for data analysis in Python, using open-source libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib. No network, system modification, or suspicious data exfiltration actions are present. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. The code appears to be purely for movement analysis and visualization. The use of common packages and the absence of dynamic code execution or suspicious commands suggest low risk of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, comprehensive data analysis suite for joint movement datasets, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs typical data processing, analysis, and visualization tasks without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
