  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the CoordinationMetricsToolbox Python package, defining dependencies, entry points, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads dependencies from 'install_requires', reads long description from 'README.md', and uses package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script primarily sets up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Input sources include dependency list and README file; no data flows to untrusted sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and conventional for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The empty reports indicate no issues or vulnerabilities have been identified. The only minor concern is the dynamic reading of 'README.md', which is standard practice. Given the lack of evidence, the package appears benign, with no malware or obfuscation present. The scores should reflect minimal risk and no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The package is a standard, benign Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The empty reports do not suggest any issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is very low (~0.1).",
