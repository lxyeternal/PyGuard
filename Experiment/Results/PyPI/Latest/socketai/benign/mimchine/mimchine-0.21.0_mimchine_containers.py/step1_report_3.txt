{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to interact with container and image management via the Podman CLI, including checking container existence, status, labels, and image existence.",
  "sources": "Reads data from Podman CLI commands executed via the 'sh' library, specifically 'podman ps', 'podman images', and 'podman image exists'.",
  "sinks": "Uses json.loads on command outputs, and raises exceptions if commands fail; no direct use of untrusted input in security-sensitive operations beyond command execution.",
  "flows": "Executes shell commands via 'sh', parses JSON output, then processes container/image data within Python functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. Usage of 'sh' to invoke system commands is standard, but potential for command injection is mitigated as commands are fixed strings with no user input involved.",
  "analysis": "The code performs container and image management operations via Podman CLI commands wrapped in Python functions. It securely executes commands using the 'sh' library, which properly isolates command execution. No dynamic command execution or unsanitized input is evident. The functions handle command failures gracefully (e.g., 'image_exists' catches 'ErrorReturnCode'). There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward management utility with no malicious intent or security risks present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard container management utility with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It safely interacts with Podman CLI, handles errors appropriately, and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious code segments.",
