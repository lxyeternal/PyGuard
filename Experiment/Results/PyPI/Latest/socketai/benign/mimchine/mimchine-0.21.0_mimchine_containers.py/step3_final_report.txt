  "purpose": "Container management functions using Podman CLI via 'sh' library, including listing containers/images and checking their existence/status/labels.",
  "sources": "Static command strings executed via 'sh' commands; JSON outputs parsed locally.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed, no data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Static commands -> JSON parsing -> function returns; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic execution; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code uses static, predefined Podman commands executed through 'sh', with JSON outputs parsed securely. Error handling is appropriate, and no secrets or obfuscation are present. The functions perform container/image checks without involving user input or network activity. The design minimizes security risks, and no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard container management utility with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
