{
  "purpose": "The code interacts with Podman to manage and query container and image states, likely for container orchestration or monitoring.",
  "sources": "Reads container data via 'podman ps' and 'podman images', and checks for container existence and state, as well as image existence.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data directly leading to potential vulnerabilities; output is printed, and data is processed internally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from podman command outputs (JSON) to Python objects, then to functions that check container/image status, with no untrusted data affecting critical security functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. Use of 'sh' library for command execution is standard, and JSON parsing is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script safely calls podman commands and parses JSON outputs to determine container and image states. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code does not process untrusted input in a way that leads to code injection or data leaks. It uses subprocess calls and exception handling appropriately. Overall, it appears to be a standard, safe management script for container status checks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical container management utility with no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It handles data securely and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
