{
  "purpose": "The code interacts with the Podman container management tool to list containers, check container existence and status, and manage images, primarily for container management and monitoring.",
  "sources": "Reads container lists and image lists via Podman commands, particularly in get_containers() and get_images().",
  "sinks": "Executes Podman commands through sh.Command(). The commands' outputs are parsed as JSON. The only potential sink involves running commands with untrusted parameters, but all parameters are hardcoded.",
  "flows": "get_containers() and get_images() run Podman commands and parse JSON outputs; container_exists(), container_is_running(), container_is_mim() analyze container data; image_exists() runs a command to verify image existence.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. The code relies on standard subprocess interactions with a container runtime. No suspicious data leaks or privacy violations observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses the 'sh' library to invoke Podman commands and processes their JSON output to check container and image states. All command parameters are static, and outputs are processed locally. No input from untrusted sources or network communication is involved. The code appears to be straightforward container management logic without any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard container management operations via Podman with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It does not contain obfuscated code or malicious payloads. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
