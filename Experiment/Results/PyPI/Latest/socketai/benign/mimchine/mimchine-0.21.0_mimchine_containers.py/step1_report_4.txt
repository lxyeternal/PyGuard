{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to interact with container and image management using Podman via shell commands, including retrieving container information, checking container existence and status, and image existence.",
  "sources": "Reads data from Podman commands: 'podman ps --format json', 'podman images --format json', and 'podman image exists <name>'.",
  "sinks": "Uses json.loads to parse command output; calls shell commands via sh.Command().",
  "flows": "Command output is captured and passed to json.loads; image existence check relies on executing a command that may raise an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; use of shell commands is standard. The 'image_exists' function uses exception handling as control flow, which could potentially be misused if not carefully controlled, but here it is a typical pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly interfaces with Podman using shell commands through the 'sh' library, parsing JSON output for container and image management tasks. The functions seem straightforward and do not perform any unsafe operations, such as executing untrusted input or writing data externally. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are evident. The use of 'try-except' in 'image_exists' is standard for handling command failure. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate utility functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of container management utilities that interact with Podman using shell commands. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware. The only notable aspect is the reliance on shell command execution, which is typical for such tasks and poses no immediate security risk in this context.",
