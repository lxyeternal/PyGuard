  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code is straightforward; no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The only anomaly is the unused import of `os`. This is not a security concern but could be cleaned up.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - Risk: 0.1 — reasonable, given the code is benign but has an unused import.\n- **Justification for risk score:** The low risk score seems appropriate; no security issues.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment and scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a standard pattern for version retrieval.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No suspicious behavior or anomalies.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No security concerns or malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report and scores are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to previous, straightforward version retrieval.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No anomalies.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - Risk: 0.1 — acceptable for benign code.\n- **Justification:** No security issues.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Again, standard version retrieval.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Risk: 0 — justified.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report and scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Similar pattern, no anomalies.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Risk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign, standard version retrieval pattern.\n- The only minor anomaly across reports is the unused `os` import, which is not a security concern.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent in any of the snippets.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — consistent across all reports and justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — slight, due to the unused import, but overall very low.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate, and the reports are accurate in their assessments.",
