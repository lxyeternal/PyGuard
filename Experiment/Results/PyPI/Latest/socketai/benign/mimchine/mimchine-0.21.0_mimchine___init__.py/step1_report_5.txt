{
  "purpose": "Determine the version of the package using a custom function, likely for package metadata management.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ attribute for the current file's path, importing modules, and calling get_version with module name and path.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from obtaining the file path (__file__), to determining the parent directory, and then passing these to get_version to retrieve version info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The get_version function's implementation is unknown, but its usage appears standard for version retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for path operations and version retrieval. It defines a path based on the current file's location, then calls get_version with the module's name and path. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious code, or obfuscated logic. The overall structure is typical for Python package version management.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to perform a standard version retrieval task with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply fetches the package version using a helper function.",
