  "purpose": "Load the version of the current package or module using an external utility.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__ to determine the current file's path; calling get_version with module name and path.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The code reads the current file path, then calls get_version with module name and directory path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard libraries and an external version utility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Path from pathlib and os, then defines a path relative to the current file's location. It uses an external function get_version to determine the version string based on the module name and the parent directory. The code is simple, with no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious dynamic execution, and no external network activity. The use of get_version might depend on its implementation, but based solely on this snippet, it appears to be a standard version retrieval method.\n\nNo signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are present in this fragment. The code is standard for version management in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard version retrieval operation without any malicious intent or security concerns. It appears safe and typical for package version management.",
