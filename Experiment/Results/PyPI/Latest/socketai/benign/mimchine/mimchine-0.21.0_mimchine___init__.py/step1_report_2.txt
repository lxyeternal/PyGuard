{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves the version of a module or package using an external function.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the __file__ variable and calls get_version with __name__ and a path derived from __file__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The source __file__ flows into get_version via __name__ and _ver_path; no further data flows or sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious intent are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a path based on the file location, then calls get_version to determine the version information. It imports standard libraries pathlib and os, and a local function get_version. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious activity. It does not interact with network, environment variables, or user input. The use of get_version is typical for retrieving version info. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for version retrieval in a Python package, with no malicious or security risks identified.",
