{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that determines its version information using an external function.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'Path' from 'pathlib', 'os', and 'get_version' from 'single_source'. The call to 'get_version' with '__name__' and a constructed path.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "The code flows from imports to setting a version variable via 'get_version', based on the module's path.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. Usage of external 'single_source' library could be benign or malicious, but alone it is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a path based on the current file's location, then retrieves version information using 'get_version'. There are no user inputs, no network activity, no data leaks, and no suspicious logic. It mainly serves to manage versioning in a standard way. The only external dependency, 'single_source', is used as intended for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears to be for version management without any malicious intent or security issues. There is no indication of malware or malicious behavior. The code is low risk.",
