{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the package version using an external utility, likely for version management or display.",
  "sources": "The get_version function imported from single_source, called with __name__ and a path derived from __file__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or external communications present.",
  "flows": "Input source: __name__ and __file__ (via get_version); output: __VERSION__ assigned the version string.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'os' module; no other anomalies or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward version retrieval using an external utility. The 'os' import is unused, which is a minor code smell but not security-relevant. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. The external 'single_source' library's behavior is assumed benign based on context. The code is simple, clear, and standard for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The only minor concern is the unused 'os' import, which does not impact security. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
