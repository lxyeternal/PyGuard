      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent container management CLI with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (~0.2) is justified, primarily due to filesystem permission practices that are typical in container environments. Overall, the code appears safe and non-malicious."

All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, assign a malware score of 0, and low security risk. The unused 'os' import is a minor code smell but not a security concern. Overall, the code is safe, and the assessments are accurate."
