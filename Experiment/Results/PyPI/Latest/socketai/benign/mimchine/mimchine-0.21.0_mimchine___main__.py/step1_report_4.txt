{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point for a Python application, invoking the 'app' function from a local module named 'cli'.",
  "sources": "The code reads nothing directly; it imports and calls 'app' from the local 'cli' module.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'app()', which could potentially be a command-line interface or application entry point; any malicious behavior depends on 'app' implementation.",
  "flows": "No direct data flows; the flow depends on 'app()' execution, which is not provided.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed; the code is a standard Python script bootstrap.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a local 'cli' module and calls its 'app' function within the main guard. It functions as a simple launcher. Without inspecting 'cli.py', no malicious activity can be inferred from this code alone. The structure is minimal and typical for CLI applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard application bootstrap script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. Its safety depends entirely on the implementation of 'app()' in the 'cli' module, which is not provided.",
