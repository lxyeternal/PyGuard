{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal CLI entry point that imports an 'app' from a local module and executes it when run directly.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .cli and the call to app() within main()",
  "sinks": "The execution of app() could be a sink if app() executes untrusted code or performs malicious actions, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the main() function calling app(), which is invoked when __name__ == '__main__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI bootstrap script that imports an 'app' object/function and executes it. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'app()' in the 'cli' module, which is outside this snippet. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate, but given the benign appearance, the risk score can be lowered to 0. The malware score remains at 0, and obfuscation is not present. The overall security posture is minimal risk, contingent on 'app()' implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python CLI entry point with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The current scores are appropriate, but the risk score can be safely adjusted to 0 for a more accurate reflection of the benign nature of this snippet.",
