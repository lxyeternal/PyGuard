  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point that imports and runs a CLI application.",
  "sources": "Importing from .cli import app, and the __main__ block calling app()",
  "sinks": "Calling app() in the main block, potentially executing code from the cli module",
  "flows": "Execution flows from the __main__ block to app() imported from the cli module",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed within this snippet",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports an application object 'app' from a local module 'cli' and executes it if run as the main program. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The code itself is minimal and appears to be a typical Python CLI entry point. Any potential malicious behavior would depend on the implementation of the 'app' function in the 'cli' module, which is not shown here. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or network operations within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple entry point for a CLI application. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security issues within itself. The security posture depends on the 'cli' module's 'app' implementation, which is not provided. Overall, this code appears safe.",
