{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point for executing a CLI application by importing an 'app' object and invoking it in the main function.",
  "sources": "The code reads nothing directly from external sources; it imports 'app' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'app()' which could be a command-line interface or application entry point; no external data sink is explicitly present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are apparent within this snippet beyond the invocation of 'app()'. The 'app()' function might have internal flows, but that is outside this code's scope.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies. It imports 'app' locally and executes it, which is typical for CLI apps.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a main function that calls an imported 'app' object, likely a CLI or application. There are no hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious patterns present. Since the functionality of 'app()' is not shown, no malicious behavior can be inferred from this snippet alone. The structure is standard for Python CLI entry points.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and standard for a CLI application entry point. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues within this snippet.",
