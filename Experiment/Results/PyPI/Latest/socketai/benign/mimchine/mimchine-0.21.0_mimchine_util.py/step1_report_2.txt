{
  "purpose": "Define global options management with functions to set and get options",
  "sources": "os module (imported but not used further in the code), GLOBAL_OPTIONS dictionary, set_option and get_option functions",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external outputs present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks that could lead to vulnerabilities",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward global state management without suspicious or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'os' module but does not utilize it, indicating potential leftover or preparatory code. The GLOBAL_OPTIONS dictionary contains a single static option. Functions to modify and access this dictionary are simple and do not handle untrusted input or perform system operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side effects. The code appears benign and intended for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple configuration state handler with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The unused import does not affect security, and the functions operate on a static in-memory dictionary without external interactions.",
