  "sinks": "No apparent sink; no data leaks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Input via set_option() updates GLOBAL_OPTIONS; get_option() retrieves data from it.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No use of untrusted input sources. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple global options dictionary, with functions to set and retrieve options. The operations are straightforward and do not involve external data sources, network activity, or sensitive data handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The code appears to be a basic configuration management utility without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple configuration manager with no evident malicious behavior or security risks.",
