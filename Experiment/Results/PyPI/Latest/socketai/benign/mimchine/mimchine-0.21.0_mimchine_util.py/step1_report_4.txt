  "purpose": "Define and manage global configuration options within a Python module.",
  "sources": "Reading from the GLOBAL_OPTIONS dictionary in set_option and get_option functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially could modify GLOBAL_OPTIONS, which might influence program behavior based on external input, but no external input sources are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "set_option receives an option name and value, updating GLOBAL_OPTIONS; get_option retrieves the value for a specified option.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and only manipulates a global dictionary.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a global options dictionary and provides functions to set and get options dynamically. There are no input validation, no external data sources, and no operations that interact with the system or network. The code appears to serve as a simple configuration manager. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration handling pattern with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain obfuscation, malware, or security risks.",
