{
  "purpose": "This code manages a global configuration options dictionary with functions to set and get options.",
  "sources": "The code reads input only from predefined function calls that access the GLOBAL_OPTIONS dictionary.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to the GLOBAL_OPTIONS dictionary via the set_option function.",
  "flows": "The flow involves calling set_option to modify GLOBAL_OPTIONS, which can influence get_option outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code does not execute or evaluate untrusted input or code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple global options dictionary and provides functions to set and retrieve options. It does not process external input directly, nor does it perform any network communication, data leakage, or execution of untrusted code. There are no obfuscation techniques, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors observed. The structure is straightforward, with no anomalies or indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a basic configuration management utility with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks.",
