  "purpose": "Provides functions to set and get global configuration options stored in a dictionary.",
  "sources": "Reads from the 'GLOBAL_OPTIONS' dictionary when retrieving options.",
  "sinks": "Writes to the 'GLOBAL_OPTIONS' dictionary when setting options.",
  "flows": "set_option modifies 'GLOBAL_OPTIONS' based on input; get_option retrieves data from it.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no unusual data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a global options dictionary with a default 'test' flag set to False. It provides simple setter and getter functions to modify and access this dictionary. There are no inputs from external untrusted sources, no external network or file I/O, and no suspicious logic. The functions operate on a controlled in-memory dictionary without any complex or malicious operations. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, intended for configuration management, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a benign utility module.",
