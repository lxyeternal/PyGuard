  "purpose": "Manage a global options dictionary with functions to set and get options.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'option' and 'value' in set_option; 'option' in get_option.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into dictionary modifications or retrievals; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'os'; no other anomalies or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a global dictionary 'GLOBAL_OPTIONS' with a default key 'test'. It provides functions to modify and access this dictionary. There are no external inputs, network activity, or code execution. The 'os' module is imported but not used, which is benign but indicates leftover code. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code operates solely on in-memory data structures, with straightforward logic and no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign configuration utility with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, assign a malware score of 0, and low security risk. The unused 'os' import is a minor code smell but not a security concern. Overall, the code is safe, and the assessments are accurate.",
