{
  "purpose": "The code provides geometric calculations (perimeters) for various shapes, converting input dimensions to a specified target unit.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from dictionary or list parameters, specifically from their keys and values, which contain measurement units and dimensions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data affects system state or leaks are present; functions return formatted strings with calculated perimeters.",
  "flows": "Input dimensions are extracted from data structures, converted via 'convert_to_base_unit', then used to compute perimeters; data flow is confined within function scope with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "The 'sphere' function returns an empty string without any calculation or data usage; some functions like 'sphere' and 'polygon' contain inconsistent or placeholder return values, which are not inherently malicious but suggest incomplete implementation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward geometric perimeter calculations with input parsing and unit conversions. The use of 'convert_to_base_unit' suggests reliance on an external module, which appears to be a standard conversion utility. No network operations, system modifications, or obfuscated code patterns are present. The empty return in 'sphere' is unusual but not malicious. Overall, no malicious or sabotage behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a set of geometric calculation utilities with no evidence of malicious intent. The main concern is the incomplete 'sphere' function returning an empty string, which indicates possible incomplete development but not malicious behavior. The overall security risk is very low.",
