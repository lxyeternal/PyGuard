  "purpose": "Provide geometric calculations (perimeters) for various shapes with unit conversion support.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from dictionaries and lists representing shape dimensions and units.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data causing security effects or leaks; no network operations or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "Input data (dictionaries/lists) → conversion functions → perimeter calculations → returned strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of a 'convert_to_base_unit' function suggests reliance on external module, but no malicious behavior is evident. The 'sphere' function returns an empty string, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs shape perimeter calculations with unit conversions. Data is sourced from dictionaries/lists, processed through a consistent pattern, and results are formatted as strings. No dynamic code execution, network access, or file manipulation is present. The 'sphere' function does not return a perimeter, only an empty string, which is inconsistent but not malicious. The use of a local import '.unit_converter' indicates dependence on external, presumably safe, conversion logic. Overall, the code contains no suspicious or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate geometric calculations without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. There are no indicators of malware or security risks within this code fragment.",
