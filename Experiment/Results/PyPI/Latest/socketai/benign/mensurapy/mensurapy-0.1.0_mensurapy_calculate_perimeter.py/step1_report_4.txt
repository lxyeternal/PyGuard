{
  "purpose": "Provide geometric calculations for various shapes including perimeter, area, and other properties, with unit conversions.",
  "sources": "Input data via dictionaries or lists containing shape dimensions and units.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data leaks or external communications observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input structures (dictionaries/lists) through convert_to_base_unit calls to perimeter or property calculations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic string formatting for outputs; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling; no malicious code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs shape-specific calculations, converting units via an imported function and computing perimeters or other metrics. All functions process input data in a straightforward manner, with no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or unintended behaviors. The 'sphere' function returns an empty string and does not perform calculations, which might be an oversight but is not malicious. No network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Overall, the code appears to be a standard geometric calculation module with proper handling of input data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, geometric computation module that processes shape dimensions, performs unit conversions, and calculates perimeters. No malicious behavior or supply chain security risks are detected.",
