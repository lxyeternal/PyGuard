  "purpose": "Convert a numerical value from a specified unit to a base unit (meters by default).",
  "sources": "The input parameters 'value', 'from_unit', and 'base_unit'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is output to external systems or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' and 'from_unit' are used to compute 'value_in_meters', then converted to the desired 'base_unit' and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual logic. The code performs straightforward unit conversion.",
  "analysis": "The function defines a dictionary of conversion factors for length units. It checks if the provided units are supported and then converts the input value from the source unit to meters, followed by conversion to the target base unit. The process is direct and does not include any external system interaction, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, legitimate unit conversion without any malicious behavior or security issues. It is safe and does not appear to be part of a supply chain attack or malicious payload.",
