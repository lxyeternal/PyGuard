{
  "purpose": "Convert a given value from a specified unit to a base unit (meters by default).",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'value', 'from_unit', and optional 'base_unit'. The 'from_unit' and 'base_unit' are used to determine conversion factors.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a numeric conversion result. No direct sinks that cause data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to look up conversion factors, then compute the converted value through multiplication and division operations. No external data flows or side effects observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The code performs straightforward unit conversions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple conversion function with a dictionary of units and conversion factors. It performs input validation to ensure units are supported. The conversion process involves multiplying by the 'from_unit' factor to get meters, then dividing by the 'base_unit' factor to convert to the target unit. There are no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or security risks. The code appears clean, functional, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function for unit conversion with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply performs arithmetic operations based on predefined conversion factors.",
