{
  "purpose": "Convert a numerical value from one unit of length to another, defaulting to meters as the base unit.",
  "sources": "The function reads the input parameters 'value', 'from_unit', and optionally 'base_unit'. It also accesses the 'conversion_factors' dictionary.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sink points that process untrusted data beyond standard validation; no data leaks or system effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated against the dictionary; the value is converted to meters, then to the target unit, following a straightforward calculation flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns. The function performs simple arithmetic conversions with proper validation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a conversion function with a dictionary for unit-to-meter conversion factors. It validates input units against the dictionary, raises an error if invalid, then performs two multiplication/division steps for conversion. The logic is clear, straightforward, and lacks any hidden or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit conversion utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs safe, expected operations without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
