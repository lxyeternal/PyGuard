{
  "purpose": "Convert a numerical value from a specified unit to a base unit (meters by default).",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'value', 'from_unit', and optional 'base_unit'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is used in a way that leads to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used directly in calculations without external dependencies; the flow is straightforward conversion logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or dynamic execution are present. The code performs simple, transparent calculations.",
  "analysis": "The function defines conversion factors for various units, performs validation on units, and calculates the conversion by converting to meters and then to the target unit. The code is clean, direct, and uses standard Python constructs. No obfuscated code, no external network calls, no manipulation of sensitive data, and no hidden behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, well-structured unit conversion function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
