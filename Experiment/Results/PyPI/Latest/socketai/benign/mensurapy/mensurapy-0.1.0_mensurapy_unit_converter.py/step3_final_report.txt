  "purpose": "A simple utility function to convert length units to a base unit (meters) and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'value', 'from_unit', 'base_unit'; the 'conversion_factors' dictionary.",
  "sinks": "The return statement outputs the converted value; no external data sinks or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' is multiplied by 'conversion_factors[from_unit]' to get meters, then divided by 'conversion_factors[base_unit]' to convert to target unit.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard validation and arithmetic operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a basic unit conversion using a static dictionary of conversion factors. It validates units, converts the input value to meters, then to the target unit. No external dependencies, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present. The logic is correct, and no suspicious behavior or malicious code is evident. Validation is appropriate, and the code is transparent and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility function for unit conversion with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
