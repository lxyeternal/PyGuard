{
  "purpose": "Convert a numerical value from one length unit to another, with default conversion to meters.",
  "sources": "The function takes 'value', 'from_unit', and optionally 'base_unit' as input parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is directly sent to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' and 'from_unit' are used to compute 'value_in_meters'; the result is returned after conversion.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior; straightforward unit conversion logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple unit conversion function using a static dictionary of conversion factors. It validates input units, performs conversion from 'from_unit' to meters, then from meters to 'base_unit'. No external data access, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are present. The logic is clear, standard, and safe for the intended purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard unit conversion with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a straightforward implementation with no anomalies or malware indicators.",
