{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to calculate the volumes of various 3D geometric shapes, converting input dimensions to a specified target unit.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters (dictionaries and lists) representing shape dimensions.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks where untrusted data is written or transmitted externally, such as network connections or file operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters (shape dimensions) through conversion functions to volume calculations, then results are returned as formatted strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of 'convert_to_base_unit' imported from a local module is benign, assuming it's a legitimate conversion function.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard geometric volume calculations with dimension conversions. The functions process input dictionaries and lists, extract dimensions, convert units, and compute volumes accordingly. Exception handling is implemented for input errors. No network, file, or secret-related operations are present. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code appears to serve a mathematical purpose with straightforward logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of geometric volume calculators with unit conversion. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behaviors. It is safe and aligned with its apparent purpose. No security risks are identified.",
