{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some data processing or utility functions based on its structure and imported modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from user input, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially reach sensitive functions like system commands, network transmissions, or file writes, depending on the code's structure.",
  "flows": "Data from sources such as user input or environment variables flows into processing functions, and potentially reaches sinks like system calls, network operations, or file manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors are observed. Unusual dynamic execution or misleading variables are absent based on the provided code.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs. It imports standard libraries, performs expected operations, and does not contain code that directly accesses or transmits sensitive data without clear context. No hidden or malicious behaviors are detected. The structure suggests it is a utility or helper module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with no suspicious signals. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
