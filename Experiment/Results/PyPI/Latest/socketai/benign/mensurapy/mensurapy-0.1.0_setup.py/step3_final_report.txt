  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'mensurapy' Python package, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including package metadata, author info, URL, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only defines package metadata without runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. All provided reports are empty, containing no findings or evidence of issues. Given the lack of any suspicious activity, the code appears benign. The URL points to a GitHub repository, but without further context, no malicious intent can be inferred. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should be zero, aligning with the absence of any detected issues or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The package's setup script is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The empty reports do not provide any contrary findings. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is 0, indicating a safe and standard package.",
