  "purpose": "A utility function to parse input arguments, identify the shape, and compute its surface area by calling shape-specific functions.",
  "sources": "Input arguments passed to the surface_area function, and the param_parser function for parsing data.",
  "sinks": "Calls to shape-specific functions (cube, cuboid, sphere, etc.) with parsed dimensions; no external sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Arguments → param_parser → shape identification → shape function call with dimensions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input presence, parses arguments into dimensions and shape, then dispatches to shape-specific surface area functions. It relies on external modules for parsing and calculations, but these are not inherently malicious. No network, file, or environment modifications are present. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The minimal validation and reliance on external modules are noted but do not indicate security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for calculating surface areas of various shapes. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
