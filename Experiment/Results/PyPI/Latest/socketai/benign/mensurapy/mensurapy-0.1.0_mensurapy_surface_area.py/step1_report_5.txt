{
  "purpose": "The code appears to parse input arguments to determine the shape and dimensions, then calculates the surface area for various 3D shapes.",
  "sources": "Input arguments to the surface_area function, passed via *args; data returned from param_parser(args).",
  "sinks": "The return value of the surface_area function, which outputs calculation results or error messages.",
  "flows": "Input args -> param_parser -> shape determination -> shape-specific function call -> result returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No unusual data handling or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two modules presumably containing functions for parsing parameters and calculating surface areas. It validates presence of arguments, parses them, then calls shape-specific functions based on the parsed shape name. The flow is straightforward and uses standard control structures without dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic. No external network calls, file operations, or environment variable manipulations are present. The logic appears typical for a geometry calculation utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for calculating surface areas of shapes based on user input. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks identified. It functions as expected for its purpose.",
