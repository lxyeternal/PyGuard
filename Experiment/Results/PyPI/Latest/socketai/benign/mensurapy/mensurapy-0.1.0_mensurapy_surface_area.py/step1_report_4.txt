{
  "purpose": "This code defines a function to compute the surface area of various geometric shapes based on input arguments, utilizing external modules for parsing input and performing calculations.",
  "sources": "The function reads input arguments via *args and calls param_parser(args) to interpret user data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data in a way that could lead to data leaks or harmful effects. No network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input arguments → param_parser for parsing → shape determination → corresponding shape function call",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed. The code primarily relies on external modules.",
  "analysis": "The code starts with importing modules for parsing input data and calculating surface areas. The surface_area function checks for presence of arguments and returns an error if none are provided. It then parses arguments to determine dimensions and shape, and calls the corresponding function for each shape. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The logic appears straightforward and limited to computation based on provided inputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple utility for calculating surface areas of shapes with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It relies on external modules for parsing and calculation but does not perform any suspicious actions itself.",
