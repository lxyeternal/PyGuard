{
  "purpose": "The code provides a function to calculate the surface area of various geometric shapes based on input arguments, by parsing input parameters and delegating calculations to specific shape functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input arguments via the function parameters (*args), and calls param_parser(args) to process the input data.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data for external effects such as network transmission, file operations, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are parsed by param_parser, and the shape type determines which shape function (e.g., cube, cuboid) is called with the parsed dimensions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard function calls. The import statements rely on local modules, which cannot be evaluated here, but their names suggest standard functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules intended for parameter parsing and surface area calculations. It defines a surface_area function that first checks for input presence. It calls param_parser to process the input args, which should return dimensions and shape. Based on the shape string, it calls the corresponding shape function with parsed dimensions. There are no evident security issues, no dynamic code execution, and no external network interactions. The code is simple and appears to be a standard geometric calculation utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for surface area calculations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The structure is straightforward, and no suspicious activities are evident.",
