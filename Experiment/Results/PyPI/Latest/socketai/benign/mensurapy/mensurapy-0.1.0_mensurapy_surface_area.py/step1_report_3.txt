{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to calculate surface areas for various 3D shapes based on user input.",
  "sources": "The function receives input arguments via *args, which are processed by param_parser() to extract dimensions and shape type.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive actions like file access, network communication, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are parsed by param_parser(), then based on shape type, specific shape functions are called with parsed dimensions. The flow is args -> param_parser() -> shape function -> return result.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies on imported modules for parameter parsing and shape calculations; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated or malicious-looking code structures. No use of insecure functions or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code accepts variable arguments and processes them through param_parser() to determine shape and dimensions. It then calls specific functions for each shape. The structure appears standard for a calculation utility. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The modules imported are likely for valid purposes: data parsing and geometric calculations. No network activity, system modifications, or obfuscated techniques are present. The code's only potential concern is its reliance on external modules, which could be malicious, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for surface area calculations with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
