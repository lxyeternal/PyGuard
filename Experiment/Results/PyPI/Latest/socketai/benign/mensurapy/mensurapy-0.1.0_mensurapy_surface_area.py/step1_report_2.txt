  "purpose": "The code provides a function to calculate surface area for various 3D shapes based on user input.",
  "sources": "Input arguments to the surface_area function, and the param_parser function call which processes *args.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain direct sinks that handle untrusted data in a way that leads to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input args -> param_parser -> shape determination -> shape function call (e.g., cube, sphere) -> result return.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies on imported modules without inspecting their contents; no apparent malicious activity. Usage of * for importing all from modules may obscure dependencies but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs input validation for empty arguments, then parses arguments via param_parser to identify the shape and its dimensions. It calls shape-specific functions (cube, cuboid, sphere, etc.) based on the shape identified. No suspicious or malicious code, network activity, or credential handling is present. The logic appears straightforward, focusing solely on geometric calculations. The imported modules are not examined but appear to relate to mathematical calculations and parsing. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for calculating surface areas of shapes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs input validation and shape-based function dispatching without involving external or untrusted data sources beyond function parameters.",
