  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for calculating surface areas of various shapes. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose."
