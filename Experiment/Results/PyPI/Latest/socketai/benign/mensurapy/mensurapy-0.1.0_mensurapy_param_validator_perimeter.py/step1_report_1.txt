{
  "purpose": "The code provides parameter validation functions for various geometric shapes, checking the number of arguments passed to each shape-specific function.",
  "sources": "Function inputs (`args`) which are expected to be lists or similar iterable structures containing shape parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects; functions simply return boolean values based on input length.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow into validation functions and produce boolean outputs; no untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No signs of unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and consistent in style.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of simple length checks on input parameter lists for different shapes. There are no external data reads, no system commands, no network operations, and no unsafe code execution. The functions serve as validators based on the number of parameters, which appears standard for shape calculations. The code lacks any suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. No signs of obfuscation, data exfiltration, or malicious side effects are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign set of parameter validation functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs simple input validation based on argument counts without any dangerous operations.",
