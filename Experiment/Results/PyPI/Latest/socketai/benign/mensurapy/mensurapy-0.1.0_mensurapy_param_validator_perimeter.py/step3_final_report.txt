{
  "purpose": "The code provides parameter validation functions for various geometric shapes, checking the length of input argument lists.",
  "sources": "Input argument lists passed to each validator function (args).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data beyond length validation, nor does it perform data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input args are checked for length; no further data flow or external interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs straightforward length checks with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of simple functions that validate the number of parameters for different shapes. There are no external data reads, network calls, or malicious payloads. The functions serve as input validators, returning True if the argument list length matches expected values. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code is clear, straightforward, and safe. The assigned scores of malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, and confidence=1 are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as basic parameter validation functions with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
