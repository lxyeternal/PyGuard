{
  "purpose": "The code provides parameter validation functions for various geometric shapes, checking if the input argument list length matches expected values.",
  "sources": "Input arguments 'args' passed to each validator function",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data directly affects system state or leaks occur",
  "flows": "Input data flows through the functions, primarily to determine validity based on length",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs detected; functions are simple validators",
  "analysis": "Each validator function checks the length of the input argument list to determine validity for specific shapes. No external input processing, no I/O operations, no network activity, and no data transformations that could be malicious. The functions are straightforward, with no evident malicious intent or security flaws. The code is simple validation logic without obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward validation functions for shape parameters, with no malicious or security concerns detected.",
