  "purpose": "Validation functions for different geometric shape parameters based on argument list length",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'args' for each shape validator functions",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, external outputs, or side-effects observed",
  "flows": "Input 'args' flows through length checks to return boolean validation results",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded values are simply shape-specific parameter counts, no obfuscation or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of multiple straightforward functions checking the length of input argument lists for various shape parameter validations. No external data sources, no data sinks, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors. The functions are purely for input validation based on argument counts, with no malicious logic present. No signs of code injection, backdoors, data leakage, or malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple, benign parameter count validation for various shapes. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is safe and has no indicators of malware or security threats.",
