  "sources": "Function arguments (args) passed to each validator.",
  "sinks": "Return statements indicating validation success or failure.",
  "flows": "Input args -> validation checks -> return True/False.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. No use of network, file operations, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward argument length validation functions for different shapes. Each function checks the length of the input argument list against expected values and returns a boolean accordingly. There are no external data reads, no data leakage mechanisms, no malicious payloads, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The code appears to be simple input validation logic for shape parameters without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of parameter validation functions for geometric shapes. It performs basic length checks with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
