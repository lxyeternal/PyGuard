{
  "purpose": "The code provides a function to calculate the perimeter or surface area of various geometric shapes based on user input, using imported parsing and calculation modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads input arguments passed to the perimeter function, which are parsed by param_parser to determine shape and dimensions.",
  "sinks": "The code calls shape-specific functions (e.g., square, rectangle, circle, etc.) to perform calculations based on parsed data.",
  "flows": "Input arguments → param_parser parsing → shape determination → shape-specific function call for calculation",
  "anomalies": "The code uses wildcard imports which may bring in unintended functions or variables; the handling of 'sphere' defaults to calling 'square', which appears inconsistent; no explicit input validation or sanitization of parsed data; potential for shape to be undefined if param_parser returns an unexpected shape.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules with wildcard imports, which can introduce unwanted functions or variables. It then defines a perimeter function that checks for arguments and parses them with param_parser. Based on the shape string returned, it calls the corresponding shape function for calculation. There is an inconsistency with 'sphere', which uses 'square' instead of a dedicated sphere function, possibly a bug. No explicit input validation occurs before calling shape functions, which could lead to unexpected behavior if param_parser returns unexpected data. No external network or file operations are performed, and no suspicious code patterns like code execution, data exfiltration, or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward shape calculation utility with no malicious intent. Its use of wildcard imports and inconsistent handling of 'sphere' are minor concerns but do not suggest malicious behavior. No security risks or malware indicators are evident. The primary concern is maintainability and correctness, not security.",
