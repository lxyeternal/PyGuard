{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to calculate the perimeter or surface area of various geometric shapes based on user input parsed through an external module.",
  "sources": "The function reads input arguments passed to 'perimeter', and calls 'param_parser' to process arguments into 'dimensions' and 'shape'.",
  "sinks": "The code calls various shape functions such as 'square', 'rectangle', 'circle', etc., which presumably perform calculations or operations with the parsed data.",
  "flows": "Input arguments → 'param_parser' → shape-specific functions based on 'shape' value.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports modules with wildcard imports which can obscure the source of functions; no explicit validation or sanitization of parsed data; no suspicious code execution or network activity; the function calls appear to perform geometric calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code relies on external modules for parsing inputs and performing calculations. It handles multiple shape cases with straightforward control flow. There is no evidence of code injection, hardcoded credentials, or malicious network activity. The use of wildcard imports could mask imported functions, but they are used here for geometric calculations. The function's structure suggests typical calculation behavior without obfuscation. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The only potential concern is the lack of input validation or sanitization which could lead to unexpected behavior, but not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward geometric calculation utility with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It depends on external modules for parsing and calculation, but nothing suspicious or malicious is evident from this fragment.",
