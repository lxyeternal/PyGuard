  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for geometric calculations with no malicious intent. The main concerns are maintainability and correctness rather than security. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.2 due to minor maintainability issues such as wildcard imports and inconsistent shape handling."
