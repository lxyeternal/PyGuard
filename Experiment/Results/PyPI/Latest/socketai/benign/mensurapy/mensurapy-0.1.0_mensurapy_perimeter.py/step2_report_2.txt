  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes input parsing and shape calculation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Straightforward routing of parsed input to shape functions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code structures; no dynamic code execution or external network/file I/O.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected; the code appears benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; input parsing and routing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Clear, with shape functions called based on shape string.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of wildcard imports; minor concern. Slight inconsistency in handling 'sphere' (calls 'square') which might be a bug, but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent; maintainability concern due to wildcard imports and shape handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable, though the risk could be slightly higher due to import style.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Straightforward.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard imports again; 'sphere' handled via 'square' which is likely a bug or oversight, not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; primarily maintainability and correctness concerns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Clear.\n- **Anomalies:** No validation of parsed data; no malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; potential for input validation improvement.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Straightforward.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (score=0). The code is a shape calculator routing inputs to imported modules.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; wildcard imports are a concern for maintainability but not malicious.\n- **Risk Score:** Generally low, reflecting the benign nature. Slight increases in risk are justified by the wildcard imports and inconsistent shape handling (e.g., 'sphere' calling 'square').\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The code itself does not contain malware or malicious intent.\n- The main concerns are maintainability and correctness rather than security.\n- The wildcard imports could be replaced with explicit imports for clarity.\n- The handling of 'sphere' should be corrected to call a dedicated 'sphere' function, not 'square'.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.1 (due to wildcard imports, which could obscure code understanding but are not malicious)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (due to lack of input validation and wildcard imports, which could be exploited in a different context, but not directly malicious here)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a straightforward utility with no malicious activity. The minor concerns relate to code style and correctness rather than security.",
