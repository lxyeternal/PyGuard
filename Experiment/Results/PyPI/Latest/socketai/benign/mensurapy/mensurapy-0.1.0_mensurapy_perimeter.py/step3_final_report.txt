{
  "purpose": "Calculates the perimeter or surface area of various geometric shapes based on parsed input parameters.",
  "sources": "Input arguments passed to the perimeter function, parsed by param_parser, and shape-specific functions imported via wildcard imports.",
  "sinks": "Shape functions such as square, rectangle, circle, etc., which process the dimensions; no external sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Input args -> param_parser -> shape function call based on shape string -> result return.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports obscures source functions; 'sphere' shape calls 'square' instead of a dedicated sphere function, indicating a likely bug; lack of input validation; no explicit return in 'sphere' case.",
  "analysis": "The code routes parsed input to shape-specific functions for calculation, with no external network or file I/O. Wildcard imports reduce clarity and could hide malicious code, but none is evident. The 'sphere' shape handling appears inconsistent, likely a bug. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code's security risk is minimal, primarily affected by maintainability issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for geometric calculations with no malicious intent. The main concerns are maintainability and correctness rather than security. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.2 due to minor maintainability issues such as wildcard imports and inconsistent shape handling.",
