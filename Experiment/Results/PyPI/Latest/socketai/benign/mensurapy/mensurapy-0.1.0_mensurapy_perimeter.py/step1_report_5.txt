{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to calculate the perimeter or surface area of various geometric shapes based on user input.",
  "sources": "Input arguments passed to the perimeter function, processed via param_parser(args).",
  "sinks": "Return statements outputting the result, but no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Arguments are parsed into 'dimensions' and 'shape'; then based on 'shape', corresponding shape functions are called with 'dimensions'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code relies on external modules (param_parser_perimeter and calculate_perimeter) for core computations, which are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation by checking for empty args, then delegates parsing to param_parser. It then maps shape names to specific functions imported from other modules. The functions called (e.g., square, rectangle, circle, etc.) are presumed to perform geometric calculations. No suspicious or malicious code, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code structure appears typical for a computational module, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward geometric calculator without malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on external modules for calculations, which are assumed to be legitimate. There are no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.",
