{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse input arguments, determine the shape, and calculate its perimeter or related measurement using imported modules.",
  "sources": "Input arguments passed to the perimeter function (*args), and the param_parser function which processes these arguments.",
  "sinks": "The function returns calculation results directly, which could be exploited if the input is maliciously crafted, but there are no external sinks like network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input args -> param_parser -> shape determination -> shape-specific function call -> result return",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code structures. No suspicious network or file operations. Usage of dynamic imports or eval-like functions is absent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for parameter parsing and shape calculations. It processes variable input args, parses them to determine shape and dimensions, then calls the corresponding shape function. No external network or file operations are present. The logic appears straightforward and consistent with intended calculations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code relies on external modules which are assumed to be benign. There are no obfuscation indicators or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs shape calculations based on parsed input with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility function with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
