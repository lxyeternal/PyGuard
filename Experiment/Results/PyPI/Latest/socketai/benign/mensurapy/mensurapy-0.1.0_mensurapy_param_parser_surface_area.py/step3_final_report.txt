{
  "purpose": "The code provides parameter parsing, validation, extraction, and packing for geometric shape calculations, primarily for shape dimensions with units.",
  "sources": "Input arguments to shape-specific parser functions, regex extraction of numeric values and units from strings.",
  "sinks": "Data packing into dictionaries for further calculation; no direct sinks like network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input args -> validation functions -> regex extraction -> data packing -> return for calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; reliance on external validators without their implementation could be a concern if malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward parameter parsing with validation and regex extraction. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are evident. External validators are assumed safe; regex does not handle negative or scientific notation, which could be a functional flaw but not security-related. No network or system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured parameter parser for geometric shapes with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main external dependency (validators) should be trusted, but within this context, the code itself is safe.",
