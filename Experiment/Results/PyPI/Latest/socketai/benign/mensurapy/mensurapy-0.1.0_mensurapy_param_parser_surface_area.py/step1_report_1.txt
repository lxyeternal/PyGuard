{
  "purpose": "This code provides parameter parsing functions for various geometric shapes, extracting numerical values and units from input arguments for further calculations.",
  "sources": "Input arguments received in functions such as param_parser and shape-specific parsers; user-provided strings for dimensions; functions extracting data from args list.",
  "sinks": "Return statements providing parsed data; no data is sent elsewhere or over network; no file or environment variable manipulation; no direct data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input args are validated, then dimensions are extracted via regex, packed into dictionaries, and returned for further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. Functions follow standard parsing patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs. No hidden network calls or system modifications present.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically validates shape parameters via separate validator functions, extracts numeric values and units from strings using regex, and packs data into dictionaries keyed by units. No external or network interactions are observed. Validation functions are called but their implementations are not provided; assuming they are safe and intended. No signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, system access, or stealth behaviors. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to typical input parsing practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard parameter parsing module for geometric calculations, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided code. It performs input validation, extraction, and packing without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
