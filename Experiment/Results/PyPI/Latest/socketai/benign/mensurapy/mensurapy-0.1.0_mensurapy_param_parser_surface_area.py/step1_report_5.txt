{
  "purpose": "The code provides various parameter parsing functions for different geometric shapes, extracting and validating input arguments, and packaging values with units for further calculation.",
  "sources": "Input arguments to functions such as param_parser and shape-specific parsers; input strings to extract_value_and_unit for regex matching.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output packed data; no direct data sinks like network communication or file writing observed.",
  "flows": "Input args → validation functions → regex extraction of values and units → packing into data structures → return to caller.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'match' statement is relatively new syntax but not suspicious; no hardcoded credentials or secret keys found; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed; no malicious network calls or system modifications; exception handling for IndexError is benign. The code appears straightforward and intended for parameter processing.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically validates input arguments for shape parameters, extracts numeric values and units via regex, and packs them into dictionaries or lists for downstream use. Validation functions like cube_param_validator are called but their implementations are not provided; assuming they perform appropriate checks. The regex pattern is simple, matching numeric values followed by units. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. All functions operate locally, handle data securely, and do not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The overall structure is standard for input parsing modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured parameter parsing module without malicious intent. It performs input validation, data extraction, and packaging tasks as intended. No indicators of malware or malicious behavior are present. The only minor concern is reliance on external validation functions, but their absence does not indicate malicious activity.",
