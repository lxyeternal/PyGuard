{
  "purpose": "This code provides parameter parsing and validation functions for various geometric shapes, extracting numerical values and units from input arguments for further calculations.",
  "sources": "Input arguments to functions like 'param_parser', 'extract_value_and_unit', and shape-specific parsers; data read from 'args' parameter passed to these functions.",
  "sinks": "Return values from shape-specific parsers; data packed into dictionaries by 'pack_value_and_unit'; potentially passed to other modules or systems for calculations.",
  "flows": "Input args are validated via specific validators, then values and units are extracted, packed, and returned; data flows from input arguments through validation, extraction, packing, and into return statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. Usage of regex for input parsing appears standard. No suspicious network or file operations. The code relies on external validators, but their implementation isn't shown, so their safety cannot be verified here.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically parses input arguments for different shapes, validating and extracting values and units using regex. It packs data into dictionaries for further use. There are no obfuscated language features or suspicious constructs. The reliance on external validators could pose a risk if those validators are malicious, but within this code, no malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system modification are evident. The functions appear to serve straightforward parameter parsing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard parameter parsing module for geometric calculations, with no evident malicious intent or security risks. Its functions are clearly focused on input validation and data extraction. The only potential concern is external validation functions' trustworthiness, which cannot be assessed here. Overall, it poses low security risk.",
