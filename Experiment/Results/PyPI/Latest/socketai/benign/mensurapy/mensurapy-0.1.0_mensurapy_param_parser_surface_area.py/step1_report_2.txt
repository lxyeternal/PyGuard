{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse and validate parameters for different geometric shapes, extracting values and units, and packaging them for further calculations.",
  "sources": "Input arguments received via the 'args' parameter in shape-specific parser functions, and data extracted from 'args' using regex.",
  "sinks": "The extracted values and units are packaged into dictionaries, but no direct untrusted data sinks such as network, file, or database operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input args -> Validation functions -> Regex extraction -> Packaging into dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code uses pattern matching for shape selection, which appears standard. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns identified. No network or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly performs parameter parsing and validation for geometric shapes, utilizing regex for unit extraction and straightforward packaging. Validation functions are assumed to be external (not provided here). No external calls or suspicious behaviors are evident. The functions follow consistent, simple logic for data processing. No signs of malware, code injection, or malicious data flow. The code's purpose appears to be data handling for geometric calculations only.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a typical parameter parsing module with no network, file, or secret handling. The code appears benign and safe for use.",
