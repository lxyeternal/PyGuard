{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to calculate the volume of various 3D shapes based on input arguments, using imported modules for parsing parameters and calculating volume.",
  "sources": "The code reads input arguments passed to the volume function and imported modules: param_parser_volume and calculate_volume for shape calculations.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that handle untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities such as data exfiltration or system modification.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are parsed via param_parser, then mapped to shape functions which are invoked with the parsed dimensions.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies on external modules (param_parser_volume and calculate_volume) whose contents are unknown; the main script itself does not contain suspicious or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward input validation, argument parsing, and calls shape-specific functions. It does not include any network activity, system modification, or suspicious code patterns. The only potential concern lies in the imported modules, but based on this snippet alone, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. Error handling is standard and does not indicate tampering.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for volume calculation with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The use of external modules warrants review for their trustworthiness, but within this code, no malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
