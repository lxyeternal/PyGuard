  "purpose": "This code provides a function to calculate the volume of various 3D shapes based on input arguments, utilizing imported modules for parameter parsing and shape calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads input arguments passed to the volume() function, which are parsed by param_parser to extract shape and dimensions.",
  "sinks": "Uses shape-specific functions to compute volume; no direct data output or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> param_parser -> shape_functions mapping -> shape-specific function -> result",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The import statements and function logic appear standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports parameter parsing and volume calculation modules, then defines a volume() function. It checks for input arguments, parses them to determine shape and dimensions, then calls the appropriate shape calculation function. Error handling is straightforward, capturing ValueError and generic exceptions. The shape functions are called via a dictionary, a typical pattern for dispatching. No malicious behaviors, network operations, or data leaks are evident. The code appears to be a standard utility for volume calculations, with no suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of shape volume calculation with input validation and error handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
