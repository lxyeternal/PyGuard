  "purpose": "A utility function to calculate the volume of various 3D shapes based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "Input arguments passed to the volume() function, parsed by param_parser()",
  "sinks": "The shape-specific functions (cube, sphere, etc.) that process dimensions; no external data sinks or network activity observed",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> param_parser() -> shape_functions mapping -> selected shape function -> result",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports which can obscure imported functions; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code validates input presence, parses parameters into dimensions and shape, dispatches to shape-specific functions, and handles exceptions. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The wildcard imports could be a concern but do not indicate malicious intent. External modules' trustworthiness cannot be assessed but no suspicious behavior is evident from this snippet. The code is straightforward and safe, with low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, well-structured volume calculator with no evidence of malicious or security-threatening behavior. The minimal concern is the use of wildcard imports, which should be refined for clarity, but do not constitute a security risk. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use.",
