  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, well-structured volume calculator with no evidence of malicious or security-threatening behavior. The minimal concern is the use of wildcard imports, which should be refined for clarity, but do not constitute a security risk. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use."
