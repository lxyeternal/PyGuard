  "flows": "Input parameters (cfg, name) -> template selection -> Path construction -> generate method",
  "anomalies": "Use of Path.cwd().parts[-1] concatenated with template file suffix; no obvious malicious code or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code imports configuration and logging modules, and defines a function do_gen that processes a configuration object and an optional template name. It retrieves templates from cfg, verifies the existence of the specified template or defaults, and constructs a filename based on the current working directory's last path segment and the template's suffix. The generate method is called on the selected template with the constructed filename. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data exfiltration observed. The filename construction is simple and based on current directory and template suffix, which is benign. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward template processing function that generates filenames and calls a generate method. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on static analysis.",
