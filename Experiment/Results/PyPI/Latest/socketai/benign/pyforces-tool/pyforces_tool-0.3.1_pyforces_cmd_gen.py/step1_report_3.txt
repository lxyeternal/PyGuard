  "flows": "Reading cfg.templates and cfg.default_template -> constructing filename f -> calling template.generate(f)",
  "anomalies": "None apparent; standard use of configuration and Path library; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves templates from a configuration object, checks for a specific template name, and constructs a filename based on the current directory. It then calls a generate method on the template object. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic. No user input, network activity, or insecure data handling observed. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform a standard template selection and filename generation task without malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
