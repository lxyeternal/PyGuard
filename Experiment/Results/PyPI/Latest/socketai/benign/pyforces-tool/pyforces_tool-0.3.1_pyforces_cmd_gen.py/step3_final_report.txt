  "purpose": "Generate a filename based on the current directory name and a selected template, then invoke the template's generate method.",
  "sources": "Current working directory path (Path.cwd()), template.path.suffix, cfg.templates, cfg.default_template",
  "sinks": "template.generate(f)",
  "flows": "Path.cwd().parts[-1] + template.path.suffix -> template.generate(f)",
  "anomalies": "Filename constructed solely from directory name and template suffix; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward template selection based on input or default, constructs a filename from the current directory name and template suffix, then calls generate. No malicious behaviors, network activity, or code injection are present. The filename construction is benign, and no obfuscation or vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe template filename generator with no malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
