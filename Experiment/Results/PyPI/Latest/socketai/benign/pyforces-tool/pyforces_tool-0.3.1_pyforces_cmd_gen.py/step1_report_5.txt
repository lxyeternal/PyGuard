  "purpose": "The code generates a filename based on the current directory name and a selected template, then calls a generate method on that template.",
  "sources": "cfg.templates, cfg.default_template, cfg (parameters), Path.cwd()",
  "sinks": "template.generate(f)",
  "flows": "Reading cfg.templates and cfg.default_template -> determining template -> constructing filename -> calling generate on template with filename",
  "anomalies": "Use of Path.cwd().parts[-1] to derive filename may be unconventional but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns observed; no external data sources or command execution present",
  "analysis": "The code accesses configuration data to select a template, either by name or default index. It then constructs a filename by concatenating the current working directory's name with the template's suffix, and calls generate() on the template object with this filename. The code appears straightforward, with no indications of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. It relies on external configuration and object methods, but these are typical for such context. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign template generator that constructs filenames and invokes a generate method. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident from this fragment.",
