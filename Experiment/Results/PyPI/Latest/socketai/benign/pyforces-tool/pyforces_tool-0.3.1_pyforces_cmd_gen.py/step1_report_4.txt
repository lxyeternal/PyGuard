  "purpose": "The code generates a filename based on the current directory and a template, then calls a generate method on the template.",
  "sources": "cfg.templates, cfg.default_template, Path.cwd()",
  "sinks": "template.generate(f)",
  "flows": "cfg.templates / cfg.default_template -> template -> generate -> filename f",
  "anomalies": "Uses Path.cwd().parts[-1] + suffix to generate filename, which is safe; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves a template based on a provided name or default, then constructs a filename by appending the template's suffix to the current directory name. It then calls generate on the template object. There are no evident data leaks, injection points, or malicious network activity. The code uses standard library functions and a configuration object. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic is present. The use of Path and template generation appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward template selection and filename generation process with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It handles template selection and filename construction securely without evident vulnerabilities.",
