  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'pyforces-tool' package using importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package metadata via importlib.metadata.version('pyforces-tool').",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external input or output sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Source: importlib.metadata.version() retrieves package info; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version from importlib.metadata and assigns the package version to __version__. It performs a common, benign operation without external inputs, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no suspicious behavior detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate given the simplicity and safety of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe pattern for retrieving package version info. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerability present. The scores are consistent with its benign purpose.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
