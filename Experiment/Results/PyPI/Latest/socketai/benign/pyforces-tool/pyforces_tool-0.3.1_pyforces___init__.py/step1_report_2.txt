  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the 'pyforces-tool' package using importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata's version() function call with 'pyforces-tool' as argument.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only retrieves data and assigns it to __version__.",
  "flows": "importlib.metadata.version() -> assigns result to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs a straightforward package version retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the version() function from importlib.metadata and assigns the version of 'pyforces-tool' to __version__. This is a common practice for defining package version info. No input data is read beyond the standard library call. No external data or user input is involved. The code does not perform any network activity, file operations, or sensitive data handling. It is minimal and standard in purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate way to retrieve and store the package version, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
