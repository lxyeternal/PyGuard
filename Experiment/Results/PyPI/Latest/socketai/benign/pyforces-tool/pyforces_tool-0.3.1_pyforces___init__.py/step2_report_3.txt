  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the reasoning and scoring.\n\n**Code review:**\nThe code simply imports `version` from `importlib.metadata` and assigns the result of `version('pyforces-tool')` to `__version__`. This is a standard, well-documented pattern for retrieving package version info. There are no user inputs, no external data sources beyond the standard library, no network activity, or obfuscation. The code is minimal and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Confirms straightforward usage; no anomalies.\n- **Logic:** Correct; the code is standard.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0.1` (low risk, possibly due to general package info retrieval).\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score seems appropriate; no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** All zero for malware and obfuscation, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no issues.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Repeats the same; no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** All zero for malware and obfuscation, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion; no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** All zero.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Same; no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** All zero.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Security risk scores:** Very low (0 or 0.1), aligning with the fact that this code does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n- **Obfuscation:** Correctly marked as 0; no obfuscation present.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes needed; the code is safe, and the reports accurately reflect that.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.05 (minimal, as it's just a benign version retrieval)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe pattern for retrieving package version info. All reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's behavior.",
