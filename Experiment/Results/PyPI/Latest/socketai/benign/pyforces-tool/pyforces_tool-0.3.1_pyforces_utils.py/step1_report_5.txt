  "purpose": "Utility functions for user input, headers parsing, and file handling in a programming contest or similar environment.",
  "sources": "Input functions (input()), file globbing (glob.glob), environment path (Path.cwd()), headers dictionary, standard input prompts.",
  "sinks": "Input from user (potential for injection or misleading input), file path handling, print statements (output).",
  "flows": "User input flows through input_index and input_y_or_n to control program flow, headers parsing extracts data from provided headers dictionary, get_current_contest_problem_id derives contest and problem IDs from current directory path, get_current_cpp_file identifies C++ source files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. The code contains no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, and no malicious payloads. It primarily deals with user interaction and file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard input validation, path parsing, and file searching without any malicious intent. The headers parsing function assumes a specific structure but does not execute or process untrusted data in a harmful way. The input functions are typical for CLI tools, with proper handling of user inputs. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign utility functions intended for user interaction, headers processing, and file handling in a coding environment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The functions are straightforward and do not perform any harmful actions.",
