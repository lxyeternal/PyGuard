{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for user input, parsing HTTP headers, and retrieving contest/problem identifiers and C++ files in a directory.",
  "sources": "User input via input() calls, headers dictionary input to parse_firefox_http_headers(), current working directory parts, glob for matching *.cpp files.",
  "sinks": "Input validation loops could be a sink for potential user manipulation, but no data leaks or unsafe operations are directly observed.",
  "flows": "User inputs flow through input_index() and input_y_or_n() to control program logic; headers data is processed and returned; directory information is retrieved via get_current_contest_problem_id() and get_current_cpp_file().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution. Use of input prompts and directory listing is typical utility behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code contains user input functions with validation, parsing of HTTP headers, and directory-based retrieval functions. The input functions handle user prompts securely with validation, and the header parsing extracts headers safely. Directory functions use glob and Path, with basic checks. No evidence of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution is present. No insecure practices such as unsafe SQL or environment variable misuse are observed. All operations appear standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is utility in nature, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs typical input handling, data parsing, and filesystem operations securely. No malicious signals or malware indicators are detected.",
