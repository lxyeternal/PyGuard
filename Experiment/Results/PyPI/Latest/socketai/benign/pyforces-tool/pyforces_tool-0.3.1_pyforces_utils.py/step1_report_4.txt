{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for user input, header parsing, and file retrieval in a contest/problem context.",
  "sources": "Input functions (`input_index`, `input_y_or_n`), header parsing (`parse_firefox_http_headers`), file system access (`get_current_cpp_file`, `get_current_contest_problem_id`).",
  "sinks": "User input handling and file access; no untrusted data flow leading to sensitive sinks like network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "User input is processed and validated; header data is parsed; file discovery is performed based on glob patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. Functions are straightforward; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles user input, header parsing, and file listing with validation. The `parse_firefox_http_headers` function extracts headers from a nested data structure, which could be misused if maliciously crafted headers are supplied. However, it appears designed for benign header processing. The file retrieval uses glob to find `.cpp` files, with no apparent malicious intent. Input functions validate user responses properly. There are no network calls, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no backdoors or suspicious behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with functions for input validation, header parsing, and file listing. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code performs typical utility tasks without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
