  "purpose": "Utility functions for user input, HTTP header parsing, contest problem ID extraction, and C++ file detection in the filesystem.",
  "sources": "User input prompts, headers dictionary, current working directory parts, filesystem glob for .cpp files.",
  "sinks": "Input functions process untrusted user input; header parsing processes headers that could be crafted maliciously; filesystem functions access files based on current directory and glob patterns.",
  "flows": "User input functions receive data from stdin; parse_firefox_http_headers reads headers dictionary; get_current_contest_problem_id extracts parts from current directory path; get_current_cpp_file lists and accesses .cpp files.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected. Header parsing assumes a specific structure but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions with straightforward logic. No network activity, code injection, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. Header parsing could be misused if headers are maliciously crafted, but as implemented, it only processes data. Filesystem access is safe, with checks for multiple or missing files. User input handling is standard and secure. The overall structure indicates benign utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.2) are consistent with the analysis. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
