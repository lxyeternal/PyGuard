{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for user input, header parsing, and file handling related to contest problems.",
  "sources": "User input via input() calls, glob.glob for file detection, and access to current working directory via Path.cwd().",
  "sinks": "None directly involving untrusted data leading to security effects. No data output, external network, or sensitive information handling is present.",
  "flows": "User inputs are read and validated; directory parts are parsed to identify contest and problem IDs; files are listed from the filesystem.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code segments, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No external network calls or insecure handling of data observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical utility functions without any external data transmission or suspicious behaviors. Input validation is straightforward. File handling uses glob to locate C++ source files, which is standard. Directory parsing assumes specific structure but does not manipulate data maliciously. Header parsing function processes provided headers without external network usage. Overall, the code appears to be for legitimate purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign and intended for utility within a contest environment. No malicious behavior, security risks, or malware are identified.",
