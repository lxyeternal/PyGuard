  "purpose": "Utility functions for user input, HTTP header parsing, and file management, likely part of a larger project involving contest problem handling.",
  "sources": "Input functions reading from stdin, Path.cwd() for current directory, glob.glob() for file listing, headers dictionary in parse_firefox_http_headers.",
  "sinks": "Input prompts, print statements, Path and glob functions, dictionary manipulation, and returning data structures.",
  "flows": "User input flows from stdin to validation logic, headers processing flows from a headers dict to a new headers dict, current contest problem ID derives from current directory path, file list is obtained from filesystem.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The functions perform straightforward, expected operations. No obfuscated or misleading code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements simple input validation functions, HTTP header parsing, and file management. It relies on user input, filesystem access, and path parsing. No network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident. The header parsing function processes a headers dictionary, but in a typical usage scenario, this is standard. The file detection function is safe, with print statements for user feedback. No dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behavior are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving utility purposes without any malicious intent or suspicious patterns. It handles user input, file listing, and header processing securely and transparently.",
