  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step, considering potential security issues, malicious signals, and the consistency of the scores.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Utility functions for user input (`input_index`, `input_y_or_n`)\n- Parsing HTTP headers (`parse_firefox_http_headers`)\n- Retrieving contest/problem IDs based on directory structure (`get_current_contest_problem_id`)\n- Finding C++ source files in the current directory (`get_current_cpp_file`)\n\n**Review of the reports:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard utility functions, no external or suspicious data sources.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, typical utility code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, no external or malicious data.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.2) due to filesystem and input handling, but still benign.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- Same as above, with similar reasoning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- Similar analysis, no malicious signals.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly elevated securityRisk, but justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- Same utility functions, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Key observations:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature. There are no signs of malicious payloads, network activity, or code injection.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly varied (0 or 0.2), reflecting the minimal filesystem and user input handling, but nothing malicious or dangerous.\n\n### Critical points:\n- The `parse_firefox_http_headers` function processes headers but assumes a specific structure. If supplied malicious headers, it could cause issues, but as implemented, it’s safe.\n- The directory and file handling functions are standard and do not pose security risks.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is standard utility code with no malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The slight security risk scores (0.2) are justified due to filesystem access and user input, but no actual vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Security risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to filesystem and input handling, but no real risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The code is safe, and the scoring reflects that.",
