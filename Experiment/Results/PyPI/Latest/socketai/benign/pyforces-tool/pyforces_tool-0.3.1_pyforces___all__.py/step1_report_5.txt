  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python script performing some data processing or functionality as intended by the author.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly evident; if environment variables or input() functions are used, those are potential data sources. In the provided code, no explicit sources of untrusted data are identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file operations, or system commands if present. No such sinks are evident in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are identified; the code seems straightforward without data passed from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated parts, or unusual behavior are apparent in the code. The code structure and variable usage seem standard.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review shows the code lacks external input handling, complex or dynamic code execution, or malicious payloads. It appears to be a benign, standard implementation without signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. No anomalous behaviors or security risks are detected based on the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a typical, safe Python script with no evidence of malware, suspicious data flows, or security vulnerabilities.",
