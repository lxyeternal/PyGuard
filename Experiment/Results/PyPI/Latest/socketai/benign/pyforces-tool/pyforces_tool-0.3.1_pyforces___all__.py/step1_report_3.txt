  "sources": "Potential sources include input functions, environment variables, or imported modules that read external data; however, no specific sources are identifiable without the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file writing, or executing system commands; none are explicitly identified without the code.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks cannot be established without the actual code, so no source-to-sink paths can be confirmed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without reviewing the actual code. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious constructs, or unusual code patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of provided code, a detailed analysis cannot be performed. The review process relies on examining code structure, data handling, and behavior, which are not available.",
