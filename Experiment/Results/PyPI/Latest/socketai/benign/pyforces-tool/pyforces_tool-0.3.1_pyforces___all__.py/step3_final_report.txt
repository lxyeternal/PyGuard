  "purpose": "This code is a straightforward Python script with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. It appears benign and standard.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from standard input (if any) and defines functions or variables within the script itself.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections or file writes if present, but none are detected or implied in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through functions or variables to outputs or side effects, but no suspicious flows are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or network activity indicates a benign nature. The confidence in this assessment is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious or obfuscated characteristics. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is set to 0. The overall assessment confirms a safe dependency with a very low security concern.",
