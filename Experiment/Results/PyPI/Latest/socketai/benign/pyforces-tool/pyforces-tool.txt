The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal typical security concerns. The overall assessment confirms the code's benign nature."

The primary concern is external input validation to prevent command injection. The scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and a low to moderate risk score are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
