  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard testing framework with low internal security risk. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The primary concern is external input validation to prevent command injection. The scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and a low to moderate risk score are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
