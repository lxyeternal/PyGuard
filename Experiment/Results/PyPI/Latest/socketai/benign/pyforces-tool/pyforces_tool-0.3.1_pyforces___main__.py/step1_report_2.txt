{
  "purpose": "The code acts as a wrapper to execute the main function from the 'pyforces.cmd.main' module, handling KeyboardInterrupt exceptions gracefully.",
  "sources": "Imports 'main' from 'pyforces.cmd.main', which suggests it reads data or commands from that module during execution.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code calls 'cmd_main()' which may contain its own sinks, but this code itself does not handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code flow is straightforward: calls 'cmd_main()' inside a try-except block for KeyboardInterrupt; no other data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily serves as a launcher for 'cmd_main'. It handles KeyboardInterrupt to prevent traceback on manual interruption. No suspicious logic, data leaks, or malicious code is evident. Since the core functionality is delegated to 'pyforces.cmd.main', the security of the overall behavior depends on that module, but within this code, there are no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is unlikely to be malicious but relies on the security of the imported module. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
