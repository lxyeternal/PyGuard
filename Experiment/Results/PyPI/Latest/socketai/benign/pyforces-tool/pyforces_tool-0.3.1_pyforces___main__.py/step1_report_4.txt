{
  "purpose": "A wrapper script that imports and executes the main function from the 'pyforces.cmd.main' module, handling KeyboardInterrupt exceptions gracefully.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'main' from 'pyforces.cmd.main'; invocation of 'cmd_main()' within the main() function.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'cmd_main()' could potentially execute untrusted code depending on its implementation, but this code itself does not handle untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Import of 'cmd_main' -> execution of 'cmd_main()' inside try block -> potential execution of underlying code in 'pyforces.cmd.main' module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, minimal, and appears to serve as a command-line entry point. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a main function from a module within the 'pyforces' package, then defines a main() function that calls 'cmd_main()' inside a try-except block to handle KeyboardInterrupt gracefully. When executed directly, it runs main(). The code is a simple wrapper with no complex logic, no data processing, and no external data handling or network activity. It does not contain any malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. Its security impact entirely depends on the implementation of 'pyforces.cmd.main.main', which is not provided, but this code itself shows no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard entry point wrapper for a command-line interface, with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on the underlying 'pyforces.cmd.main' module, but this code snippet alone is benign.",
