  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code is a minimal script that imports `main` from `pyforces.cmd.main` and executes it within a try-except block handling `KeyboardInterrupt`.\n- All reports agree that this is a straightforward CLI wrapper with no suspicious or malicious code visible in this snippet.\n- There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or anomalies detected.\n- The core functionality and potential risks depend on the implementation of `pyforces.cmd.main.main`, which is external and not provided here.\n\n**2. Logical, Reasoning, or Summary Flaws:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the code itself is benign and primarily acts as a wrapper.\n- They acknowledge that security concerns depend on the external module, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n- No flawed reasoning or logical errors are evident in the reports.\n\n**3. Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: Very low (0.1 or 0.2)\n- These scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n- The high confidence levels (mostly 0.9 or 1) are justified given the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- Since the code is a simple wrapper with no apparent malicious intent, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n**5. Malware Score Reflection:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code's content.\n- The external `pyforces.cmd.main` could potentially contain malicious code, but this cannot be assessed here.\n- The current malware score appropriately reflects the absence of malicious behavior in this snippet.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- The reports reasonably avoid making unwarranted assumptions about the external module.\n- They note that security depends on `pyforces.cmd.main`, which is prudent.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the analysis.\n- The low security risk and malware scores are justified given the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected in this code snippet.\n\n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation present.\n\n**Estimated Security Risk Score:** 0.1 — Very low, given the benign nature of the code, with the caveat that external dependencies could introduce risks.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis code is a simple, benign CLI wrapper that delegates execution to an external module. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks within this fragment. The overall risk remains minimal, assuming the external module is secure.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Keep the current low scores.\n- Monitor the external `pyforces.cmd.main` module for potential issues.\n- No further action needed based on this snippet alone.",
