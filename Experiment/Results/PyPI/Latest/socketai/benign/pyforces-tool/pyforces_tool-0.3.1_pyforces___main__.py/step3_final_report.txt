{
  "purpose": "A minimal CLI wrapper that imports and executes the main function from an external module, handling KeyboardInterrupt exceptions.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'pyforces.cmd.main', invocation of 'cmd_main()' within 'main()' function, execution guard '__main__'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'cmd_main()' which may execute external code; no direct sinks within this snippet.",
  "flows": "The script calls 'cmd_main()' directly; external module's behavior is unknown but is the only flow of execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; straightforward wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard CLI entry point delegating to an external module. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present within this snippet. The security posture depends on the external 'pyforces.cmd.main' implementation, which is not provided. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or anomalies. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk. The high confidence scores are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code. The assessments across reports are consistent and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the external module. The current scores are appropriate and should be maintained unless external dependencies are found malicious.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
