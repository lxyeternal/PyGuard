  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the associated reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code is a minimal script that imports `main` from `pyforces.cmd.main` as `cmd_main`, then defines a `main()` function that calls `cmd_main()` within a try-except block to handle `KeyboardInterrupt`. When run directly, it executes `main()`.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n\n- **Confirmed:** The code itself is straightforward, and no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- **External dependencies:** The core functionality depends on `pyforces.cmd.main`. Without inspecting that module, we cannot assess its security implications.\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**\n\n- The reports correctly identify that this is a simple wrapper around an external function.\n- They note that the security implications depend on the implementation of `pyforces.cmd.main`.\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n### 3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: between 0.1 and 0.2\n- These seem reasonable given the minimal code and the lack of suspicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign appearance of the snippet.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores are consistent with the code's nature; no changes are necessary based solely on this snippet.\n\n### 4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**\n\n- The code itself does not contain any malicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- The risk entirely hinges on the behavior of `pyforces.cmd.main`, which is external.\n- Since the snippet is a simple wrapper, **the risk score should remain very low unless the external module is malicious**.\n\n### 5. **Malware Score Justification**\n\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- No malicious activity is evident or implied in this code.\n\n### 6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n\n- All reports acknowledge that the core functionality is delegated to `pyforces.cmd.main`.\n- They correctly state that without inspecting that module, the security implications cannot be fully assessed.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are made about malicious behavior.\n\n### 7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The low malware and obfuscated scores align with the benign code.\n- Slightly higher security risk scores (0.1-0.2) are justified considering the external dependency.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment & Recommendations**\n\n**Overall, the code appears benign and straightforward.** The risk primarily depends on the external `pyforces.cmd.main` module, which is not provided.\n\n**Estimated scores based on this review:**\n\n| Metric             | Justification                                                                 |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | **0** — No malicious activity detected or implied.                          |\n| Obfuscated         | **0** — No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.                         |\n| Security Risk      | **0.1** — Very low; mainly dependent on external module behavior.          |\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a minimal, standard CLI entry point wrapper.\n- No signs of malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The security posture depends on the external `pyforces.cmd.main` implementation.\n- The current scores are appropriate and should remain as-is unless new information about the external module emerges.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** To fully assess the security, an inspection of `pyforces.cmd.main` is necessary. But based solely on this snippet, the code is benign and poses minimal security risk.",
