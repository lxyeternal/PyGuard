  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point that invokes the 'main' function from the 'pyforces.cmd.main' module, handling keyboard interrupts gracefully.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'pyforces.cmd.main' and the call to 'cmd_main()' within the 'main' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'cmd_main()' function call, which may execute commands or process data depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'cmd_main' and calls it within a try-except block, passing on KeyboardInterrupt exceptions; no further data flow is explicitly visible.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are present in this minimal code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific function from a module and executes it inside a try-except block to handle keyboard interrupts gracefully. There is no evidence of data processing, input/output operations, or suspicious behavior. The only potential concern is the imported function's implementation, which is external and not provided here. The structure is straightforward and typical for CLI entry points. No malicious code or unusual behavior is observable within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple wrapper to invoke an external command-line function with basic interrupt handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious data flows, or security risks within this code fragment. The overall security risk is low.",
