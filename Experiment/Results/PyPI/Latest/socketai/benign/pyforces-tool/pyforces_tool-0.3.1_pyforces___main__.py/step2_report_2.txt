  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the corresponding reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a minimal wrapper that imports `main` from `pyforces.cmd.main` and executes it within a try-except block to handle `KeyboardInterrupt`.\n   - There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The code's logic is straightforward and typical for CLI entry points.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues or malicious behavior are evident in this code snippet itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly describe the code as a simple wrapper with no anomalies or malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify that the security implications depend on the implementation of `pyforces.cmd.main`, which is external and not provided.\n   - The reports' reasoning appears sound; they do not overstate risks or assume malicious intent without evidence.\n   - **No notable errors or flaws** in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware` score: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: around 0.1–0.2\n   - These seem appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - The `confidence` scores are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which is justified.\n   - **Recommendation:** The scores are consistent and reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code itself is benign, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The overall security risk is minimal, primarily because the core functionality is delegated to an external module.\n   - **Conclusion:** No justification for elevated risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware score remains at 0 across reports, which is appropriate.\n   - **Note:** If `pyforces.cmd.main` contains malicious code, that would be outside the scope of this snippet, but based solely on this code, malware risk is negligible.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the external dependency and focus on the code snippet.\n   - No overreach or speculation is evident.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores align well with the analysis—no signs of malware, obfuscation, or high security risk.\n   - The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (very low, typical for a simple wrapper)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, benign CLI entry point. The security posture is very low risk, and there are no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The only potential concern is the behavior of the external `pyforces.cmd.main`, but that cannot be assessed here.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe and straightforward.  \n- The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious.  \n- Scores are reasonable and should remain as they are unless external dependencies are found malicious.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the current low scores for malware and obfuscation, and maintain a very low security risk score.",
