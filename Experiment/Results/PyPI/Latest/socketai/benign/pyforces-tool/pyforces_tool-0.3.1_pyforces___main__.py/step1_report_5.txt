{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point for a command-line interface (CLI) application that imports and executes the main function from a module within the pyforces package.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the imported module 'pyforces.cmd.main' when executing 'cmd_main()'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations. The only action is calling an imported function.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: when run, it calls 'cmd_main()' from 'pyforces.cmd.main', which may contain additional logic. There are no explicit source-to-sink flows in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual coding patterns. The try-except block simply suppresses KeyboardInterrupt, which is common in CLI applications.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a main function from a module within the 'pyforces' package and executes it within a try-except block to handle keyboard interruption gracefully. It acts as a minimal wrapper or launcher for the package's main functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations. Since the core functionality resides in the imported 'pyforces.cmd.main', further analysis would require inspecting that module, but based solely on this snippet, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward CLI entry point that delegates execution to an external module. There are no indications of malicious intent, suspicious code, or security risks in this fragment.",
