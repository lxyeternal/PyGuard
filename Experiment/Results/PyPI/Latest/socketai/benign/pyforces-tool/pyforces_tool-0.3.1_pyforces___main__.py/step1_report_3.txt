{
  "purpose": "A simple script that imports and executes a main function from a module within the 'pyforces.cmd' package, handling KeyboardInterrupt exceptions gracefully.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'pyforces.cmd.main', calling 'cmd_main()' within main()",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'cmd_main()', which may perform actions based on its implementation",
  "flows": "Import from 'pyforces.cmd.main' -> call to 'cmd_main()' in main() -> execution upon script run",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or functions; exception handling is minimal but typical.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a main function from a potentially external package 'pyforces.cmd.main'. The script wraps the call in a try-except block to handle KeyboardInterrupt, indicating a clean exit on user interruption. There are no other suspicious behaviors, obfuscated elements, or malicious code patterns present. The security implications depend entirely on what 'cmd_main()' does, but within this snippet, there are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around an imported main function, with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment. Its safety depends on the behavior of 'cmd_main()', but based solely on this code, it appears benign.",
