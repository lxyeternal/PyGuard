  "purpose": "This code defines classes for managing code templates and configuration settings for a code generation or competitive programming tool.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration from a JSON file; accessing the filesystem for reading/writing template files and saving config.",
  "sinks": "Writing configuration data back to a JSON file; copying files to specified destinations.",
  "flows": "Loading JSON config data -> Instantiating Config object -> Saving config data -> Copying templates files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution; no network activity; no obfuscated code; no suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads configuration data from a JSON file, constructs class instances, and can save updated configurations. It copies template files to specified destinations safely. All operations are standard file I/O and JSON parsing, with no external network or dynamic code execution involved. There are no indicators of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of logging is benign and standard. The logic appears straightforward and consistent with configuration management tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical configuration management and file handling functions without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware indicators are identified.",
