  "purpose": "This code manages configuration data and code templates, performing JSON file operations and copying template files to specified destinations.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration JSON files, loads template definitions, and reads template files from specified paths.",
  "sinks": "Copies template files to destination paths; reads configuration files; no untrusted data execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "Loads JSON config -> instantiates CodeTemplate objects -> copies files via shutil.copy when generate() is called.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'pickle' module; no other suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration and template management utility. It reads JSON configuration files, constructs CodeTemplate objects, and copies files as needed. No network activity, code injection, or dynamic execution is present. The 'pickle' import is unused, which is benign but could be cleaned. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are detected. The overall structure is standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration and template management tool. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, mainly due to the unused 'pickle' import which poses no risk in its current state.",
