{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse various pieces of information from HTML content related to test cases, user handles, CSRF tokens, countdown timers, problem counts, submission IDs, verdicts, and metadata (cc and pc) from a web-based problem platform.",
  "sources": "The code reads HTML content from string inputs, using regex searches and HTML parsing libraries such as lxml.etree and re.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted HTML content includes sensitive information; however, the code does not directly send or store data externally.",
  "flows": "Input HTML is parsed or regexed to extract specific data points, with no evidence of data being sent over networks or written to persistent storage; flow is limited to data extraction.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses regex to extract values from HTML content, which may be error-prone but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code constructs are present. The use of regex to parse HTML is a potential risk for misinterpretation but not malicious per se.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard HTML parsing and regex extraction to retrieve data points. No network operations, code injection, or malicious activities are observed. The functions are straightforward, with appropriate parsing logic, and no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are evident. There are no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The use of regex for parsing HTML is not ideal but not malicious. Overall, the code appears safe with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of utility functions for extracting specific data from HTML pages. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code's purpose is legitimate, and no suspicious activities are detected.",
