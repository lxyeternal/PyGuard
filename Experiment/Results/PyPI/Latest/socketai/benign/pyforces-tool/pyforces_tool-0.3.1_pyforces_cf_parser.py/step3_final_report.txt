{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to parse specific data points from HTML content related to programming contest platforms, including test cases, user handle, CSRF token, countdown timers, problem count, submission ID, verdict, and meta tags.",
  "sources": "HTML content passed as string input to each function, utilizing XPath queries and regex searches to extract data.",
  "sinks": "None; functions only extract data and do not transmit, store, or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Input HTML -> XPath/regex parsing -> Extracted data variables (e.g., handle, token, test cases).",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex on HTML can be fragile if structure changes, but no malicious intent or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard parsing techniques with `lxml.etree` and regex for extracting data points. No network activity, code injection, or malicious payloads are evident. The regex patterns assume specific HTML structures, which could lead to errors if the HTML is malformed, but this is a robustness concern, not a security issue. The functions serve legitimate purposes in a contest platform context. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code is straightforward and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, utility-based HTML parser with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The minimal security risk stems from reliance on regex parsing, which could be fragile but not malicious. Overall, it is safe for use in its intended context.",
