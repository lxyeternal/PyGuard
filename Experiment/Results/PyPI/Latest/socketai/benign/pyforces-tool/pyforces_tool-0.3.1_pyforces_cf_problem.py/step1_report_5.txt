  "purpose": "Defines a class for representing competitive programming problems with methods to parse test cases from a URL.",
  "sources": "web_parser argument in parse_from_url method, parse_testcases_from_html function",
  "sinks": "Potentially the web_parser function, depending on its implementation; no other untrusted data sinks are evident",
  "flows": "web_parser(url) -> parse_testcases_from_html -> testcases data -> cls constructor",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a specific parsing function from a third-party module. The parse_from_url method takes a URL and a parser function, calls the parser with the URL, and constructs a Problem instance. No dynamic code execution, no data leakage, and no suspicious behavior are present. The use of an external parser function is flexible but not inherently malicious, assuming the parser itself is trusted. The code appears to be a straightforward data structure with a helper method for initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a problem data container with a method to parse test cases from a URL. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security issues.",
