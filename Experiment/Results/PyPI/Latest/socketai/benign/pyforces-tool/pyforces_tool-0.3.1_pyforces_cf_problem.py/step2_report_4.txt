  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines an enum `ProblemType`.\n- Defines a class `CFProblem` with attributes for URL, problem type, test cases, time limit, and memory limit.\n- Implements a class method `parse_from_url` that uses an external `web_parser` callable to fetch HTML content from a URL.\n- Uses an imported function `parse_testcases_from_html` to extract test cases from the HTML.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The code relies on external functions, which could be a vector if malicious, but the code itself is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-6:**\n- All conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and performs standard data parsing.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- The only potential concern is the external `web_parser` function, which, if malicious, could pose risks. However, this is outside the scope of this code fragment.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation are detected.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), indicating strong agreement.\n\n### Critical observations:\n- The code is a typical pattern for parsing web data into data structures.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.\n- The external dependencies (`parse_testcases_from_html`, `web_parser`) are standard in such contexts.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature and no malicious indicators, a low risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate. The only caveat is reliance on external functions, but that alone doesn't elevate risk.\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to reliance on external untrusted functions, but not inherently risky)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation for modeling and parsing contest problems. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The only minor concern is external dependencies, which are common and not inherently malicious.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed reviews and the code's nature.",
