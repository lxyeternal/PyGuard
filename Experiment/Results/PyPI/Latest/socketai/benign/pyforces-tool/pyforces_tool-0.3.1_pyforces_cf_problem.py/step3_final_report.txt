{
  "purpose": "Defines problem types and a class to represent Codeforces problems, with a method to parse problem data from a URL using external functions.",
  "sources": "The method 'parse_from_url' reads HTML content via the 'web_parser' callable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data internally, only delegates to external functions.",
  "flows": "Input URL -> 'web_parser' fetches HTML -> 'parse_testcases_from_html' extracts test cases -> class instance creation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. Reliance on external functions could be a vector if malicious, but this is outside the code scope.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple data model with a parsing method that delegates to external functions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The security depends on the trustworthiness of external functions, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The reliance on external functions is a potential vector if malicious, but the code as written is secure and straightforward.",
