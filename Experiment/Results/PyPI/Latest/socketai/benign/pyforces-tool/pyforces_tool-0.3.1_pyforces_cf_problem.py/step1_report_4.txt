  "purpose": "Define a class to represent a competitive programming problem, including parsing test cases from a URL.",
  "sources": "web_parser function called within parse_from_url method, parse_testcases_from_html function from external module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed into a vulnerable operation.",
  "flows": "web_parser(url) → parse_testcases_from_html() → cls() instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. Usage of external parsing function appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures and methods to fetch and parse problem data from a URL. It relies on an external parsing function (parse_testcases_from_html) which is imported from a trusted module. There are no dynamic code execution, network connections, or data leaks within this code. The web_parser function is a parameter, allowing flexibility, but its implementation is external and not provided here. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward implementation for parsing and representing programming contest problems without any malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for problem data parsing with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply calls external functions and constructs objects accordingly.",
