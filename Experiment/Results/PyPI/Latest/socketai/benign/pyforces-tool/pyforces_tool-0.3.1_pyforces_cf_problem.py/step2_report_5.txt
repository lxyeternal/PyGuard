  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Behavior**:\n   - The code defines an enum `ProblemType` and a class `CFProblem`.\n   - The `parse_from_url` class method fetches HTML content via a provided `web_parser` function, then parses test cases with `parse_testcases_from_html`.\n   - The code relies on external functions/modules for parsing and fetching HTML.\n   - No dynamic code execution, file operations, or network requests are directly present.\n   - The code appears to be a straightforward data container and parser wrapper.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n   - The only external dependency is the `web_parser` function, which could be malicious if provided by an untrusted source, but this is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code does not perform any data exfiltration, code injection, or system modification.\n\n3. **Potential Risks & Concerns**:\n   - The primary concern is the `web_parser` function, which, if malicious, could be used to fetch or process malicious content. However, this is a dependency, not an issue within this code.\n   - The `parse_testcases_from_html` function is imported and assumed safe; if it were malicious, it could pose a risk, but that is outside this code's scope.\n   - The code itself does not handle untrusted data insecurely; it delegates parsing to external functions.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports give `0`. This is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports give `0`. The code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports give low or zero. Given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity, this is appropriate.\n\n5. **Any Logical or Reasoning Flaws?**\n   - No. The reports correctly identify that the code is safe and straightforward.\n   - No unreasonable score assignments are observed.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment & My Evaluation**:\n   - The code is a standard, safe implementation for parsing contest problems.\n   - The only potential risk lies in the external `web_parser`, which is outside the code's control.\n   - Given the information, I agree with the reports' assessments.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at **0**.\n- The code itself does not warrant higher scores, as it does not contain malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The primary concern is external dependencies, which are outside this code snippet.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- The security risk is minimal, primarily depending on external functions.\n- No changes needed to the reported scores.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nI concur with the provided reports: the code is safe, straightforward, and free of malicious activity.",
