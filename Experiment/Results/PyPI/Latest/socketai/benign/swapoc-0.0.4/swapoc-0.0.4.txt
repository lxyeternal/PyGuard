To better reflect potential risks, especially in report 5, the malware score should be increased from 0 to approximately 0.4–0.6 if eval()/exec() with untrusted input are confirmed. Other scores remain appropriate. Overall, the assessments align with standard security evaluation practices, with no unjustified over- or underestimations."

      "conclusion": "The code is straightforward with no malicious intent or obfuscation. Its main security concern is the exposure of sensitive data ('flag') via a shell command. The malware score should be 0, obfuscation 0, and security risk around 0.3, indicating a low malware likelihood but moderate data exposure risk."
