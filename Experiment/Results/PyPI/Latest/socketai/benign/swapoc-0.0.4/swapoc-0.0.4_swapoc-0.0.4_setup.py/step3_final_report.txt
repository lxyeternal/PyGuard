  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a module named 'swapoc'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README' file for long description; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leaks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "The description string contains 'for rce', which is suspicious but not executable or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscated code. The only suspicious element is the description 'for rce', which appears to be a misleading comment or placeholder. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the script, with the slight risk stemming from the suspicious description string.",
  "conclusion": "The package is benign; the mention 'for rce' is likely a misleading comment or placeholder. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
