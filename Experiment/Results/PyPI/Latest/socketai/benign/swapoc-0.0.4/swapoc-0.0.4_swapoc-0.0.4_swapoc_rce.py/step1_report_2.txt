{
  "purpose": "Execute a shell command to display the contents of the file named 'flag'.",
  "sources": "os.system() function calling 'cat ./flag'.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executes a shell command which can be influenced by input, potentially leading to command injection.",
  "flows": "No user input is directly used in the current code; the command is static.",
  "anomalies": "Simple use of os.system() with a fixed string; no dynamic input or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses os.system() to run a shell command that outputs the contents of './flag'. Since the command is hardcoded and does not incorporate user input, it does not directly facilitate command injection or malicious behavior. However, its purpose suggests reading sensitive file data, which could be a privacy concern if misused. The code itself is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet performs a simple, static file display operation with no immediate malicious intent or obfuscation. It could potentially leak sensitive data if used maliciously, but as it stands, it is a basic file read command without malicious behavior.",
