  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward with no malicious intent or obfuscation. Its main security concern is the exposure of sensitive data ('flag') via a shell command. The malware score should be 0, obfuscation 0, and security risk around 0.3, indicating a low malware likelihood but moderate data exposure risk."
