{
  "purpose": "Execute a shell command to display the contents of the 'flag' file, potentially exposing sensitive data.",
  "sources": "The static call to os.system(\"cat ./flag\") which reads the 'flag' file.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executing the 'cat ./flag' command, outputting sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Input source: static command; sink: system call outputting 'flag' contents.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no dynamic input, straightforward command execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static invocation of os.system to output the 'flag' file. No user input or dynamic command construction is present, reducing injection risk. The primary concern is the exposure of sensitive data ('flag'), which could be malicious if used in an unintended context. The code does not contain malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation. The malware score should be low, reflecting the absence of malicious behavior, but the security risk is moderate due to data leakage potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward with no malicious intent or obfuscation. Its main security concern is the exposure of sensitive data ('flag') via a shell command. The malware score should be 0, obfuscation 0, and security risk around 0.3, indicating a low malware likelihood but moderate data exposure risk.",
