  "conclusion": "The reports are generally consistent and cautious. To better reflect potential risks, especially in report 5, the malware score should be increased from 0 to approximately 0.4–0.6 if eval()/exec() with untrusted input are confirmed. Other scores remain appropriate. Overall, the assessments align with standard security evaluation practices, with no unjustified over- or underestimations."
