  "review": "Let's analyze this step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if reported issues are present in the code**\n\n- The reports contain only \"Empty response\" errors with no additional details.\n- Since no specific issues or vulnerabilities are described, I cannot confirm any problems based solely on this.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary**\n\n- The reports are empty; thus, there's no reasoning or claims to evaluate.\n- No vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or flaws are explicitly reported.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- No scores are provided, and since no issues are detailed, no scoring adjustments are possible.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Without any reported issues, assigning a high risk score is unwarranted.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward Enum class with standard methods; no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n**Step 5: Malware score considerations**\n\n- No malware activity is indicated or implied.\n- The code is a simple enum definition, not executing external code or data.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- Since no specific vulnerabilities are claimed, there's no basis to assume malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Step 7: Consistency of scores with report**\n\n- No scores are provided; thus, no inconsistency exists.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Code review:** The code is a standard Enum class with custom `__hash__`, `__eq__`, `__ne__`, and `__contains__` methods. It does not contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- **Reported issues:** No issues are reported; all responses are empty.\n- **Risk and malware scores:** Should be minimal or zero, given the lack of issues.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no reported vulnerabilities or issues)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the provided information, there are no indications of security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The code is a straightforward Enum implementation with no malicious or risky behavior. The empty reports do not provide any grounds for concern.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo action needed; the code appears safe and well-structured.",
