  "conclusion": "The code is intended to categorize file formats but contains a critical flaw: it uses mutable sets as Enum values, which are unhashable and will cause runtime errors. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the potential for runtime exceptions, which could disrupt supply chain stability. The overall security risk is high due to this flaw, but no malware or obfuscation is present."
