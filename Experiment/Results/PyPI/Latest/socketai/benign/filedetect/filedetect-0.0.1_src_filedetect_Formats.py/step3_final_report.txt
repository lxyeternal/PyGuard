  "purpose": "Defines media format categories with associated file extensions for use in file handling or validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines an Enum with static sets of extensions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present; the code does not process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A – static class definition; no data flow occurs at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "Uses mutable sets as Enum values, which are unhashable and can cause runtime errors; custom __hash__ implementation attempts to hash sets, leading to potential exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class with sets of file extensions as values, and overrides methods for hashing, equality, and containment. The use of mutable sets as Enum values is problematic because sets are unhashable, which conflicts with the __hash__ method that attempts to hash self.value. This will cause runtime errors if instances are used in hash-based collections. The __contains__ method checks if a string is in the set, which is straightforward but relies on the set being correctly defined. The reports are empty, providing no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. Given the code's structure, the main concern is the runtime error risk due to unhashable sets, not malicious intent. The scores should reflect this: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, but risk score high (~0.8) due to potential runtime failure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended to categorize file formats but contains a critical flaw: it uses mutable sets as Enum values, which are unhashable and will cause runtime errors. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the potential for runtime exceptions, which could disrupt supply chain stability. The overall security risk is high due to this flaw, but no malware or obfuscation is present.",
