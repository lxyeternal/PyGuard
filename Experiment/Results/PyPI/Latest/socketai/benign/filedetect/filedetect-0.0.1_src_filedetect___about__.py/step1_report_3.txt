{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a header or metadata section for a Python package, including license and version information.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded strings for copyright and license, and a version string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could leak data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external inputs or outputs; the code is purely static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward license and version declaration without dynamic or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only license declaration comments, SPDX identifiers, and a version variable assignment. No input handling, no data processing, no external communications, and no dynamic execution are present. The code's structure and content are typical for open-source metadata headers. There is no evidence of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign metadata header with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security threats. It simply defines version information and license details.",
