  "purpose": "Declare version information and license details for a Python package/module.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string '__version__' and SPDX license identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment of metadata only.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no unusual or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only metadata declarations: version string and license identifiers. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no external communications or dynamic code execution. The SPDX identifiers are standard license declarations. The code is straightforward and does not perform any operations that could be malicious. Given the minimal content, there is no indication of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard header for a Python project, including version and license info. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior.",
