  "sources": "No external input sources are present in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data processing functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are observed.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with only comments and a version string; no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only SPDX license identifiers, a version string, and comments. There are no inputs, outputs, data processing, or executable logic. The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious, such as network access, file manipulation, or environment variable usage. The presence of SPDX identifiers and version info suggests good licensing practices. No anomalies or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as metadata or licensing documentation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
