  "analysis": "The code contains only static comments and a version string assignment, with no executable logic, data processing, or external communication. It is a standard header or metadata file for a Python package. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, metadata-only, and free of obfuscation or malicious intent. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code content. There are no anomalies or signals indicating malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static header with no malicious or obfuscated elements, posing no security risks. The current assessment scores are accurate and justified.",
