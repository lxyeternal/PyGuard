{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer that imports specific classes from local modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only imports local modules and defines an export list.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual element is the future year (2025) in the copyright comment, which appears to be a typo or placeholder but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports two classes and defines __all__ for exports. It contains standard licensing comments and no dynamic behaviors, input handling, or external data flows. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The licensing comments and import/export pattern are typical in open-source packages. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the benign and simple nature of the code. The analysis confirms that there are no security concerns or malicious intent. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity justify a zero malware and risk score, with high confidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No further action or concern is necessary.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
