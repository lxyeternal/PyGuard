{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports and re-exports specific classes from local modules, likely part of a larger package related to file formatting and file finding functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads metadata comments (copyright and license) and imports statements for 'Formats' and 'FileFinder' from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or security effects; no untrusted data handling or external communications are evident.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures are present. The code is straightforward and follows standard Python module conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of metadata comments, import statements, and an export list. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external communication is present. The license and copyright comments are standard and do not contain sensitive information. Import statements are standard, and the exported symbols are explicitly listed. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply manages module exports and metadata.",
