  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a simple module that imports and re-exports classes (`Formats`, `FileFinder`).\n- No data flows, external communications, or input handling are present.\n- The code contains standard licensing comments with SPDX identifiers, which are typical in open-source projects.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no external data handling.\n- The only unusual element noted is the future year (2025) in the copyright comment, which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- The code does not perform any operations beyond module imports and defining an `__all__` list.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware: All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated: All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- Security risk: All assign 0, given the lack of vulnerabilities or risky patterns.\n- Confidence: 1, as the analysis is consistent and thorough.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code appears benign and does not pose any security risk.\n- The detailed analysis confirms that the code is a standard module setup with no malicious intent.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.\n\n**Note:** No changes needed to the scores; they are appropriate given the evidence.",
