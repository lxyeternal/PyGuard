{
  "purpose": "The code defines an API module that imports and exposes two classes, Formats and FileFinder, for use in other parts of the application.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the current module's import statements and the __all__ variable for exports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or external data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward module export definitions with no hidden or suspicious logic. SPDX identifiers indicate licensing, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements, an export list, and license comments. There are no code execution, dynamic behaviors, or input handling present. It is a typical module initialization snippet with standard licensing annotations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is identifiable based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module definition with no malicious behavior or security issues. It only exports two classes and includes licensing information. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
