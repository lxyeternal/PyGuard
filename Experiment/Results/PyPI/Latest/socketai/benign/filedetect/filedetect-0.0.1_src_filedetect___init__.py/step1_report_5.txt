{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define the module's public interface by importing and exposing specific classes from local modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from .Formats and .FileFinder modules, and the SPDX license identifiers in comments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data outputs observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; only static imports and metadata are present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of SPDX license identifiers and copyright comments, which are standard. No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from local modules and defines an explicit __all__ list to specify exported symbols. The SPDX license identifiers and copyright comments are typical and do not indicate malicious intent. No data processing, input handling, or network operations are present. The code structure is simple and standard for Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module stub setting up exports and license info. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
