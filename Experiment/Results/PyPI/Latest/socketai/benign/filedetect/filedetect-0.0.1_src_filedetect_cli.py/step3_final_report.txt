  "purpose": "CLI utility to find files in a directory based on user-specified criteria such as file type, depth, and stems.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments, including path, file type, depth, stems, suffixes, and format listing trigger.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of FileFinder.find() with parameters; no direct sinks for untrusted data leading to vulnerabilities; output is printed to console.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> parse_args() -> run() -> FileFinder.find() -> results -> formatted output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Dynamic import for formats is standard. No network activity or code injection present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that parses arguments, optionally lists supported formats, and calls a file search function. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. External modules are assumed benign. The code handles inputs securely, converting list arguments into sets, and uses standard argument parsing. No obfuscation or malicious activity is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature. The only external dependency, FileFinder, is not detailed but is invoked in a safe manner. Overall, the code is safe, with minimal inherent risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured CLI utility for file searching. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The existing scores are appropriate, and the analysis confirms the code's safety.",
