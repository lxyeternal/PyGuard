  "purpose": "Command-line utility for searching files in a specified directory with various filters.",
  "sources": "User-provided command-line arguments (path, file_type, deep, only_stems, suffixes).",
  "sinks": "None directly; output is printed to the console. FileFinder.find may process untrusted data if misused elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> parse_args() -> run() -> FileFinder.find() -> output formatting and printing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. No external network or system modification observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily parses command-line inputs, configures search parameters, and invokes FileFinder.find() with those parameters. It handles user input securely, converting string inputs into sets for filtering and providing options for listing formats. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious activities. The only external dependency, FileFinder, is not detailed here, so its behavior cannot be assessed, but the invocation appears straightforward and safe based on provided code. The code does not execute any dynamic code, use eval, or handle untrusted data insecurely. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign command-line tool for file searching with no evident malicious intent or security risks. The only concern would be the behavior of FileFinder, but within this code, no malicious activity is detected.",
