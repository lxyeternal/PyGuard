  "purpose": "A command-line utility to search for files within a directory based on specified criteria such as file type, depth, stems, and suffixes.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments (path, file_type, deep, only_stems, suffixes, list_formats).",
  "targets": "The FileFinder.find() method, which likely processes the search based on these parameters.",
  "flows": "User input -> parse_args() -> args -> run() -> FileFinder.find() -> output results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns. Use of exit() after printing formats could disrupt flow but is not malicious. No direct use of untrusted external sources or network activities.",
  "analysis": "The code parses command-line arguments to specify file search criteria and calls a FileFinder class method to perform the search. It includes a format listing feature, which outputs available formats and then exits. The logic for argument handling appears standard. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code relies on an external FileFinder class, whose behavior is unknown but assumed to be benign. The script is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious parts, and follows typical CLI patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI tool for file searching with no evident malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not include malicious payloads or security risks. The use of exit() after listing formats is normal behavior. Overall, the code appears safe.",
