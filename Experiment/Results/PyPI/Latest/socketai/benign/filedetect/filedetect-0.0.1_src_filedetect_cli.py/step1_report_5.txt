  "purpose": "Command-line tool for finding files in a directory based on various criteria such as type, depth, stems, and suffixes.",
  "sources": "Input arguments from command line (path, file_type, deep, only_stems, suffixes, list_formats), import statements for modules and formats, and the args object.",
  "sinks": "Print statements for outputting file list and format information, potentially exposing internal data in logs or console output.",
  "flows": "User provides command-line arguments -> parse_args processes and sanitizes input -> run() calls FileFinder.find() with parameters -> main() formats and prints results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious data leaks, no dynamic code execution, no unusual network activity, no obfuscated code. The code interacts only with filesystem and command line.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard CLI utility that leverages a FileFinder class to locate files based on user-specified criteria. parse_args() safely handles user inputs, converting lists to sets and normalizing file types. The list_formats option prints available formats from an imported module. There are no external network calls, no environment variable manipulations, or suspicious data handling observed. The code’s purpose is straightforward and does not include malicious behavior or backdoors. The only minor concern could be if the FileFinder class internally performs unsafe operations, but that cannot be assessed from this code alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign command-line file search utility with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It adheres to typical patterns for such tools and does not contain suspicious or malicious code segments.",
