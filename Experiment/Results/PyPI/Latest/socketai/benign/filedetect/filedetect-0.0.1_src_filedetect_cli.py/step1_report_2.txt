{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface to find files within a specified directory based on various filtering options such as file type, depth, stems, and suffixes.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command-line arguments and potentially from the imported FileFinder and Formats modules.",
  "sinks": "Outputs information to the console via print statements.",
  "flows": "User inputs via command-line -> parse_args() -> run() -> FileFinder.find() -> output results via print.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be a straightforward file search utility. The only external interaction is through command-line arguments and printing to stdout.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments to specify search parameters, optionally lists supported formats, and invokes a file search function from an imported module. The code handles user inputs safely by converting and validating argument values. The main function formats and outputs the search results. No network activity, data leakage, or malicious behavior is observed. The only external modules are standard and project-specific (FileFinder, Formats), which are not inherently suspicious. The code appears to be a benign utility for file searching, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard command-line utility for file searching with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It operates purely locally, and all functions appear to serve legitimate purposes. No security risks or malware signals detected.",
