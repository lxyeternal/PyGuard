  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, possibly related to network communication or data manipulation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, configuration files, or function parameters. Specific variables or data sources are not explicitly shown due to lack of code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network sockets, file writes, subprocess executions, or data transmissions. Exact points are unclear without the full code, but these are common in similar scripts.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input functions to sinks like network or file operations, potentially passing through processing or validation steps.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are detected in the provided code fragment. The code appears standard, but incomplete for full assessment.",
  "analysis": "The review was limited due to lack of specific code details. The initial examination indicates standard Python coding patterns with no immediate signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. No suspicious data leaks, malicious API calls, or unusual behaviors are evident from the available snippet. A more thorough review requires complete code context.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the partial code provided, there are no clear indicators of malicious intent or malware. The code appears to be a standard utility script without evident security risks. However, due to limited visibility, confidence is moderate.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0,
