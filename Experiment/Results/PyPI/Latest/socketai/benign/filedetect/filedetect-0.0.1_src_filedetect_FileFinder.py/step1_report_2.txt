  "purpose": "A utility class for finding files within a directory tree based on specified criteria such as format, suffixes, and stems.",
  "sources": "User input path, function parameters (format, deep, only_stems, suffixes), environment variables (none explicitly used), imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Yielding file paths, set operations on internal result set.",
  "flows": "Input path and parameters are processed to configure search; run method updates internal result set with files found via __call__, which yields files matching criteria; no external data leaks or unsafe operations are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no network activity, reverse shells, or data exfiltration observed. The only unusual aspect is handling of recursive directory traversal with adjustable depth, which is normal. The import fallback to a relative module or absolute import appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for file system traversal with customizable filters based on formats and suffixes. It safely handles input parameters, converting strings to enums and validating values. The traversal logic uses pathlib's glob and recursive yielding, with no apparent malicious code, external data transmission, or suspicious behavior. The code does not perform any network activity, system modifications, or data leaks. It is a straightforward file finder utility with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard file search utility with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated parts. It operates safely within its scope of file system navigation. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security threats are present.",
