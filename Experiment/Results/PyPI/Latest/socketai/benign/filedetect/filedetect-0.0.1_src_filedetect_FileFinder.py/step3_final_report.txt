  "purpose": "Filesystem traversal utility that filters files based on format, suffix, and stem, with configurable depth.",
  "sources": "Reads directory contents via pathlib's glob, input path provided by user.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input path -> directory traversal -> file filtering based on suffixes and stems.",
  "anomalies": "Minor flaw in recursion depth handling: the 'deep' parameter is decremented by modifying self.deep, which can cause infinite recursion if not properly managed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard filesystem traversal with parameter validation. The main concern is the incorrect handling of the 'deep' parameter: in __call__, the line 'if self.deep != -1 and self.deep < 0: self.deep -= 1' attempts to control recursion depth but modifies the instance variable directly, risking infinite recursion. No malicious code, obfuscation, or external communication is present. Input validation is appropriate, and the code uses standard libraries. The logic is straightforward, but the recursion depth bug could be exploited to cause resource exhaustion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a generally benign filesystem traversal utility with a minor bug in recursion depth management that could lead to infinite recursion and potential resource exhaustion. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are detected. The scores should reflect a very low security risk but acknowledge the potential for resource exhaustion due to the recursion flaw.",
