{
  "purpose": "The code defines a FileFinder class for locating files with specific formats, suffixes, and directory depths within a given path.",
  "sources": "Reading user-supplied path input, file system globbing, importing formats, and processing format parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or command execution are present.",
  "flows": "Input path -> directory traversal via glob -> filtering based on suffixes and stems -> yields file paths.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors observed. The code mainly performs file system traversal and filtering without external or hidden actions.",
  "analysis": "The code securely initializes a file searcher with parameter validation. It performs recursive directory traversal with configurable depth and filtering based on file suffixes and stems. The import handling allows flexible format specification. No external network access, code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The structure and logic follow standard patterns for filesystem operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or hidden behaviors. All operations are confined to local filesystem inspection and filtering.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate file searching utility with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It strictly performs filesystem traversal and filtering based on provided parameters, with proper input validation. No harmful or covert operations are detected.",
