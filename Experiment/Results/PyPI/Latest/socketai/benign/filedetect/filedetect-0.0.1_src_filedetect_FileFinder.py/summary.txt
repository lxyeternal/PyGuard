  "conclusion": "The code is a generally benign filesystem traversal utility with a minor bug in recursion depth management that could lead to infinite recursion and potential resource exhaustion. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are detected. The scores should reflect a very low security risk but acknowledge the potential for resource exhaustion due to the recursion flaw."
