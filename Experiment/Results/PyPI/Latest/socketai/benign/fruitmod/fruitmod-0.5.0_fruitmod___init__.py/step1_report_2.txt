{
  "purpose": "The code provides a collection of mathematical utility functions, including factorial calculation, summation, prime checks, and number manipulations.",
  "sources": "Input data is taken from function parameters; no external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The functions return computed values or print outputs; no sinks for untrusted data or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "No external data flows or untrusted data into security-critical sinks; functions operate solely on provided parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Minor issues such as 't=+t' which does not alter the value, and 'holoo' function's loop may be inefficient but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "All functions perform basic mathematical or number manipulation tasks without involving external data or network operations. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or data exfiltration. The code structure is straightforward and standard for utility functions. The presence of print statements in 'angoors' and 'albaloo' functions does not introduce malicious behavior but indicates standard output usage. No malicious behaviors or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of mathematical utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign collection of functions, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
