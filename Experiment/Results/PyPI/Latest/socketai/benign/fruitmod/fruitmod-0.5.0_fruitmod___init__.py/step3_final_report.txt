{
  "purpose": "Collection of mathematical utility functions performing calculations such as factorial, summation, GCD, prime checking, and number manipulations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (e.g., n, a, b), local variables within functions",
  "sinks": "Print statements in 'angoor' and 'albaloo' functions, return statements",
  "flows": "Input parameters processed through computations, with some functions printing data or returning results based on input",
  "anomalies": "Minor bugs such as 't=+t' instead of 't+=1', inefficient algorithms (e.g., GCD via decrement), flawed logic in 'kivi' (perfect number check), and unusual implementations (e.g., 'porteghal' reducing n until perfect square). No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple mathematical functions with straightforward logic. No external data sources or network activity are present. The minor bugs are typical coding errors and do not introduce security vulnerabilities. The functions do not perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system modifications. The print statements are benign and used for output. No signs of obfuscation or malware are observed. The overall security risk is minimal, with a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0. The low security risk score of 0.2 reflects minor coding flaws but no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of mathematical utility functions with minor implementation errors. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
