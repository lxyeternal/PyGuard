{
  "purpose": "Collection of various mathematical and utility functions, such as factorial, summation, prime checking, palindrome, and number manipulation.",
  "sources": "Input data read from function parameters; no external data sources or user input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no output to external systems, no data exfiltration, or system modification.",
  "flows": "Function inputs are processed locally without external data influence; no flow of untrusted data to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Some functions contain logical errors or unnecessary operations (e.g., 't=+1' instead of 't+=1', 'return' without output, or loops with potentially infinite conditions). No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple mathematical functions, some of which have logical or implementation flaws, but none appear malicious. Functions like 'kivi' and 'khiar' check for prime numbers; 'havij' reverses a number; 'ananas' generates Fibonacci numbers. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior are detected. No external network communication, system modification, or data exfiltration is present. The code is straightforward and does not exhibit obfuscation or hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a collection of mathematical utility functions with no malicious intent. No indicators of malware, backdoors, or security risks are present. Minor logical issues are noted but do not impact security. Overall, the package seems safe based on this analysis.",
