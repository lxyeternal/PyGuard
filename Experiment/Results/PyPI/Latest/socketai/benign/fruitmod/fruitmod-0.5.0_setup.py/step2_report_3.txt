  "review": "Let's carefully analyze the provided setup.py code and the corresponding reports.\n\n**Code Review:**\n- The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python module.\n- It imports `setuptools`, reads the `README.md` for a long description, and calls `setup()` with static, well-known package metadata.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, network activity, or handling of untrusted input.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present.\n- The code is straightforward and aligns with common packaging practices.\n\n**Assessment of the Reports:**\n- All five reports uniformly conclude that the script is benign, with no malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks.\n- They note the absence of obfuscation, external data handling, or dynamic execution.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and the malware scores are 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- One report assigns a small security risk (0.1), which seems to be a conservative estimate considering the minimal code involved.\n\n**Critical Evaluation:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; the code is a typical setup script.\n- No anomalies, suspicious flows, or vulnerabilities are identified.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0) are appropriate given the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, safe setup script with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and should remain as they are.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final note:**\n- No further action needed; the code is safe and the reports are accurate.",
