  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'fruitmod' including reading long description from README.md",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, importing setuptools, calling setup()",
  "targets": "No specific untrusted data sinks; setup process uses static strings and file content",
  "flows": "Reading file -> passing parameters to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no use of dynamic execution or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools. It reads a README.md file for the long description, then calls setup() with static and derived metadata. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or unusual code flows. The code is straightforward and typical for package setup. No suspicious sources, sinks, or flows are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions solely to configure package metadata using standard practices.",
