{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'fruitmod' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long_description, static string values for package metadata (name, version, author, etc.)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data outputs or insecure data handling points",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' -> use data in setup() function for package configuration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, no dynamic execution or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for packaging, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with static package metadata. All operations are standard for Python package configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data flows, or obfuscated code. The code only handles package metadata and file reading, with no network or sensitive data processing.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard package configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs typical setup operations for a Python package without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
