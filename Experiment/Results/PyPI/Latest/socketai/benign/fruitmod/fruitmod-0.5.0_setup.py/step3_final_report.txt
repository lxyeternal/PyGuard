  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to configure package metadata and read long description from README.md.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "File reading flow from README.md to long_description parameter.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no dynamic or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports setuptools, reads a local README.md file for the long description, and calls setup() with static package metadata such as name, version, author, and classifiers. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscation, or handling of untrusted input. The code aligns with standard packaging practices and contains no secrets or suspicious patterns. All reports confirm its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores, mostly 0 or 0.1, which are appropriate given the simplicity and safety of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content. No modifications are necessary.",
