  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python module named 'fruitmod'.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; static data in setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only reading a local file and defining package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup using setuptools, reading a README file for description and defining package metadata. No external input is processed during execution beyond reading a local file. There are no network operations, code execution, or data leaks. The code follows common patterns for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is benign, implementing standard packaging procedures without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
