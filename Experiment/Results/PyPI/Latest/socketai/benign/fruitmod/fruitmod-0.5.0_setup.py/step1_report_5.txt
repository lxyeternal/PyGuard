  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python module named 'fruitmod'.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file to obtain long description, and uses setuptools to configure package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that lead to security vulnerabilities; no external data outputs or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md → passes content to setup() for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of standard packaging practices. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py for Python packaging, reading a README file and configuring package metadata with setuptools. There are no inputs from untrusted sources beyond reading a local file, which is a standard practice. No external network calls, no code execution based on external data, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious intent or security risks are evident based on this code.",
