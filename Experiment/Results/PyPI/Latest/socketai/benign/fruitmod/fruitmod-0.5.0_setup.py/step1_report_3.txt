{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'fruitmod' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'README.md' file, static package setup parameters",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from sources to sinks indicating malicious activity",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior; use of standard setup.py pattern with no obfuscation or hidden code",
  "analysis": "The script reads a local README.md file for long description, then calls setup() with static package information such as name, version, author, and package requirements. The code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and does not perform any dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling that could indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical, benign setup script for a Python package without any malicious features or security risks.",
