  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and alignment of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Clearly describes the code as a wrapper around 'libellc.so' for light curve calculation. No anomalies detected.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, no backdoors, no obfuscation. The use of external shared library is standard in scientific code, though it introduces a potential attack vector if the library is malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion states that the code appears legitimate, with a high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and security risk is 0.2, reflecting the potential risk from the external library but not from the script itself.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's reasoning is sound. The code is a typical scientific wrapper with no malicious intent apparent. The malware score of 0 is justified, assuming the shared library is trusted. The security risk is low but not zero, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1, detailed and consistent.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, standard external library use.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), malware score 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the reasoning aligns with the code's structure. The external library's trustworthiness is outside the script's scope. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Same pattern, detailed explanation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious indicators, no obfuscation, standard scientific code pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly higher confidence (0.95), malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent reasoning. The external library remains the primary concern but is outside the script's control. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to previous reports.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, standard scientific wrapper pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nReasoning is consistent. The external library could be a vector if compromised, but the script itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Consistent with previous reports.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behaviors, no obfuscation, standard external library use.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The external library is the main external risk, but the script itself appears safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary and Final Estimations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and reasoning indicates no malicious code or behaviors are present within the script. The external shared library's trustworthiness is outside the scope of the script, but based on the code, no malicious intent is detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code is clear, well-commented, and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied, mostly between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting the potential risk from loading an external library but not from the script itself.\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware:** **0**  \nThe code is a standard scientific wrapper with no malicious features.\n\n**Obfuscated:** **0**  \nNo obfuscation detected.\n\n**Risk:** **0.1**  \nThe main risk stems from the external shared library, which cannot be assessed here. The script itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent and justified. The code is a legitimate scientific interface, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The external library remains a potential attack vector if compromised, but that is outside the scope of this review.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and assign a very low risk score (~0.1), considering the external dependency.",
