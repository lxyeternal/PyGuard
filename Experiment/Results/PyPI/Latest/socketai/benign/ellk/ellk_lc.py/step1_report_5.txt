  "purpose": "Calculate the light curve of a binary star system using the ellc binary star model.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as t_obs, shape parameters, limb darkening coefficients, and physical properties of stars; loads shared library 'libellc.so' from the same directory.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks in the code that transmit untrusted data externally or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into native library 'libellc.so' for computation; computed fluxes are processed and interpolated for output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual or suspicious code structures; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed. The code interacts with an external shared library but does not perform any network, file, or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily prepares input parameters, validates their values, converts data into appropriate formats, and invokes an external C library to perform the core calculations. It handles potential inconsistencies in parameters such as limb darkening laws, star shapes, and spots. No suspicious data handling or malicious behavior is evident. External library loading is from the local directory, with no network communication or file modifications. The overall structure is consistent with a scientific computation module with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a scientific modeling tool for binary star light curves. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior, nor does it exhibit suspicious anomalies. Its external dependency on 'libellc.so' is standard for performance-intensive scientific applications. Overall security risk is negligible.",
