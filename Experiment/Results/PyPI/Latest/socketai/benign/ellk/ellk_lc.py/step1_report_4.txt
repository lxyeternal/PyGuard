  "purpose": "Calculate the light curve of a binary star system using the ellc model, considering various stellar and orbital parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters from function arguments, loads a shared library 'libellc.so' from the same directory, and reads array-like inputs for spots and limb darkening coefficients.",
  "sinks": "Outputs a flux array representing the computed light curve. No evidence of data leakage or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Inputs (parameters, arrays, configuration) flow into the 'lib.lc' C library call for processing. Results are stored in 'lc_rv_flags' and combined into the final flux output. Interpolation is used for data points outside the calculation grid.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears standard for a scientific modeling library. External library 'libellc.so' is loaded dynamically, which could be malicious if compromised, but this is typical in performance-critical scientific code. No obfuscated or intentionally misleading code features detected. Error handling is straightforward, primarily raising exceptions for invalid parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive Python wrapper around a compiled shared library for binary star light curve modeling. It performs parameter validation, grid setup, limb darkening and shape model configuration, and manages interpolation of results. It uses ctypes to load and call a C library, which is common in high-performance scientific software. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The external library 'libellc.so' is assumed to be benign, as it is loaded locally from the same directory, with no code provided for inspection. The logic appears consistent with scientific modeling standards, with proper validation and error handling. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code elements are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a scientific Python wrapper for a binary star light curve model, performing parameter validation and calling a local C library for computations. No evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage is found. The external shared library could be a vector for malicious code if compromised, but this cannot be assessed from the provided code. Overall, the code appears legitimate and typical for scientific modeling purposes.",
