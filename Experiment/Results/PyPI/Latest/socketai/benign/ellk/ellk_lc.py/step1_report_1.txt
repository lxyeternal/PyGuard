  "purpose": "The code calculates the light curve of a binary star system using the ellc model, incorporating various physical parameters and options for star shapes, limb darkening, spots, and orbital configurations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters such as t_obs, spots_1, spots_2, ld_1, ld_2, ld_1 and ld_2 for limb darkening coefficients, and file system to load a shared library 'libellc.so'.",
  "sinks": "Uses the loaded shared library 'libellc.so' to perform calculations, which produces light curve data stored in numpy arrays and returned as output.",
  "flows": "Input data from function arguments flows into the Python code for validation and preparation, then into the 'libellc.so' shared library via ctypes for core computation, and finally the output flux data is reconstructed in Python from results and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code loads an external shared library, which is a common pattern in scientific computation but could be risky if the library is malicious. The code does not perform network operations or system modifications. No obfuscated code features are present. The use of the shared library could be an attack vector if compromised, but this is outside the code's scope. No malicious privacy violations or credential theft observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily functions as a parameter handler and data preparer for a computational routine implemented in a shared library 'libellc.so'. It performs validation on inputs, maps user-friendly parameter strings to internal codes, constructs parameter arrays, and manages data for multiple observations, including complex interpolation for finite exposure times. The core calculation is delegated to an external shared library loaded via ctypes, which is common in high-performance scientific code. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, file modifications, or hidden backdoors are detected within this script. The external library 'libellc.so' could potentially contain malicious code if compromised, but the script itself only interfaces with it. Overall, the script appears to be a legitimate scientific calculation wrapper with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a parameter management and interface layer for a scientific library that computes binary star light curves. It contains no direct malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware within the script. The main concern lies in the external shared library it loads, which could be malicious if sourced from an untrusted source. Otherwise, the code appears safe and standard for scientific software, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
