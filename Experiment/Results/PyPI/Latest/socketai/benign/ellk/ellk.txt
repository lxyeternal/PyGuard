      "conclusion": "The Python code is a legitimate, transparent scientific wrapper with minimal inherent security risk. The primary concern is verifying the integrity and trustworthiness of the external shared library 'libellc.so'. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are present in the code itself."

      "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet and the absence of detailed reports, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is a standard scientific module with no suspicious activity. Scores should be set to minimal or zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific utility for interpolating stellar atmospheric coefficients. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The silent error handling could hide bugs but does not pose security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific wrapper designed for binary star light curve modeling. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code. The primary security concern is the external shared library, which should be sourced from a trusted provider. The script itself is safe and well-structured."
