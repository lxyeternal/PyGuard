{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface to interpolate limb-darkening and gravity-darkening coefficients from precomputed FITS data tables for stellar atmosphere modeling, based on input stellar parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from FITS files 'g_Claret2011.fits' and 'g_Claret2004.fits' to retrieve tables of stellar parameters and coefficients.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code does not write or send data outside its scope. The main output is the returned array of coefficients.",
  "flows": "The data flows from FITS files (sources) into interpolators during class instantiation, then inputs (Teff, logg, M_H) flow into these interpolators to produce coefficients.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious data handling are evident. The code is straightforward and well-structured, relying solely on scientific data files.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries, loads data files containing stellar atmosphere parameters, and constructs interpolation objects for various bands. The class 'LimbGravityDarkeningCoeffs' initializes interpolators based on the band, reading data from FITS files. When called with stellar parameters, it interpolates the relevant coefficients, handling out-of-range inputs by returning NaN. No hidden or malicious code is present; the logic is consistent with scientific data processing. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or code injection mechanisms are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific utility for stellar parameter interpolation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on static data files and performs expected scientific computations. Overall security risk is negligible.",
