  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code**:  \n   - All reports correctly identify that the code reads from FITS files, constructs interpolators, and returns coefficients based on stellar parameters.  \n   - No report indicates any actual bug, vulnerability, or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic**:  \n   - The main concern noted is the silent exception handling (try-except blocks) which can mask errors during interpolation, but this is standard practice in scientific code to avoid crashes due to missing data points.  \n   - No report suggests any logical flaws that could lead to security issues or malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues**:  \n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - Security risks are rated low (~0.2), acknowledging that silent error handling could hide bugs but not malicious intent.\n\n4. **Justification for high risk scores** (>0.5):  \n   - None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are consistent with the benign assessment.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations**:  \n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the code's behavior.  \n   - No signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications, are present.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions**:  \n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities; they focus on the code's functionality and potential issues like silent error handling.\n\n7. **Score consistency**:  \n   - The scores are consistent across reports, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score**: **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score**: **0** — code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score**: **0.2 to 0.3** — low, primarily due to silent exception handling which could hide bugs but not pose security risks.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\nGiven the detailed reviews, I concur with the assessments that the code is a standard scientific utility with no malicious intent. The silent exception handling, while potentially masking errors, does not constitute a security risk or malware.\n\n**Proposed scores:**\n\n- **Malware**: **0**  \n- **Obfuscated**: **0**  \n- **Risk**: **0.2** — considering the silent error handling but acknowledging the lack of malicious activity.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is safe, transparent, and functions as intended for scientific purposes. No security concerns or malware risks are evident.",
