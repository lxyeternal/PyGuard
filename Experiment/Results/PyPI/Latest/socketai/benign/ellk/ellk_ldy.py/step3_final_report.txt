{
  "purpose": "The code provides interpolation of limb-darkening and gravity-darkening coefficients for stellar atmosphere models based on input stellar parameters, using data from FITS files and constructed via regular grid interpolators.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local FITS files ('g_Claret2011.fits' and 'g_Claret2004.fits') during class initialization to build interpolation grids.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input or transmit data externally; it only performs in-memory interpolation based on provided stellar parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (T_eff, logg, [M/H]) flow into the interpolator objects during method calls, which then output the coefficients; exception handling may mask errors but does not affect data flow externally.",
  "anomalies": "The broad try-except blocks silently catch errors during interpolation, which could hide bugs but are common in scientific code; no malicious or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads stellar atmosphere data from FITS files, constructs interpolation objects for different bands, and returns stellar coefficients based on input parameters. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. Exception handling is broad but standard, potentially hiding errors but not malicious. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. Scores reflect the benign nature: malware score 0, obfuscation 0, low security risk (~0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific utility for interpolating stellar atmospheric coefficients. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The silent error handling could hide bugs but does not pose security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
