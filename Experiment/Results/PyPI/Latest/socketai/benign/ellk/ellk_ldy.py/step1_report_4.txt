{
  "purpose": "Provide interpolated limb-darkening and gravity-darkening coefficients for stellar atmosphere models based on input parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity.",
  "sources": "Reads data from FITS files 'g_Claret2011.fits' and 'g_Claret2004.fits' for model coefficients and band information; input parameters (teff, logg, M_H).",
  "sinks": "Returns coefficient arrays, no untrusted data sinks are explicitly present; no network or file writing operations detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (teff, logg, M_H) flow into __call__ method, which retrieves interpolated values from internal interpolators, and outputs coefficient arrays.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; standard use of FITS data files and interpolation; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code loads stellar model data from publicly available FITS files, uses established interpolation methods for coefficient retrieval, and provides results based on physical parameters. No suspicious data processing, no network or system manipulations, and no evidence of malicious behavior. It performs a straightforward, domain-specific interpolation task with proper data handling. No anomalies or signs of tampering are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a scientific interpolation routine for stellar atmospheric coefficients. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The code functions as intended within its domain without hidden or harmful logic.",
