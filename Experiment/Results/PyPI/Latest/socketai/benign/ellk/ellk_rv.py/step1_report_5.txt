  "purpose": "Calculate the radial velocity curves of a binary star system using the ellc model, including optional parameters for orbital and stellar characteristics.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from t_obs, t_exp, n_int, and optional parameters such as ld_1, ldc_1, ldc_2, spots_1, spots_2, and other configuration parameters; loads external shared library 'libellc.so'.",
  "sinks": "Uses external shared library 'libellc.so' for core calculations; outputs radial velocity arrays rv_1 and rv_2. No untrusted data is written or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input data (t_obs, configuration parameters) -> data passed to external C library functions (lib.rv and lib.lc) -> processed results -> interpolated and returned as rv_1 and rv_2.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. External library 'libellc.so' is loaded from local directory; no obfuscated or unusual code patterns. No evidence of malicious code injections or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a parameter-driven Python wrapper for a compiled C shared library 'libellc.so', which performs the computationally intensive parts of the binary star modeling. It reads input parameters and observational data, prepares and validates parameters, and then calls into the external library for calculations. It includes extensive input validation, configuration setup, and interpolation of results. The external library's source code is not provided, so its behavior cannot be directly assessed. There are no indications of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity within this Python wrapper. The only external dependency is a local shared object, which is standard practice in high-performance scientific computing. The code appears to be a legitimate scientific tool with no malicious intent or behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard scientific wrapper for a binary star modeling library, with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It performs input validation, configuration, and calls external computational routines. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. External library 'libellc.so' is loaded from the local directory and is central to the core computations, making its security critical but outside the scope of this review.",
