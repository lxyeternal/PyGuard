  "purpose": "Calculate the radial velocity curves of a binary star system using the ellc model, including orbital and stellar shape effects.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as observation times (t_obs), physical and orbital parameters, limb darkening coefficients, and shape/spots configurations.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the radial velocities (rv_1, rv_2) for the two stars; no other data is written or transmitted outside the function.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through validation and setup into ctypes calls to external C library functions, which perform the core computations. The results are then interpolated and returned.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a dynamic library 'libellc.so' loaded via ctypes without apparent verification of its source or integrity. Contains no obfuscated code or suspicious control flow. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or network activity is present. The library loading path is relative, which might be considered a potential supply chain concern if the library is tampered with, but this is standard for binary extensions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python wrapper around an external C library ('libellc.so') for stellar radial velocity calculations. It performs parameter validation, converts inputs into suitable formats, and invokes the library functions. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling is evident. The only notable aspect is the dynamic loading of a shared library from the local directory, which could be a supply chain risk if the library is compromised. However, this is typical in scientific code relying on compiled extensions. There are no indications of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious logic within the Python code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific computation wrapper for the ellc binary star model, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the external shared library ('libellc.so'), which is outside the scope of this code review. Overall, the code is secure and does not contain malware or obfuscation, assuming the library source is trustworthy.",
