{
  "purpose": "A Python wrapper for the ellc binary star model, calling an external shared library 'libellc.so' to perform radial velocity calculations for binary stars.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as t_obs, radii, inclination, period, semi-major axis, mass ratio, limb darkening coefficients, shape parameters, spots, and other physical parameters; data passed to external C library functions via ctypes.",
  "sinks": "External shared library 'libellc.so' which performs core calculations; no direct data leaks or network activity within the Python code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and assembled into arrays; then passed via ctypes to the external library functions 'rv' or 'lc'; results are retrieved and interpolated back into Python arrays for output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Reliance on external binary 'libellc.so' could conceal malicious code if compromised, but the Python wrapper itself is standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured scientific wrapper that performs extensive input validation, parameter setup, and calls to an external C library for computationally intensive tasks. No malicious or suspicious logic is present. The main external dependency, 'libellc.so', is a potential supply chain vector but outside the scope of the Python code. The code does not obfuscate or hide behavior. Scores assigned in the reports (malware 0-0.1, risk 0.1-0.2, obfuscation 0) are consistent with the code's transparency and external dependency.",
  "conclusion": "The Python code is a legitimate, transparent scientific wrapper with minimal inherent security risk. The primary concern is verifying the integrity and trustworthiness of the external shared library 'libellc.so'. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are present in the code itself.",
