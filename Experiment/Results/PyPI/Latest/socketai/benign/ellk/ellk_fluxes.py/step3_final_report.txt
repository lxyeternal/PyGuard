{
  "purpose": "Python wrapper for the ellc binary star model, performing parameter validation and calling an external C library for flux calculations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as t_obs, radii, incl, q, limb darkening coefficients, shape parameters, spots, and other physical parameters; data read from function arguments.",
  "sinks": "The external shared library 'libellc.so' invoked via ctypes, which performs the core computation; no untrusted data output within the Python code.",
  "flows": "Validated parameters are assembled into numpy arrays and passed via ctypes to the external library; the results are retrieved and interpolated back into Python arrays for flux outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; reliance on external library 'libellc.so' is standard but introduces supply chain trust considerations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs thorough parameter validation, constructs input arrays, and calls an external C library for computation. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of 'libellc.so', which is outside the scope of the code but critical in overall security. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate. The security risk is mainly due to dependency on an external binary, with a moderate risk score (~0.2-0.4).",
  "conclusion": "The Python code is benign, transparent, and typical for scientific modeling. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The main security issue is the external library's integrity, which should be verified to mitigate supply chain risks.",
