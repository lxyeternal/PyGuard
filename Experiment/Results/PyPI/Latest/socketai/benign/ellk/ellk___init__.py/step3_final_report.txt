  "purpose": "Python module for modeling light curves and radial velocity curves of binary star systems using the ellc model.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.version, .lc, .rv, .fluxes, .ldy); no external data sources or untrusted input handling shown.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that handle untrusted data; functions likely perform calculations without external data writes.",
  "flows": "Import statements and function calls within the module; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, well-documented, and references scientific literature.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard scientific Python package with clear structure and documentation. All reports are empty, providing no evidence of issues. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The lack of detailed reports prevents identifying any vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The code appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet and the absence of detailed reports, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is a standard scientific module with no suspicious activity. Scores should be set to minimal or zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
