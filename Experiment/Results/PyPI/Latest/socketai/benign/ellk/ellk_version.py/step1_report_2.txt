  "purpose": "Define a version string for the module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string '__version__' to the value '1.8.10'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink beyond the assignment itself.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a list '__all__' containing '__version__' and assigns the string '1.8.10' to '__version__'. This is a standard way to specify package versioning and module exports. There are no inputs, no external data sources, no sensitive data handling, or dynamic code execution. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign declaration of package version information with no malicious or security concerns.",
