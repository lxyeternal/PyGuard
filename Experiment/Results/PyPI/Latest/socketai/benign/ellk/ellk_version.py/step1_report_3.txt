  "purpose": "Define the module's version identifier.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string '1.8.10' to the variable __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external outputs observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only a static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares a module-level variable __version__ with a string value and includes an __all__ list for export. There are no inputs, no external data reads, no dynamic code execution, nor any suspicious constructs. The code follows standard practices for version declaration in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely to specify the version of the module. No malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation are present.",
