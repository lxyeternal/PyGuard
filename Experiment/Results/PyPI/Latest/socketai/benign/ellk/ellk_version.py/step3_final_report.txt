  "purpose": "Declare package version information for external access.",
  "sources": "Assignment of a static string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string to __version__; exported via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list __all__ containing '__version__' and assigns a static version string '1.8.10' to __version__. It contains no input handling, external data processing, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence scores of 1, and assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0. The code is a standard pattern for version declaration, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security issues. All reports are accurate, and no modifications to scores are necessary.",
