{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for packaging the Python library 'Pysotopes'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for version, description, author information, and package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data or external outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static definitions into the setup() function to configure package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The author email appears generic but not malicious. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for packaging, defines static metadata variables, and calls setup() with these parameters. All elements are standard for a Python package setup script. There are no external data sources, user inputs, or runtime data manipulations. No malicious code or malicious behaviors such as network activity, code injection, or credential handling are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
