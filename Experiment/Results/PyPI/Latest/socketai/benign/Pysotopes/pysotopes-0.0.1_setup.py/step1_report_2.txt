  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python UI library built on tkinter.",
  "sources": "Code reads static data such as strings for package metadata and executes the setup function from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or execute external commands; no network or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; all data is static and used only for package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python library. It defines metadata variables, then calls setup() with these parameters. All data appears static and safe. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. No external network activity, no input handling, and no complex logic beyond package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
