{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'Pysotopes', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The source is the entire setup script, primarily reading static variables and function calls; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the script only sets package metadata and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and uses standard setup procedures with no unusual code, dynamic execution, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup functions from setuptools, defines package metadata variables, and calls setup() with static arguments. There are no inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no external data handling. The code appears to be a typical package configuration script. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscation.",
