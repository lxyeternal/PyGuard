  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python library named 'Pysotopes' using setuptools. It defines package metadata such as version, author, description, and classifiers, and automatically finds packages to include.",
  "sources": "Static variables for version and description; package metadata passed to setup()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, user input, or external data sources are used",
  "flows": "N/A; static code with no data flow or external interactions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for a setup script",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, standard setup script with no dynamic execution, external data, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present, and the code does not perform any actions that could compromise security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
