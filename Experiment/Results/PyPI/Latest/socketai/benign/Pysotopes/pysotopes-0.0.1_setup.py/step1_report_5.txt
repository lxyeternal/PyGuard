  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging a Python library named 'Pysotopes'.",
  "sources": "Variables defining version and description, and the setup() function which uses find_packages() and static arguments.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function parameters that could potentially handle untrusted input are static and predefined; no external or untrusted data is processed at runtime.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows or untrusted data from sources to sinks are present; the code only executes setup with hardcoded values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears straightforward and typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for packaging, defines version and description variables, and calls setup() with static, predefined parameters. All arguments are hardcoded, with no external input or dynamic execution. No suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The script’s structure and content are standard for Python package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It simply prepares package metadata and configuration without any external data handling or suspicious logic.",
