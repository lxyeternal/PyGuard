  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for distribution of a Python UI library based on tkinter.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources are read; all data is hardcoded or statically defined.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows to cause security issues. No external network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the script only sets up package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It defines package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and classifiers. No input validation, external data processing, or dynamic code execution is present. It does not include any malicious or suspicious code, nor does it perform any operations beyond package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and legitimate.",
