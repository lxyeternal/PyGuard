  "purpose": "A tkinter-based GUI framework managing widgets, styles, and layout with reactive variables.",
  "sources": "Widget property dictionaries, style application, widget creation functions.",
  "sinks": "Widget property assignments, style lookups, widget placement methods.",
  "flows": "Input data (properties) -> style application -> widget creation -> placement.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of debug print statements, handling of untrusted widget properties without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward GUI framework built with tkinter, managing widget creation, styling, and layout. It uses dictionaries for widget properties and styles, and stores widget references for later retrieval. No network, file, or system commands are present. Debug print statements are included but are benign. Handling of widget properties via dictionaries could pose GUI injection risks if untrusted data is used directly, but this is a common pattern in GUI frameworks and not inherently malicious. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious code segments. The use of try-except blocks for style and id handling is standard, though somewhat verbose. Overall, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured tkinter GUI framework with no malicious intent or activity. The minor concerns are typical of GUI applications handling untrusted input, but these do not constitute security risks or malware. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to unvalidated widget properties. The overall supply chain security risk is low.",
