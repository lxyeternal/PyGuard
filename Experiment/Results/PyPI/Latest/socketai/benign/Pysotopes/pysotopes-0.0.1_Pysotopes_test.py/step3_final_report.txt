  "purpose": "Create a benign GUI application that displays 'Hello world!' using the 'pysotopes' library.",
  "sources": "Importing 'app' and 'stylebook' from 'pysotopes'; creating stylebook and app objects; defining mainApp function; calling mainApp() and wrapUp() methods.",
  "sinks": "None; static text widget with no external data or untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Code initializes style and app objects, defines a main function that adds a static text widget, then executes mainApp() and wrapUp() without external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing modules, creating style and app objects, defining a main function that adds a static 'Hello world!' text widget, and executing the app lifecycle. No external inputs, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign and static nature of the code, reflecting minimal inherent risk. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign GUI example with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
