{
  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from the local module 'pysotopes'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module 'pysotopes' within the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident from this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a relative import with a wildcard, which can obscure which functions or classes are imported and potentially hide malicious or unintended code execution. However, the code itself does not contain malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a relative import of all contents from the 'pysotopes' module. This pattern is common in package internal imports but can be risky if the imported module is malicious or compromised. Since there is no further code provided, no active malicious activity or data leaks are evident at this point. The import itself is not malicious but could be a vector if the 'pysotopes' module contains malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement that, on its own, does not exhibit malicious behavior. However, reliance on a wildcard import can obscure what code is being included and may conceal malicious payloads if the imported module is compromised. Additional context or code review of 'pysotopes' would be necessary for a complete security assessment.",
