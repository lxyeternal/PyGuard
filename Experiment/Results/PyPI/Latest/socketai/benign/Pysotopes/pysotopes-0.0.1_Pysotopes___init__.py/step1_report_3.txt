{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the local module 'pysotopes', likely for use within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a local module file 'pysotopes.py' within the same package or directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sinks are present in this snippet; the code only performs an import.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows or processing within this snippet; it only imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a relative import with a wildcard '*', which can obscure the imported content and make security analysis more difficult. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import statement, which is common in Python packages. The use of 'from .pysotopes import *' can be risky in larger codebases due to potential namespace pollution, but it is not inherently malicious. No malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior is evident. The import appears to be a standard module inclusion, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement from a local module, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The use of wildcard import can hinder static analysis but does not imply malicious activity.",
