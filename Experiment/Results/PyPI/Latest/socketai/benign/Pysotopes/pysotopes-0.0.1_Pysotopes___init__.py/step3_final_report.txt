{
  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local module 'pysotopes' using a relative import.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data or input sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code only imports symbols into the namespace.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the import makes symbols available but does not execute code or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can cause namespace pollution; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard relative import of all symbols from 'pysotopes'. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The wildcard import is discouraged for maintainability but does not constitute a security risk. Without additional context or content of 'pysotopes', no malicious intent can be inferred. The import itself is benign, and the minimal code does not pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which affects code clarity but not security. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.2) due to import style. No further action required based solely on this snippet.",
