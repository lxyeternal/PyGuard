  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which affects code clarity but not security. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.2) due to import style. No further action required based solely on this snippet."
