  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code snippet:\n\nOriginal Code:\n```python\nfrom .pysotopes import *\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that this is a simple relative import from a local module named `pysotopes`.\n- They note the use of `import *`, which is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution but not inherently malicious.\n- No report mentions any actual malicious activity, code obfuscation, or signs of malware.\n- The confidence levels are mostly high (0.7 to 1.0), but all scores for malware and obfuscation are zero.\n- Security risk scores are low, mostly around 0.1 to 0.3, indicating minimal concern based solely on this line.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n\n**Does the code contain malicious behavior?**  \nNo. The import statement alone does not execute code; it merely makes symbols available in the namespace. Without additional context, there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Are there errors or flaws?**  \nThe only potential flaw is the use of `import *`, which can cause namespace pollution and make static analysis harder. But this is a known Python anti-pattern, not a security flaw per se.\n\n**Is there any obfuscation?**  \nNo, the code is straightforward.\n\n**Are the scores consistent?**  \nYes. All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Justification of risk scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified. No malicious activity is indicated.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with the straightforward import statement.\n- **Security risk score:** Slightly higher in some reports (up to 0.3), mainly due to the wildcard import, which can obscure what is imported and potentially hide malicious code if the module is compromised. However, on its own, this does not constitute a high security risk.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The use of `from .pysotopes import *` can be problematic in larger codebases because it makes tracking imported symbols difficult, but it is not malicious.\n- Without examining the actual `pysotopes` module, we cannot assess if it contains malicious code. The import line itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided code snippet and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (due to wildcard import, but minimal overall risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to import style)\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe import statement is standard and does not pose a security threat. The main concern is the use of `import *`, which could hinder static analysis and maintenance but does not introduce malware or significant security risks on its own.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Prefer explicit imports to improve code clarity and security analysis.  \n- Review the contents of `pysotopes` for any malicious code if there are suspicions about its integrity.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nNo evidence suggests malicious intent or activity from this code snippet. The scores are appropriate, and the overall security posture based on this line is very low risk.",
