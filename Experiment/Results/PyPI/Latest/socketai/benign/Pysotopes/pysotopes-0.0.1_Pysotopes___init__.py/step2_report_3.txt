  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement: `from .pysotopes import *`.\n   - There is no indication of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity in any of the snippets.\n   - The code itself is benign; it only imports a module.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly mention that wildcard imports (`import *`) are discouraged due to namespace pollution and potential security risks. This is accurate.\n   - They correctly state that the import alone does not imply malicious intent.\n   - No report claims that the code is malicious or that the module itself is malicious, which aligns with the minimal code provided.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All are zero, which is appropriate given the straightforward import.\n   - **Malware score:** All are zero, which matches the absence of any malicious activity.\n   - **Security risk scores:** Mostly low (0.1 to 0.3). While wildcard imports can obscure code, the risk is minimal without further context.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.7 to 1), which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score is 0.3, which is reasonable given the potential issues with wildcard imports but no evidence of malicious activity.\n   - No report assigns a high risk score unjustified by the evidence.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n   - There is no claim or evidence suggesting malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports are cautious and avoid making unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent.\n   - They acknowledge that the wildcard import can hinder static analysis but does not directly indicate malicious activity.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis; no contradictions are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.3 (low, primarily due to wildcard import practices)\n\n### My Expert Estimation:\n\nGiven the evidence, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malware detected or suggested)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal risk, mainly from coding style rather than security threat)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The use of `import *` is discouraged but not malicious. The risk remains low, and the malware score should stay at zero.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. No changes are necessary to the scores based on the provided code snippets.",
