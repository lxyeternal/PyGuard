{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the module 'pysotopes', likely to utilize its functionalities in the current script or package.",
  "sources": "The import statement is the only source, which reads the 'pysotopes' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or output operations are shown.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can be considered a bad practice but is not inherently malicious. No signs of obfuscated or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import operation from a relative module. No input, data handling, or external communication is observed. The module 'pysotopes' might be a legitimate library or a custom module; this alone does not indicate malicious intent. Without additional context or code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a straightforward import statement with no apparent malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a standard pattern in Python projects.",
