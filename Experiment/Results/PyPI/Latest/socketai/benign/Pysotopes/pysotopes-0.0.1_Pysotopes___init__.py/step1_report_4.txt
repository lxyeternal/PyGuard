  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module 'pysotopes', likely for further use within this package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module 'pysotopes'.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows visible in this single line; potential flows depend on subsequent code that uses imported functions or variables.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from .pysotopes import *' is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution, but it is not inherently malicious. No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a relative import from a module named 'pysotopes'. It imports all symbols into the current namespace, which can obscure source of variables or functions and make security analysis harder. No other code or context is provided, limiting further assessment. The import itself is standard Python syntax and does not indicate malicious intent. However, the absence of context prevents a complete security evaluation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement from a local module. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent from this snippet alone. Its use of wildcard import warrants caution but is not malicious by itself.",
