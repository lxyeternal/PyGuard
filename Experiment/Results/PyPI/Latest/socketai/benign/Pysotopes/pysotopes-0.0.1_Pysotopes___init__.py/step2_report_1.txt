  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom .pysotopes import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- The code performs a relative import of all symbols from a local module `pysotopes`.\n- Use of `import *` is generally discouraged because it pollutes the namespace and makes static analysis harder.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, external communication, or malicious code in this minimal snippet.\n- Without additional context, it's impossible to determine if `pysotopes` contains malicious code or not.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose:** Import all from `pysotopes`.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no malicious intent or security risk evident.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 (low), obfuscated=0.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. The low security risk score aligns with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose:** Import from local `pysotopes`.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; no malicious activity.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate. High confidence (1) justified.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose:** Import all from local module.\n- **Analysis:** Use of `import *` can cause namespace pollution, which can be a security concern if malicious code is hidden inside `pysotopes`. However, there's no evidence of malicious activity here.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2 (slightly higher due to potential namespace issues), obfuscated=0.\n- **Verdict:** The security risk score of 0.2 is acceptable, considering the potential for namespace pollution, but not maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose:** Import all from local module.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to above; the use of wildcard import is discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate. The caution about namespace pollution is justified.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose:** Import all functions/classes from local module.\n- **Analysis:** Same as previous; the wildcard import can hide malicious code if `pysotopes` is compromised, but no evidence here.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.3 (slightly higher due to potential concealment), obfuscated=0.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable, given the potential risks of wildcard imports.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All zero, consistent with the minimal code snippet.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low, justified by the use of wildcard imports which can obscure malicious payloads if present.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with the provided code snippet.\n- The low malware scores are appropriate; no malicious activity is evident.\n- The security risk scores could be marginally increased if considering the risks of namespace pollution, but given the lack of evidence, their current values are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to wildcard import practices, which are discouraged but not inherently malicious)\n\n**Note:** If additional context or code from `pysotopes` were available, a more thorough analysis could be performed. But based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scores are appropriate given the information. No changes needed unless further context reveals malicious or obfuscated code inside `pysotopes`.",
