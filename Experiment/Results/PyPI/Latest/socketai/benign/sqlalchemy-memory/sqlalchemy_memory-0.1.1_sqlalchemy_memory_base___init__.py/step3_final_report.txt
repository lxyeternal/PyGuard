  "purpose": "This code imports the MemoryDialect class from a local module and exposes it via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .dialect module",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication present",
  "flows": "Import of MemoryDialect from local module; exposure via __all__",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export pattern, no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a class from a local module and exposing it via __all__. No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or network activity. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores at 0. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns justify these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module interface with no malicious or security concerns. The reports' evaluations and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
