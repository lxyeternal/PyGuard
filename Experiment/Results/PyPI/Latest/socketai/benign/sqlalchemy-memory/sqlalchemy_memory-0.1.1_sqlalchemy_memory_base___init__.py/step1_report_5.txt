  "purpose": "The code defines the public API of a module by importing and exposing the MemoryDialect class.",
  "sources": "The code imports MemoryDialect from a relative module 'dialect'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the import statement into the __all__ list, exposing MemoryDialect publicly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a standard import and __all__ declaration to control module exports. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. It appears to be typical module setup code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module export declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns detected.",
