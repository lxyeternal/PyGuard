  "purpose": "Define and export the MemoryDialect class for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.dialect'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import of MemoryDialect from local module; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple import and export declaration with no additional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class or object named MemoryDialect from a relative module '.dialect'. It then explicitly exports MemoryDialect via __all__, indicating that the module's main purpose is to expose this class for external use. The code contains no logic, no data processing, no handling of user input, and no network activity. It is a straightforward module definition with an export statement, typical for a package's interface file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal, standard module setup with no malicious behavior. It simply exposes the MemoryDialect class for external modules to use. No security issues or malware signals are present.",
