  "purpose": "Export the MemoryDialect class from the current module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement for .dialect import, list assignment for __all__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code only defines exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module, likely part of a package, and defines the __all__ variable for explicit exports. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for a Python package module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module export file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
