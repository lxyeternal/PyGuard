  "purpose": "Custom in-memory implementation of a SQLAlchemy session to perform database operations without a persistent database, mainly for testing or mock purposes.",
  "sources": "Data read from method parameters such as statement objects, input parameters, and object attributes. Reading primary keys, column values, and conditions from SQLAlchemy constructs.",
  "sinks": "Data modifications via store methods (add, update, delete), and returning data through IteratorResult objects. No external network or file system access is present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through various methods (_handle_select, _handle_delete, _handle_insert, _handle_update) to data store operations, with results wrapped in IteratorResult objects. Data from stored objects is used to generate output results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual obfuscation detected. Use of in-memory store, but no indication of malicious code. No dynamic code execution, encryption, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a customized in-memory session for SQLAlchemy, overriding methods to simulate database operations. It accesses internal SQLAlchemy structures and manages data via a store object. The methods implement standard CRUD operations with no external side effects or data exfiltration. The code does not include network access, cryptographic operations, or hiding behaviors. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected. Its purpose appears to be testing or mocking database interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate in-memory mock of SQLAlchemy session for testing purposes. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The design is straightforward, with no suspicious data leaks or external communications.",
