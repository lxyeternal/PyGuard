  "purpose": "Custom in-memory implementation of SQLAlchemy Session methods for testing or mock purposes, managing data via an in-memory store.",
  "sources": "Input data from method parameters (e.g., add, insert, update), statement objects (select, delete, insert, update), and store methods (get_by_primary_key).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage via store access (e.g., store.get_by_primary_key, store.update, store.delete) and returned query results; no direct data output or external network access present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters or store retrieval (sources) into in-memory operations, then into return objects like IteratorResult. No external system calls or network data flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are identified. The code appears to implement standard ORM-like in-memory data handling. No obfuscated code features are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a MemorySession class extending SQLAlchemy's Session, overriding methods to handle select, insert, update, delete operations within an in-memory store. Methods rely on the store object for data management. The select handler constructs a query, filters, orders, and limits results, then wraps objects in a cursor-like structure. Insert, update, and delete methods manipulate the store accordingly. No external network operations, code injections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The code appears focused solely on simulating database behavior in memory for testing or mock purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward in-memory simulation of a SQLAlchemy Session, with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain hidden backdoors, data leaks, or network activity. Its purpose is likely for testing or development environments, and it seems safe in that context.",
