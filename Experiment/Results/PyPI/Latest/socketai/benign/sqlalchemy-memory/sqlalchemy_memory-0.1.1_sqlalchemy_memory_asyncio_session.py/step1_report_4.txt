{
  "purpose": "The code defines a subclass of SQLAlchemy's AsyncSession, likely intended to customize or extend the asynchronous database session functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'AsyncSession' class from 'sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio'. No other data inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present since the class is empty and only inherits behavior without modifications.",
  "anomalies": "The class is an empty subclass with no additional methods or attributes. This could be seen as a placeholder or stub but contains no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'AsyncSession' from SQLAlchemy's asynchronous extension and creates a subclass called 'AsyncMemorySession' that currently does nothing beyond inheritance. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code does not handle input, perform network operations, or contain any obfuscated or malicious constructs. Its simplicity suggests it is a structural placeholder or a basis for future extension.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, minimal subclass extending SQLAlchemy's AsyncSession with no additional logic. No security risks, malware, or anomalies are detected in this code fragment.",
