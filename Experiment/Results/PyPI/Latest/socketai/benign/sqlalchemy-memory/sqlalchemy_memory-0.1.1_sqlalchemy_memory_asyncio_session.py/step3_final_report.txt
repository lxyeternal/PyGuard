  "purpose": "A minimal subclass of SQLAlchemy's AsyncSession, likely for future extension or identification.",
  "sources": "Import of AsyncSession from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio; class definition inheriting from AsyncSession.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; subclassing without additional logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "None; the subclass is empty and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports AsyncSession and defines an empty subclass AsyncMemorySession. It is syntactically correct, simple, and serves as a placeholder. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The subclass does not introduce any operational logic or external interactions. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign and minimal nature of the code. The slight elevation in one report's security risk score (0.1) is unwarranted given the code's simplicity and lack of operational logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal subclass of AsyncSession with no malicious intent or security concerns. The assessments and scores are appropriate; the security risk score should be adjusted to 0 for accuracy. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
