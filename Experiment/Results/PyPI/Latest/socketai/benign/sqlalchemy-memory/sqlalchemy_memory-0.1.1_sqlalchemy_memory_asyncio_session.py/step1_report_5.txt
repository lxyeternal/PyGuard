{
  "purpose": "Define a subclass of SQLAlchemy's AsyncSession for asynchronous database interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statement from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio; class definition",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in the code; no data handling or output mechanisms",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data sources; the class is a placeholder with no added behavior",
  "anomalies": "The subclass does not add any functionality or code; it is an empty subclass, which is unusual but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports AsyncSession from SQLAlchemy's asynchronous extension and creates a subclass called AsyncMemorySession that inherits without modification. No methods, attributes, or logic are added. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The empty subclass could be used for future customization or for code clarity, but as it stands, it does not introduce security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward subclass definition with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a placeholder or a minimal extension of SQLAlchemy's AsyncSession, posing no security threats.",
