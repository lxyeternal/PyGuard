{
  "purpose": "Define a subclass of AsyncSession from SQLAlchemy's asyncio extension, likely to be used for asynchronous database operations.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, input, or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink since the code only defines a class with no methods or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no suspicious or unusual code constructs. The subclass is empty, serving as a placeholder or extension point.",
  "analysis": "The code imports AsyncSession from SQLAlchemy's asyncio extension and creates an empty subclass AsyncMemorySession. There are no methods, no data handling, no external input, or output. It does not perform any operations or contain any malicious constructs. This appears to be a straightforward subclass extension, possibly intended for future customization or specific session handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple subclass with no behavior, no malicious code, or security issues. It is benign and standard for extending functionality. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
