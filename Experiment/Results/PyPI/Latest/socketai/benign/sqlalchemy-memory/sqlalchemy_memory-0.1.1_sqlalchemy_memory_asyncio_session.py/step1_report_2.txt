{
  "purpose": "Define a subclass of AsyncSession from SQLAlchemy's asyncio extension, potentially for custom asynchronous database interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing AsyncSession; class definition with no additional code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no external data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only defines a class that extends an existing class without modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Class is an empty subclass; no additional logic, data, or behavior introduced. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports AsyncSession from SQLAlchemy's asyncio extension, then creates a subclass AsyncMemorySession that currently adds no new behavior or data. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks where data could leak or be maliciously executed, and no unusual or obfuscated code structures. The subclass may be intended for future customization but, as-is, is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple subclass extension with no additional logic, no malicious behavior, and no security concerns. It appears to be a placeholder for further customization. No risks are identified in its current form.",
