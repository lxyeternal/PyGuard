{
  "purpose": "The code exports two session classes, MemorySession and AsyncMemorySession, likely for use in managing session data in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .base.session and .asyncio.session",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no data flows, input/output operations, or untrusted data handling in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. It is simply exporting classes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two session classes from relative modules and declares an __all__ list for module exports. It also defines a version string. There are no suspicious or malicious operations, no data handling, and no external communication or dynamic execution. The structure is simple and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module setup for exporting session classes in a package. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected.",
