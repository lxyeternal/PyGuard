  "purpose": "Export session classes for use in other modules, likely for managing in-memory sessions synchronously and asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Import statements for MemorySession and AsyncMemorySession modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or processing observed.",
  "flows": "Imports are straightforward; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two session classes from relative modules, exposes them in __all__, and sets a version string. It performs standard module setup without any dynamic code execution, data manipulation, or external network activity. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module initialization with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It serves to expose session classes for other parts of a project.",
