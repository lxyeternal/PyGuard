{
  "purpose": "The code exports session classes for a library, likely related to managing in-memory sessions, both synchronous and asynchronous.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .base.session and .asyncio.session",
  "targets": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; mainly exporting classes",
  "flows": "Import statements to __all__ assignment, which exports class names",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated parts. No external network activity or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs module exports and version declaration. Imports are relative and likely internal, with no apparent user input or untrusted data sources. The __all__ list exposes specific classes, and __version__ is statically assigned. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present. The code structure is straightforward and clean.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module export file for session classes, with no malicious or security concerning elements detected. It appears to be standard and safe.",
