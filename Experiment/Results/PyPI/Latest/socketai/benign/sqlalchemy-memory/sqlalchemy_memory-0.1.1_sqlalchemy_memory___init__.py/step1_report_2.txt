  "purpose": "Export modules for session management, specifically MemorySession and AsyncMemorySession.",

  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes from internal modules and exposes them via __all__. It sets a version string. No external input, data processing, or network activity is present. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module initializer with no malicious behavior or security issues. It serves to expose session classes for external use.",
