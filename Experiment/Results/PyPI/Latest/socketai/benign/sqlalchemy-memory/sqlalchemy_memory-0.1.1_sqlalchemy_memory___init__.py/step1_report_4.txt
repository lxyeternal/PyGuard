  "purpose": "Exporting session classes for use in other modules or packages",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no data leaks, no external communication",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns present",
  "analysis": "The code imports two session classes from local modules, 'MemorySession' and 'AsyncMemorySession', and defines them for export. It also sets a version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, external network activity, or backdoors. The code is simple and standard for module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module that exports session classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
