  "purpose": "Module initializer exporting session classes and setting version info",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules",
  "sinks": "None; static code with no data flow or external interactions",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export, no suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from internal modules and exposes them via __all__, with a static version string. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code is a typical module setup, and the reports correctly identify it as benign. No security risks or malware are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are justified given the simplicity and safety of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
