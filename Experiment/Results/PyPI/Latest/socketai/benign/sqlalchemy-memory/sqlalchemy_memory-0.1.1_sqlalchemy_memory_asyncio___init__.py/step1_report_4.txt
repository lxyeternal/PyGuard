  "purpose": "Defines the module's public interface by exporting the AsyncMemoryDialect class.",
  "sources": "Imports AsyncMemoryDialect from a relative module named dialect.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs beyond the import and export statements.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal; no suspicious or unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a relative module and declares it as part of the public API. There are no dynamic code executions, external network calls, or handling of untrusted input. The code structure is straightforward and typical for Python modules. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign module boilerplate code with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
