{
  "purpose": "This code is exporting the AsyncMemoryDialect class for use in other modules, likely as part of a larger package or library.",
  "sources": "The code imports AsyncMemoryDialect from the local dialect module.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause data leaks.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import AsyncMemoryDialect from dialect, then expose it via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class and defines the __all__ list for module exports. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modifications. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard module export code with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves to expose the AsyncMemoryDialect class for external use.",
