  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; it does not process untrusted data or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only imports a class and declares exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
