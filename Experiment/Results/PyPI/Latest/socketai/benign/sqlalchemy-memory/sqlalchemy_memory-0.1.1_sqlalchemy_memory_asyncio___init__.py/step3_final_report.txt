  "purpose": "Module declaration importing AsyncMemoryDialect from local dialect module and exposing it via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .dialect, reading the AsyncMemoryDialect class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import/export pattern.",
  "flows": "Import of AsyncMemoryDialect from local module; export via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "None; minimal, straightforward code with no suspicious patterns or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports a class from a local module and exposes it via __all__. No external data, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The code structure is standard for Python modules, and the lack of dynamic or external interactions indicates no security issues. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, with high confidence. The scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module declaration with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The existing reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
