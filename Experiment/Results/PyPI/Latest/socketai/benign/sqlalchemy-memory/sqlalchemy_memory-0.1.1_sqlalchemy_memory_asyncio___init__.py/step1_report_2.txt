{
  "purpose": "The code defines an import statement and an export list for a module, specifically exporting 'AsyncMemoryDialect'.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .dialect import AsyncMemoryDialect' reads from a local module named 'dialect'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs an import and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, unusual constructs, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a specific class or object from a local module and declares it for export. No external input handling, no execution of dynamic code, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present. The code is typical for a module's __init__.py or similar setup files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard module setup with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
