{
  "purpose": "Main class for managing scheduling operations of Fabric artifacts, including loading, displaying, deleting, and creating schedules through Fabric REST API.",
  "sources": "import statements for io, typing, and sempy.fabric; class methods reading parameters and internal state; method calls to external managers and fabric client.",
  "sinks": "fabric.FabricRestClient() instantiation; methods that invoke network operations (e.g., fetch_workspace_artifacts, display_schedules, delete_schedules, create_schedules).",
  "flows": "Initialization: fabric.FabricRestClient() -> WorkspaceManager and ScheduleManager operations; set_artifacts_to_schedule and display_schedules or delete_schedules calling FabricRestClient methods; create_schedules invoking network requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Usage of fabric REST client appears standard. No data exfiltration or malicious code execution evident. Defensive scope validation implemented.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for scheduling artifacts with standard object-oriented practices. It uses external fabric REST API client, which appears to be a legitimate SDK. Methods primarily manage internal state, validate input, and invoke external API calls via managers. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network communication are present. The code manages scheduling logic securely with proper input validation and does not handle sensitive secrets directly. Overall, the code acts as a wrapper around fabric REST API, with no malicious intent or suspicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward management class for scheduling artifacts via the Fabric REST API. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or hidden backdoors. It performs expected scheduling operations with proper validation and no signs of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage.",
