  "purpose": "Main class for managing scheduling operations for Fabric artifacts via REST API, including loading artifacts, displaying, deleting, and creating schedules.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules (semPy.fabric), class initializations, methods accepting user input (csv_source, artifacts, scope).",
  "sinks": "Methods that could potentially process untrusted input: set_artifacts_to_schedule (from load_artifacts_from_csv or direct list), display_schedules, delete_schedules, create_schedules.",
  "flows": "Input sources (CSV string/file or artifacts list) pass to set_artifacts_to_schedule or stored in artifacts_to_schedule; scope parameters used in display and delete methods determine which artifacts are affected; the schedule_manager methods are called with these artifacts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of standard class and method structures without obfuscation. No dynamic code execution or suspicious external connections evident.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical orchestrator for scheduling artifacts, initializing multiple managers and validating scope parameters. It processes user input through safe interfaces and calls other modules for actual operations. No malicious or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network connections to unknown domains, or code injection are present. It relies on external modules and classes for core functionality, which are not included here. No hardcoded secrets or unusual logic patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard management interface for scheduling artifacts. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities based on the provided code. Its operations are limited to orchestrating existing components, with input validation for scope parameters. Overall, it appears safe.",
