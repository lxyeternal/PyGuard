{
  "purpose": "Main class for scheduling Fabric artifacts such as Notebooks, Dataflows, and Pipelines, coordinating workspace, artifact, and schedule management through the Fabric REST API.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the fabric.FabricRestClient() instance, input parameters such as CSV source, and internal class methods fetching artifacts and schedules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data outputs include displaying schedules and deleting schedules, which could reveal internal states if misused, but no direct data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Uses fabric.FabricRestClient() to communicate with the REST API, processes input data through set_artifacts_to_schedule, display_schedules, delete_schedules, and create_schedules methods, with data flow primarily within managed classes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code features are present. No malicious or unusual behaviors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Fabric REST client and manages artifacts and schedules through dedicated classes. It provides user-facing methods for loading artifacts, displaying, deleting, and creating schedules with proper validation of input parameters. No unsafe or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or hidden backdoors is present. All data handling appears to be within expected operational bounds, relying on external classes for core functionality. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a scheduling module. No signs of obfuscation or malware are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard scheduling interface for Fabric artifacts, with no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks evident. It operates within the expected domain of artifact and schedule management, with proper validation and no suspicious activities.",
