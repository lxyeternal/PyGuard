  "purpose": "Main class for managing scheduling operations of Fabric artifacts via REST API, including loading artifacts, displaying, deleting, and creating schedules.",
  "sources": "Imports (semPy.fabric as fabric), class constructor (initializes fabric.FabricRestClient), method parameters (csv_source, artifacts, scope).",
  "sinks": "fabric.FabricRestClient() calls for API interactions, print statements for user messages.",
  "flows": "Initialization of FabricRestClient -> Storage of client in self.client -> Use in ScheduleManager and other managers -> API calls via self.client within ScheduleManager methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variables observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward orchestrator for scheduling artifacts, relying on external managers and a REST client. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The use of fabric.FabricRestClient() suggests interaction with an external API, but no suspicious or malicious API calls are evident. The code includes validation for scope parameters and ensures silent modes are temporarily overridden for display purposes, which is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets or insecure practices detected. Overall, the code functions as intended for scheduling management without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard scheduling orchestration module with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or significant security risks. It mainly coordinates existing components to perform scheduling tasks securely and transparently.",
