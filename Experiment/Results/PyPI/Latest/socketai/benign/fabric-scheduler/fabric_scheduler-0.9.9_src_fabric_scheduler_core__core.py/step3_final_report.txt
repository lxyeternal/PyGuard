{
  "purpose": "This code provides a scheduling interface for Fabric artifacts, managing workspace, artifacts, and schedules via a REST API.",
  "sources": "Reads input from CSV files or strings, and interacts with external fabric.FabricRestClient() for network operations.",
  "sinks": "API calls to fabric.FabricRestClient() and internal methods that process artifacts and schedules.",
  "flows": "Input sources (CSV or artifacts list) flow into set_artifacts_to_schedule; API interactions occur during schedule creation, display, and deletion.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward orchestrator for scheduling Fabric artifacts, utilizing external SDKs and internal managers. It performs input validation, manages internal state securely, and interacts with the network via standard API calls. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. The structure and logic are clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious activity. The use of external SDKs appears legitimate, and the code's purpose is well-defined. No vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured scheduling interface for Fabric artifacts with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with its function as an API wrapper. It is safe for use in production environments.",
