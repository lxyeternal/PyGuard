{
  "purpose": "The code implements a scheduling module for Fabric artifacts, enabling loading, displaying, deleting, and creating schedules within a workspace environment.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to methods (csv_source, artifacts, scope), internal method calls, and the fabric.FabricRestClient() instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Calls to fabric.FabricRestClient() which may communicate with external REST API endpoints; printing to console for user notifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs (csv_source, artifacts, scope) through method calls, potentially interacting with external REST API via fabric.FabricRestClient, and outputs (prints or API calls).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The use of fabric.FabricRestClient() appears standard for API communication.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a wrapper around Fabric REST API interactions, managing artifacts and schedules with standard validation and user notifications. No signs of malicious data handling or suspicious behaviors. There are no hardcoded secrets or backdoors; the REST client usage is typical. The print statements for warnings are benign and serve user interaction. No external data exfiltration, malicious code execution, or covert channels are evident. Overall, the code appears legitimate and focused on its scheduling functions.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a legitimate scheduling module with no apparent malicious behavior. It uses standard API calls and user notifications without any suspicious activity or security concerns.",
