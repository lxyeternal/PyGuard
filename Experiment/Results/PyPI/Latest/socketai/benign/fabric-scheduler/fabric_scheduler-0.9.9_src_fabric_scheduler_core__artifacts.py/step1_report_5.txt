{
  "purpose": "Manage artifact processing, matching, validation, and scheduling for fabric artifacts, including CSV parsing and artifact lookup.",
  "sources": "Input data: CSV files or strings, CSV content, in-memory lists, environment variables (indirectly through imported modules), and CSV rows for schedule configuration.",
  "sinks": "Display functions (display_artifacts_as_table), exception messages, and data merging functions.",
  "flows": "Input is parsed from CSV or list; data is validated and populated; artifacts are matched against workspace artifacts; final artifacts are returned and displayed.",
  "anomalies": "No evidence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Use of parsing and matching appears standard; no suspicious external network calls or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code thoroughly handles CSV parsing with validation, constructs artifact data structures, and matches them with workspace artifacts without executing external commands or network calls. It employs standard validation and data handling practices. No indicators of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data leaks, or reverse shells, are present. The use of imported utility functions like 'read_csv_content' and 'display_artifacts_as_table' appears legitimate. No obfuscation or suspicious control flow is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a secure artifact management module with standard parsing, validation, and matching logic. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware is evident. The only concern could be if the imported utility functions are malicious, but they are standard utility modules assumed safe. Overall, the code is secure.",
