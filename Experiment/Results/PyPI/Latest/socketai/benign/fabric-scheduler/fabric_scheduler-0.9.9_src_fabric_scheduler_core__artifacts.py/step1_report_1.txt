{
  "purpose": "Manage artifact scheduling, matching, validation, and CSV processing within a larger artifact management system.",
  "sources": "Input data from CSV files or strings, and artifact data from function parameters.",
  "sinks": "None directly involve untrusted data sinks that could leak information or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "CSV input (source) -> parsing functions -> artifact creation and validation -> matched with workspace artifacts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data handling observed. Use of standard library functions and controlled CSV parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs CSV parsing, data validation, and matching artifacts with workspace entries. It uses well-defined functions for parsing CSV content, validates required columns, and merges properties based on matches. No data is sent over networks or accessed insecurely. Functions handle input validation and error raising but do not process untrusted data in a way that could lead to code injection or data leaks. The code does not include any obfuscated or dynamic execution features. The only potentially risky operation is reading CSV files and parsing data, which is managed by external utility functions that appear to be standard. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard artifact management module with safe parsing and matching logic. No malicious or suspicious activity is identified. The overall security risk is low, with no evidence of malware or harmful behavior.",
