{
  "purpose": "Artifact management, CSV parsing, matching, validation, and display within a scheduling context.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters (list, CSV file path, CSV content), external utility functions for CSV reading and validation, and data fields within CSV rows.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, system modifications, or data leaks are present. The code processes data internally and displays tables.",
  "flows": "Input data is parsed via utility functions, transformed into artifact dictionaries, validated and populated with defaults, then matched against workspace artifacts, and finally displayed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. External utility functions are assumed safe.",
  "analysis": "The code performs routine CSV parsing, data validation, artifact matching, and display. It uses external utilities for CSV handling, which are presumed safe. No network activity, code injection, or malicious data handling is evident. Validation and default population are standard. The matching logic is straightforward, with exception handling for unmatched artifacts. Overall, the code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard artifact management module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
