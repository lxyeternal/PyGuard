{
  "purpose": "The code manages schedule validation, API interactions for schedule creation, retrieval, deletion, and display within a scheduling system.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from schedule configuration dictionaries, artifact data, and API responses.",
  "sinks": "API requests to create, delete, or fetch schedules; print statements for logging and error reporting.",
  "flows": "Source data (configurations, artifacts) flows into validation functions and API request bodies; responses are processed and displayed; delete/create functions invoke API endpoints with constructed URLs and payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. Error handling via print statements is standard for CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard schedule validation, API interactions, and display routines. Validation functions check for valid types, date/time formats, and ranges. API URLs are constructed dynamically from artifact data. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks. Error handling is broad but typical. The API endpoints and request bodies follow standard REST patterns. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious data flows are present. The overall structure is straightforward and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured schedule management component with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk. The existing assessments are accurate and justified.",
