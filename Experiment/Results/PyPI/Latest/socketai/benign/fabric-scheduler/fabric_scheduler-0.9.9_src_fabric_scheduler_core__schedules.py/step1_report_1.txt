{
  "purpose": "This module manages schedule validation, retrieval, display, creation, and deletion for artifacts in a system, providing API interactions and validation logic.",
  "sources": "Reads schedule configurations from artifact data structures, user inputs (indirectly via function parameters), API responses from make_api_request.",
  "sinks": "API requests to create, delete, or retrieve schedules; print statements for user feedback; data transformation functions for display.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to API requests via schedule configuration extraction; schedule data retrieved from API and stored in artifacts; display functions process data for user viewing; delete and create functions modify schedules via API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no use of obfuscated code or dynamic execution; API URLs constructed from parameters appear standard; no suspicious data flows or unexpected code behaviors; exception handling is present but generic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard schedule validation, API interactions for managing schedules, and display formatting. Validation functions check schedule types and fields, avoiding insecure or suspicious patterns. The API request functions build URLs and request bodies using data from artifact structures, with no evidence of malicious payloads or obfuscated code. Error handling is broad, but no signs of data exfiltration or backdoors are present. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious domain names, or malicious data leaks are visible. The use of print statements for error reporting is typical for CLI tools and not suspicious. Overall, the code appears to perform legitimate scheduling management functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of schedule management with validation, API interactions, and display logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It appears to be a legitimate component of a larger system, with standard security practices and no evident supply chain threats.",
