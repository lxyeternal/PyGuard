  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code with the claims, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward CSV utility module: reading CSV data from strings, files, or notebook resources; validating required columns; converting DataFrames to dictionaries.\n- No dynamic code execution, network communication, or obfuscated logic.\n- The fallback to `notebookutils` is environment-specific but not malicious.\n- Exception handling is standard.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:**  \nBenign, standard CSV utilities, no malware, no obfuscation, low security risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (low, due to general CSV handling risks)\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code. The low risk score is reasonable, given the potential for CSV injection if used improperly, but that's a known CSV concern, not malicious code.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:**  \nStandard CSV handling, mentions potential CSV payloads like formula injection but clarifies these are known risks, not malicious code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (slightly higher, acknowledging CSV injection risks)\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe mention of formula injection as a CSV security concern is valid, but the code itself does not perform or facilitate such attacks; it's just CSV processing. The fallback to `notebookutils` is environment-dependent but not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:**  \nBenign, standard CSV utilities, no suspicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies the code as standard and safe.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:**  \nStandard CSV handling, no malicious behavior, proper validation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 (or very close)\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:**  \nAgain, standard CSV utilities, no malicious intent, environment-specific utility.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (slightly above zero, considering environment and potential CSV risks)\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe low risk score seems reasonable, considering the minimal attack surface.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a set of standard CSV utility functions with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The scores across reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0.\n- The risk score could be slightly above zero due to inherent CSV risks (like formula injection), but these are general CSV concerns, not specific vulnerabilities or malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (to reflect general CSV handling risks, but not malicious)\n\n**Justification:**  \n- No malicious code, backdoors, or malware detected.  \n- No obfuscation present.  \n- The only concern is inherent CSV security issues (e.g., formula injection), which are well-known and not specific to this code.  \n- The code does not perform any network, system modification, or dynamic code execution.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's benign nature. The overall security posture of this code is very low risk, with no malware or obfuscation.",
