{
  "purpose": "Provides utilities for reading, validating, and converting CSV data, mainly for use in data processing workflows within the Fabric Scheduler.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as csv_content, file_path, file_name, and external modules like notebookutils (conditional import).",
  "sinks": "The code reads CSV data from potentially untrusted sources, but it does not explicitly write or send data elsewhere. No sinks that could leak data or execute harmful actions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (csv_content, file_path, file_name) through pandas.read_csv functions, with validation steps checking for missing columns or empty data, and conversion to dicts.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard data handling patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides CSV reading and validation utilities. It uses pandas to parse CSV data from strings, file paths, or notebook resource directories. The conditional import of 'notebookutils' to locate resources is a controlled fallback mechanism. Error handling is performed through try-except blocks that raise ValueError with descriptive messages, but no malicious or suspicious behavior is observed. No code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoor mechanisms are present. The code solely focuses on safe data processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard utility module for handling CSV data with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical data validation and conversion tasks without exposing or transmitting sensitive information, and no malicious patterns are detected.",
