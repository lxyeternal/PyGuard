{
  "purpose": "Provides utilities for reading, validating, and converting CSV data within the Fabric Scheduler context.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as csv_content (string or file-like object), file_path, and file_name; external modules like pandas and notebookutils.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly designed as sinks; functions process data without untrusted data outputting to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are read by pandas functions (pd.read_csv), and data is validated and converted internally without external data flows that could be exploited.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Fall-back to reading files from notebookutils or local path is standard. Exception handling is straightforward and limited to error reporting.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads CSV data from various sources, validates column presence, and converts DataFrames to dictionaries. The use of pandas.read_csv is common and safe when handling local files or strings. The fallback to notebookutils.nbResPath appears standard for notebook environments. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present. No suspicious network activity, system modifications, or hidden behaviors are detected. The code's structure is clear and consistent, with proper exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical CSV utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles input validation and file reading securely, with no indication of sabotage or malware.",
