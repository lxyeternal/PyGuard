  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Benign CSV utility functions; no malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The functions are standard, with no suspicious behavior. The fallback to `notebookutils` is environment-specific but not malicious.\n- **Verdict:** The low risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Standard CSV handling; potential CSV content risks like formula injection are acknowledged but are general CSV concerns, not code issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** No malicious code detected; the mention of CSV injection is a known CSV risk, not malware.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Routine CSV reading and validation; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward and safe.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to above; standard data handling with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Routine CSV utilities; no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The code is typical, with minor risk from CSV content, but nothing malicious.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malware.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is accurate given the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly low (0.1–0.2), reflecting general CSV handling risks, not specific vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a set of standard CSV utility functions, with proper error handling and environment-aware fallback mechanisms.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent are present.\n- The scores assigned across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (standard CSV processing risks, no specific vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. The low risk scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
