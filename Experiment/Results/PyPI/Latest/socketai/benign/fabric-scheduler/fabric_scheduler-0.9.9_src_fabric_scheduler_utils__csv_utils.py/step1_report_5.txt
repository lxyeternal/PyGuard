  "sources": "Input parameters such as csv_content, file_path, file_name, and internal import statements.",
  "sinks": "pd.read_csv() functions, which read data from files or strings, and the return of DataFrame objects.",
  "flows": "Input strings or file-like objects flow into pd.read_csv(), with validation and fallback mechanisms in place.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Use of standard libraries and typical CSV handling functions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard CSV utilities: checking file path extensions, reading CSV from strings, files, or notebook resources, validating columns, and converting DataFrames to dictionaries. It includes error handling and fallback logic for notebook utilities. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious data handling observed. The import of 'notebookutils' appears to be a context-specific utility for notebook environments, not malicious. No signs of obfuscated code or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for CSV data handling with no malicious intent. It implements common patterns for reading and validating CSV data, with proper error handling and fallback options. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware in this code.",
