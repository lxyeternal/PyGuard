{
  "purpose": "Provide CSV utility functions for reading, validating, and converting CSV data, mainly for use within Fabric Scheduler workflows.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as CSV content strings, file paths, and notebook resource names; reading functions accessing the filesystem or external notebook resources.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that send data elsewhere; functions mainly process CSV data locally. The only external interaction is file reading and optional notebook resource access.",
  "flows": "Input data (strings or file paths) flows into pandas read functions; validation functions check DataFrame columns; conversion functions process data into dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The fallback to notebookutils for resource path reading is standard but could be scrutinized, though it does not pose a malicious risk.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard CSV handling routines with typical error handling. It reads CSV data from strings, files, or notebook resources, performs validation of required columns, and converts DataFrames to dictionaries. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or network communication is present. The fallback to optional notebookutils module is safe and common in notebook environments. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The module appears to be a benign set of CSV utility functions intended for local data processing within the Fabric Scheduler project. There is no evidence of malware, malicious code, or security risks in this code segment.",
