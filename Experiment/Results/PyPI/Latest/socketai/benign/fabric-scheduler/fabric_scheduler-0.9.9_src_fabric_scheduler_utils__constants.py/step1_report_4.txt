  "purpose": "Define constants for the fabric_scheduler package, including schedule settings, valid types, and job mappings.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions and variable assignments, including string literals and set/dictionary initializations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; all variables are static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior. The constants are straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines static constants, including default time zone, schedule times, maximum interval, valid schedule types and weekdays, and a mapping for job types. There are no user inputs, external data reads, or dynamic executions. No indication of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The constants are benign and intended for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a simple, benign configuration/constants file with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code, and its purpose is purely to define static values for other components.",
