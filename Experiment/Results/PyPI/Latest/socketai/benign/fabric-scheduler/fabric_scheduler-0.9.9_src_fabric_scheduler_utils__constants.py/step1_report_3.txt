  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration settings used throughout the fabric_scheduler package, including schedule times, types, and job mappings.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data output, network operations, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code consists solely of constant definitions and static data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or unusual code behaviors are present. All constants and data structures are straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration module that defines constants and static sets/dictionaries for use in scheduling logic. There are no functions, no data handling, and no dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, no input/output operations, and no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The constants are standard, and the code appears intended solely for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module containing only constant definitions, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is safe and contains no signs of malware or security concerns.",
