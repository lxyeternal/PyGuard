  "purpose": "Define constants for the Fabric Scheduler package, including schedule settings, valid types, and job mappings.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions, string literals, and set/dictionary initializations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; no external input or data output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only initializes constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and purely declares constants with no dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of constants related to scheduling parameters, valid values, and job types. All data are static literals assigned to variables. No user input, network operations, file I/O, or execution of dynamic code occurs. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The purpose is configuration setup, and it appears benign. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration module defining constants for scheduling parameters and types. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and intended for standard use within the package.",
