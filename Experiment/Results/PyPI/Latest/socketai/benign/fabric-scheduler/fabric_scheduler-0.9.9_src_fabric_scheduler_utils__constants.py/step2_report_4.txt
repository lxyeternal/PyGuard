  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the code to determine the accuracy of their assessments and scores.\n\n**Overall code review:**\n\n- The code consists solely of static constant definitions: string literals, sets, and dictionaries.\n- No dynamic code, input/output, external data sources, or executable logic.\n- No obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or suspicious patterns.\n- The purpose is purely configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, static, and benign. There are no vulnerabilities, malware, or malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Summary:** The code is a harmless collection of constants, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n  These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Summary:** Same as above; constants with no external data or dynamic code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n  Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Summary:** Static constants for configuration, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n  Correct.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Summary:** Static constants, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n  Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Summary:** Simple constants, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n  Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- The security risk score is 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a static configuration module with no security concerns.\n- The scores assigned by all reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a simple, static constants module with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no further action is needed.",
