  "purpose": "Define constants for the fabric_scheduler package, including schedule settings and valid value sets.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points, nor untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code only declares static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines constants and static collections with no external data input, no dynamic code execution, no sensitive information, or malicious logic. There are no obfuscated elements or behaviors indicative of malicious intent. The structure and content suggest it's purely configuration data without any security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a harmless collection of constants used for scheduling configurations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
