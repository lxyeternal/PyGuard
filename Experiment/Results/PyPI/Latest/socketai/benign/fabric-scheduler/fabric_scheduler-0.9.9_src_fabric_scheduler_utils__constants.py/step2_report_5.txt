  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\n\n- The code is a static constants module for scheduling configurations, with no dynamic logic, input/output, or external data handling.\n- All data are hardcoded string literals, sets, and dictionaries.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The purpose is purely to define constants used elsewhere in the application.\n\n**Specific observations:**\n\n- The constants like `DEFAULT_TIMEZONE`, `DEFAULT_START_TIME`, and `DEFAULT_END_TIME` are straightforward.\n- The `MAX_INTERVAL` value (5270400 minutes) equals exactly 10 years, which is a reasonable upper limit for scheduling intervals.\n- The sets `VALID_SCHEDULE_TYPES` and `VALID_WEEKDAYS`, and the dictionary `JOB_TYPES`, are standard and contain no suspicious entries.\n- The code contains no functions, no external data sources, no dynamic code, and no secrets.\n\n**Review of the reports:**\n\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- They uniformly assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0.\n- Their confidence levels are all 1, which is appropriate given the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n- The analysis is consistent across reports.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- The security risk score is 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or sensitive data.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n\n- No issues found; all reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is purely configuration data, so high risk scores would be unjustified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a safe, static configuration module with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Confirmed no issues present.  \n- No errors or flaws in reasoning.  \n- Scores are reasonable and justified.  \n- No further action needed.",
