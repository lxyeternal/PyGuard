{
  "purpose": "Defines constants for scheduling configurations such as time zones, start/end times, valid schedule types, weekdays, and job mappings.",
  "sources": "Static constant definitions; no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static constants without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static configuration with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, defining constants related to scheduling parameters, time zones, valid types, and job mappings. There are no functions, dynamic code, external data sources, or executable logic. The constants are simple string literals, sets, and dictionaries, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the static, configuration-only nature of the code. The scores are consistent and justified, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static configuration module with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
