  "purpose": "Define constants for the fabric_scheduler package related to scheduling configurations and valid values.",
  "sources": "None; all data are hardcoded string, set, or dictionary constants.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; constants are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, or hidden functionality. The code only defines constants and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares constant values, including strings, sets, and dictionaries used for schedule configurations. No user input, network communication, or dynamic execution is present. All data are static and predefined, with no logic or control flow that could be exploited or malicious. The comments and variable names clearly indicate intended usage. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward constants definition module with no malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscated code. It solely provides configuration constants for scheduling purposes.",
