  "purpose": "Package initializer handling version detection and import setup for the Fabric Scheduler package.",
  "sources": "Reading __name__ for package name, importing version info, and importing ArtifactScheduler from local core module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "Version info retrieved from package metadata; ArtifactScheduler imported from local module.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __name__ as package name for version retrieval; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package initialization tasks: handling Python version compatibility, retrieving package version, and importing core classes. No security flaws, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are evident. The use of __name__ for version retrieval is typical, and exception handling is appropriate. The code is straightforward and well-structured, with no suspicious patterns or external data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, secure package initializer with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The reports lack detail and show 'Empty response' errors, indicating no concrete issues are identified. Based on the code, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is very low (~0.1). The package appears safe and well-structured.",
