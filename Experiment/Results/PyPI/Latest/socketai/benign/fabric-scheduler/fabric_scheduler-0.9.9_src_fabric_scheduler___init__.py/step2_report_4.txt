  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code**\n\nAll reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response provided. Since no specific details are given, I cannot verify any issues directly from the reports. The code appears straightforward, and there are no apparent vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors in the snippet provided.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and record errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary**\n\n- The reports lack content; they do not specify what the supposed issue is. Without details, it's impossible to validate or invalidate the claims.\n- The \"error\" field states \"Empty response,\" which suggests the reports are incomplete or improperly generated.\n- Since no specific problem is described, I cannot find flaws or mistakes in the reports' reasoning.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores given to each issue and suggest any changes**\n\n- No scores are provided in the reports, only \"error\" messages.\n- Given the lack of information, assigning any risk or malware scores would be arbitrary.\n- If the reports had scores, I would assess whether they are reasonable based on the code.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any risk score higher than 0.5**\n\n- The code is a typical package setup with version detection and import statements.\n- There are no indications of security flaws, malicious code, or vulnerabilities.\n- Therefore, unless malicious intent or vulnerabilities are explicitly demonstrated, risk scores should be low, likely near 0.\n\n**Step 5: Pay attention to the malware score**\n\n- The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or dynamic code execution.\n- No malicious behavior is evident.\n- Malware score should be 0.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge claims based on assumptions**\n\n- Since the reports contain no detailed claims, I cannot challenge any assumptions.\n- The absence of detailed issues suggests that the code is relatively safe and standard.\n\n**Step 7: Check for consistency between scores and report content**\n\n- No scores are provided, but based on the code, the risk and malware scores should be minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Code security evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is straightforward and not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard package setup, no vulnerabilities)\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- The reports are incomplete; no specific issues are identified or substantiated.\n- Without concrete evidence or detailed descriptions, there's no basis for higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nBased on the code and the reports:\n\n- The code appears secure and standard.\n- The reports lack content; no issues can be confirmed.\n- The scores should reflect minimal risk and malware potential.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Conclusion:** The package is safe based on the provided code and the incomplete reports.",
