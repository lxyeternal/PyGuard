  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports systematically.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if reported issues are present in the code**\n\nAll reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no additional details. Since no specific issues are provided, I cannot verify particular vulnerabilities or flaws from the reports themselves. The absence of detailed responses suggests either a failure in report generation or missing information.\n\n**Step 2: Review the code for potential issues**\n\n- **Version Compatibility Handling:**  \n  The code correctly checks Python version and imports `importlib.metadata` or `importlib_metadata` accordingly.  \n  **Potential concern:** The variable `dist_name` is set to `__name__`, which in a package module would be `'fabric_scheduler'` or similar.  \n  **Issue:** The `version()` function is called with `dist_name`, which is set to `__name__`. If the module is not installed as a package, `version(dist_name)` will raise `PackageNotFoundError`, which is handled gracefully by setting `__version__` to `\"unknown\"`.\n\n- **Exception Handling:**  \n  The `try-except` block is appropriate, and the `finally` block deletes imported symbols, which is good practice to clean namespace.\n\n- **Import of `ArtifactScheduler`:**  \n  The import path `.core._core` suggests that the core implementation resides in `core/_core.py`.  \n  **Potential concern:** If this module is malicious or compromised, importing it could be dangerous. But there's no evidence here.\n\n- **Security implications:**  \n  The code itself appears straightforward, with no obvious malicious code or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores and their reasonableness**\n\nSince no scores are provided, I will assume the typical scoring approach:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  The code does not contain any malicious behavior (e.g., code injection, network calls, obfuscated code).  \n  **Expected score:** 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is clear and straightforward.  \n  **Expected score:** 0.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Given the simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities, the overall risk is low.  \n  **Expected score:** 0 or very close to it.\n\n**Step 4: Justify higher scores if assigned**\n\n- No justification for higher scores exists here because the code is transparent and does not perform any suspicious actions.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge any assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- The only potential concern could be the dynamic import of `ArtifactScheduler` from a possibly compromised module.  \n- However, without evidence of malicious code or malicious behavior, this remains an assumption.  \n- The import path appears standard for a package structure.\n\n**Step 6: Consistency of scores with report**\n\n- The reports lack details, so I cannot verify if the reported issues are valid or not.  \n- Based on the code review, no issues are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** (code is clear and straightforward)  \n**Risk score:** **0** (low risk based on current code)\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- If the reports are incomplete or incorrectly generated, further information is needed to assess potential issues.\n- The package seems well-structured and does not exhibit any security flaws or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears secure, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The scores should reflect minimal risk, malware, and obfuscation concerns.",
