  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n### 1. Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code\n- All reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response data provided.\n- Without additional details, there's no explicit indication of issues like vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or flaws in the code.\n- Based solely on the code snippet, no errors, flaws, or malicious activity are evident.\n\n### 2. Identify and record errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary\n- The reports lack substantive information; they don't specify what the problem is.\n- An \"Empty response\" report without context makes it impossible to verify or analyze the claimed issues.\n- This suggests either an incomplete report or a failure to capture relevant data.\n\n### 3. Review the scores given to each issue and suggest changes\n- Since no issues are described, any assigned scores (if any) are unjustified.\n- If the reports assigned any risk or malware scores, they should be reconsidered as unsubstantiated.\n\n### 4. Justify any risk score higher than 0.5\n- No evidence of vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or security flaws is present.\n- Therefore, risk scores should be low or zero unless further information indicates otherwise.\n\n### 5. Pay attention to malware score\n- No indication of malicious behavior (e.g., malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation) is present.\n- The code appears straightforward and well-structured, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n### 6. Challenge any claims based on assumptions\n- Without concrete evidence, claims about vulnerabilities or malware are purely speculative.\n- The reports should include specific findings before assigning high scores.\n\n### 7. Ensure consistency of scores with the report\n- Given the lack of detailed information, any high scores are unwarranted.\n- The scores should reflect the absence of issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Code review:**\n- The code is a typical package initializer, handling versioning and imports.\n- No security issues, malicious activity, or obfuscation are evident.\n- The use of `importlib.metadata` and fallback to `importlib_metadata` is standard for compatibility.\n- The code is clean and straightforward.\n\n**Risk, malware, obfuscated scores:**\n- **Risk score:** Should be very low (close to 0), as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities.\n- **Malware score:** Should be 0, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be 0, the code is clear and readable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nBased on the provided code and the reports lacking detail, **the package appears secure and free of malicious intent**. The reports do not provide any concrete evidence to justify higher scores.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just acknowledging the lack of detailed info)\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If additional context or detailed reports become available, these scores should be revisited accordingly.",
