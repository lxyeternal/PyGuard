  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully:\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code\n- The reports contain only \"Empty response\" errors with no detailed raw responses or explanations.\n- Therefore, there is no concrete evidence or detailed description of issues in the code from these reports.\n- **Conclusion:** No specific issues are confirmed based on the provided reports.\n\n### Step 2: Review the code for potential issues, errors, or flaws\n- The code appears to be a standard package initialization script with version handling:\n  - Correctly handles Python versions >= 3.8 and below.\n  - Uses `importlib.metadata` or `importlib_metadata` accordingly.\n  - Attempts to retrieve the package version and handles `PackageNotFoundError`.\n  - Cleans up imported symbols afterward.\n  - Imports a core class and exposes it via `__all__`.\n- **No obvious security flaws or malicious behavior** are evident.\n- The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package setup.\n\n### Step 3: Review the scores assigned to issues\n- Since no issues are identified, no scores should be assigned.\n- If scores were assigned (not shown here), they should be minimal or zero.\n\n### Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5\n- No issues or vulnerabilities are identified, so a high risk score is unjustified.\n- The code does not perform any network operations, data handling, or other risky activities.\n\n### Step 5: Review malware score\n- The code does not contain any malicious behavior.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- Malware score should be zero.\n\n### Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities\n- Since the reports lack details, any assumptions about vulnerabilities are unfounded.\n- The code seems safe and standard.\n\n### Step 7: Consistency of scores with the report\n- No issues, no scores should be assigned.\n\n---\n\n## Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no risks identified)\n\n---\n\n## Additional notes:\n- The reports are incomplete or uninformative; they do not provide actionable details.\n- Without concrete evidence, no changes to scores or further analysis is justified.\n\n**Summary:** The code appears secure, well-structured, and free of issues based on the available information. The reports do not indicate any vulnerabilities or malicious activity.",
