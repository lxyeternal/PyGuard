{
  "purpose": "Manage workspace-related operations including initialization and artifact retrieval for Fabric.",
  "sources": "Reads workspace ID, workspace name, and artifacts data from API responses and user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Outputs print statements and DataFrame display; no direct sinks for untrusted data manipulation or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input workspace ID → API call to resolve name and fetch artifacts → processes data and outputs information.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. Uses external API and display functions responsibly.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes and manages workspaces through API calls, handles JSON responses securely, and outputs information for user visibility. No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. Functions are straightforward, with proper exception handling and validation. No obfuscated code or malicious flow detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign workspace management module that interacts with external APIs to fetch and display artifacts. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident. It operates within expected bounds for such functionality.",
