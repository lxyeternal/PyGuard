{
  "purpose": "The code manages workspace operations, including initialization, name resolution, and artifact retrieval within a fabric workspace environment.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function parameters (workspace_id), API responses from fabric.get_workspace_id() and client.get(), and API responses from make_api_request().",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing error messages and workspace info, returning artifacts, and displaying dataframes using get_display_function() and print_if_not_silent().",
  "flows": "Input workspace_id flows through _initialize_workspace() and _resolve_workspace_name(), API responses from client.get() and make_api_request() are processed, and artifacts are fetched, validated, and optionally displayed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious strings, or unusual code structures detected. Error handling is standard, with exception catching and printing messages.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API interactions, data validation, and display operations. It uses external API calls to fetch workspace and artifact data, with error handling via try-except blocks. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or unusual data exfiltration mechanisms. No obfuscated or suspicious code features are present. Display functions are used for normal output, and data validation ensures data integrity. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate workspace management logic without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements typical workspace management functions with proper data validation and error handling. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code relies on external APIs and display utilities for standard operations, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
