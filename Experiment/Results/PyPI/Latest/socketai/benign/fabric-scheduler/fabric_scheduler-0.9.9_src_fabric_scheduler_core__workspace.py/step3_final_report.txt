  "sinks": "Display functions outputting data, print statements for errors.",
  "flows": "API response -> validation and extraction -> display/output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API interactions with proper validation and error handling. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. External utilities are used in a typical manner. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical workspace management modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and secure. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or high security risk are present. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
