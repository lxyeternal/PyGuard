{
  "purpose": "Manage workspace operations such as initialization and artifact retrieval from the Fabric platform.",
  "sources": "API calls to endpoints like /v1/workspaces/{workspace_id} and /v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/items; reading JSON responses from these API calls.",
  "sinks": "Printing to console, displaying dataframes, and raising exceptions; no direct data leaks or untrusted data effects identified.",
  "flows": "API response data is fetched and processed; data is used for display or returned as artifacts; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks like system commands or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. Use of try-except for error handling is standard. No hardcoded credentials or secret keys are present. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages API interactions to fetch workspace and artifact data, with proper validation of response fields. Error handling is standard, and there are no indications of malicious code or backdoors. All external data flows are limited to API requests and console outputs, with no evident malicious intent. The use of external utility functions appears standard and safe. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a workspace management module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs API requests, processes responses, and displays information without involving unsafe operations or hidden malicious logic.",
