No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is evident. The minor security concern related to path modification and command execution is typical for such scripts and does not indicate malicious intent."

The reports lack detail and show 'Empty response' errors, indicating no concrete issues are identified. Based on the code, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is very low (~0.1). The package appears safe and well-structured."

No adjustments are necessary; the code can be considered safe and benign."
