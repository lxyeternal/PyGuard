{
  "purpose": "To configure the setup process for the Python package 'fabric_scheduler' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports the 'setup' function from 'setuptools' and executes 'setup' with specific arguments.",
  "sinks": "The 'setup' function could potentially install or modify system files during package installation, but there are no direct untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: if the script is run, it calls 'setup' with predefined parameters. Error handling involves printing messages but does not affect system security.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious logic. The try-except block is standard for handling build errors. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration file generated by PyScaffold. It attempts to run 'setup' with a specific version scheme. In case of errors, it provides guidance on updating build tools. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or any malicious activity. It’s a standard, safe setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup script for packaging, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply facilitates package installation with error handling. There is no malware or suspicious activity detected.",
