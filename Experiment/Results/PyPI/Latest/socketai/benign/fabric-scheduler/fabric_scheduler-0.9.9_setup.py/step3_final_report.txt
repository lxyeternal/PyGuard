{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the Python package 'fabric_scheduler' generated by PyScaffold.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and uses it directly.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects; the script performs package setup only.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script executes setup with a fixed configuration, no dynamic or external data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, generated by a known tool, with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script that imports 'setuptools.setup' and calls it with a version scheme. It uses a broad try-except block to handle errors, which is common in setup scripts but not suspicious. No external inputs, network activity, or code obfuscation are present. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code does not contain any malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The exception handling, while broad, does not pose a security threat. The overall assessment is that the script is safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
