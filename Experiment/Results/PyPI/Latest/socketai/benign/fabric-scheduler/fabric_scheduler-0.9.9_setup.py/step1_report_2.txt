{
  "purpose": "To configure the setup process for the 'fabric_scheduler' Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it primarily imports and executes setup functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not execute untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The script calls the setup function; if an error occurs, it prints a message and raises an exception. No external data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The exception handling is broad but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py file generated by PyScaffold. It imports setuptools and executes the setup() function with a specific version scheme. Error handling is broad, only printing a message and re-raising exceptions. No external data sources, untrusted inputs, or suspicious code patterns are detected. There is no indication of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical project setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely facilitates package installation and management.",
