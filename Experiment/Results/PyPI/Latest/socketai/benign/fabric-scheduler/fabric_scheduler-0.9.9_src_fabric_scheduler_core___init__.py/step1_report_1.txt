  "purpose": "Provides core functionality and business logic classes for Fabric Scheduler, including artifact, schedule, and workspace management.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: _artifacts, _core, _schedules, _workspace",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks or external data handling present in this code snippet",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code structures; only import statements and __all__ declaration",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific classes from internal modules and defines an __all__ list for export. No dynamic execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears to serve as a module's main interface, with no suspicious or malicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a straightforward module aggregator, exposing core classes for a scheduler system. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this snippet.",
