  "purpose": "Core functionality for Fabric Scheduler, containing business logic classes related to artifacts, schedules, and workspace management.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_artifacts, _core, _schedules, _workspace)",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks is evident; the code only imports classes and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several classes from internal modules and exposes them via __all__, serving as an aggregator module. No dynamic execution, user input handling, network communication, or credential management is present. The code appears to be a straightforward package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard package aggregator and contains no malicious behavior or security concerns based on the provided snippet. It simply re-exports classes from internal modules for external use.",
