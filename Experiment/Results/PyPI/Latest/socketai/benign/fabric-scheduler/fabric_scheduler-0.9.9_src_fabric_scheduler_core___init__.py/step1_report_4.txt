  "purpose": "Defines core classes and modules for Fabric Scheduler's business logic, facilitating artifact and schedule management.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._artifacts, ._core, ._schedules, ._workspace.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external effects; no network, file, or environment interactions.",
  "flows": "Imports serve as sources; no data flows to sinks or external systems are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward module aggregation with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from internal modules and exposes them via __all__. It functions solely as an index or aggregator of core components. There are no input handling, environment variables, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present. The simplicity reduces the likelihood of malicious behavior within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module aggregator with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It merely exposes core classes for use elsewhere, with no evident security risks.",
