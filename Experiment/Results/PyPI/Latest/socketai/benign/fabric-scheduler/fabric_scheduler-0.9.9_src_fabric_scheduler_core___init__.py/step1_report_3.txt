{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an initialization or module entry point, importing core classes related to artifact management, scheduling, and workspace handling for a Fabric Scheduler system.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: ._artifacts, ._core, ._schedules, and ._workspace.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no network operations, file writes, or environment variable uses are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports classes and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code appears straightforward and standard for module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes from internal modules and defines the __all__ list for export. There are no input handling, network operations, dynamic code execution, or other suspicious activities. The structure is typical for Python package modules, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initializer for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports and exposes core classes for a Fabric Scheduler package.",
