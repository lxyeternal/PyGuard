{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an aggregator or index for core classes related to Fabric Scheduler, importing internal components and exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from internal module imports (_artifacts, _core, _schedules, _workspace).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code contains only static import statements and a symbol list.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes from internal modules and exposes them via __all__, with no runtime data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports specific classes and defines an __all__ list for exports. It contains no dynamic code, network operations, or data processing. All reports correctly identify it as a benign, standard module aggregator. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is minimal (0 or 0.1). The high confidence scores are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present or inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module initializer/aggregator with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the malware score should remain 0, obfuscated 0, and risk at most 0.1. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
