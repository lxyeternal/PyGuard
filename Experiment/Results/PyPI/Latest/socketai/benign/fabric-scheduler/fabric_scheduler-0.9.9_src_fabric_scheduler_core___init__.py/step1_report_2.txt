{
  "purpose": "Provides core functionality for a Fabric Scheduler, defining and exporting key business logic classes related to artifacts, schedules, and workspace management.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: ._artifacts, ._core, ._schedules, ._workspace",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no network, file, or environment variable interactions observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks identified; the code mainly imports and re-exports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code is straightforward and only manages imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several classes from internal modules related to artifact management, scheduling, and workspace handling, then exposes them via __all__ for external use. There are no data inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code is minimal, clean, and appears to serve as an entry point or package interface. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected. The code’s simplicity and lack of side effects suggest it’s a standard module definition file.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a module initializer and exporter for core scheduling classes. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, with no evidence of data leakage, backdoors, or malware. It appears to be a standard, benign package component.",
