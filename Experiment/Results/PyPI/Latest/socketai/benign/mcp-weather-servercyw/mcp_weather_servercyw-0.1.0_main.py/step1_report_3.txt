{
  "purpose": "The code provides a weather query service that fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API and formats it for display.",
  "sources": "API_KEY input via command-line argument, HTTP response data from OpenWeather API",
  "sinks": "None directly. The API_KEY is stored in a global variable for API requests; HTTP responses are parsed but not stored or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "API_KEY is set through command-line arguments, used in fetch_weather to authorize API requests, response data is parsed and formatted for output.",
  "anomalies": "API_KEY is passed as a command-line argument, which is standard; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns; no obfuscated code present; no suspicious data exfiltration or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an MCP server and defines functions for fetching and formatting weather data from OpenWeather API. The API key is provided at runtime, which reduces risk of hardcoded secrets. HTTP requests are made asynchronously with proper error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands. The code structure is clear and standard for such an application.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward weather querying service with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It correctly handles API key input, performs external requests, and formats responses without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
