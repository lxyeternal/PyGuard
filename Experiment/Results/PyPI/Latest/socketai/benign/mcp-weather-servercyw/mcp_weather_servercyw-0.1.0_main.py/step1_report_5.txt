{
  "purpose": "This code implements a weather query server that fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API and formats the results for user queries.",
  "sources": "The code reads the API key from command-line arguments and user input (city name). It also reads data from the HTTP response from the weather API.",
  "sinks": "The data retrieved from the weather API and the formatted weather report are returned to the caller. The code does not write data to external systems, but the API key and user input could be misused if mishandled.",
  "flows": "User provides city name input -> fetch_weather() constructs API request with API_KEY and city -> HTTP response processed -> format_weather() formats the data for output -> output returned to user.",
  "anomalies": "API_KEY is set via command-line argument, which is standard; no hardcoded credentials. No evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely fetches weather data using async HTTP requests. API_KEY is provided at runtime via arguments, minimizing hardcoded secrets. The response handling is straightforward, with error handling for HTTP errors and exceptions. The data formatting is benign. No signs of malicious behavior or malware, such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or backdoors, are present. The use of external libraries (httpx) and the server setup via mcp appears to be legitimate and standard. Overall, the code is a typical API client with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward weather API client server with proper input handling and no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It appears safe and purposeful.",
