  "purpose": "Fetches weather data from OpenWeather API for a specified city and formats the information for display.",
  "sources": "User input for city name, API key provided via command-line argument, HTTP request to OpenWeather API.",
  "sinks": "Response data from OpenWeather API, formatted weather information returned to user.",
  "flows": "User inputs city name -> fetch_weather uses city and API_KEY to request data -> response processed by format_weather -> formatted string returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward with proper handling of API key and errors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard weather API client that retrieves and formats weather data. It handles API keys securely via runtime input, uses standard libraries, and includes error handling. No suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The data flow is simple and transparent, with no signs of data exfiltration or backdoors. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1), consistent with a benign API client. The code's structure and behavior do not indicate any malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. It functions as a straightforward weather data fetcher. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and align with the analysis.",
