  "conclusion": "The code snippet appears benign but uses a wildcard import, which can hide malicious code if present in threads_post. The actual risk depends on the imported module's content. Scores are appropriately low, with a cautious risk score to reflect potential concerns. Further inspection of threads_post is recommended to fully assess security."
