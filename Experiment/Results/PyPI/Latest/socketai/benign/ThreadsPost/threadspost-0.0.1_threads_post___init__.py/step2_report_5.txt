  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .threads_post import *\n\n__version__ = '0.0.1'\n```\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is minimal, consisting solely of a wildcard import from a local module and a version string assignment.\n- Wildcard imports (`from module import *`) are discouraged because they obscure what is imported and can hide malicious or unintended code.\n- Without inspecting the contents of `threads_post`, we cannot definitively determine if malicious code exists within it.\n- No network activity, data leaks, obfuscated code, or other malicious behaviors are evident in this snippet alone.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Issue identified:** Wildcard import can hide malicious code.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Risk 0.25, Confidence 0.5.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly cautious. Since the import source isn't inspected, the low malware score is appropriate. The risk score is modest, reflecting the potential danger of wildcard imports.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Issue identified:** Minimal code, no malicious activity.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Risk 0.1, Confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code appears benign, and the high confidence is justified.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Issue identified:** Wildcard import discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Risk 0, Confidence 1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity, just a standard import statement.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Issue identified:** Standard module initialization; no malicious behavior.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Risk 0, Confidence 1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Issue identified:** Wildcard import could hide malicious code; no evidence here.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Confidence 0.5.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The main concern is the wildcard import, but without inspecting `threads_post`, no malicious activity can be confirmed.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Evaluation & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior in this snippet.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, which is reasonable.\n- **Risk Scores:** Generally low, reflecting the potential danger of wildcard imports but acknowledging the lack of evidence.\n\n### **Potential Adjustments:**\n\n- The **risk scores** could be slightly increased if there's concern about the contents of `threads_post`, but without inspection, maintaining low scores is prudent.\n- The **confidence levels** are mostly high, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment & Recommendations**\n\n- **Overall malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to wildcard import, which can hide malicious code if present in `threads_post`)\n- **Confidence:** High (around 0.8-1), given the simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet is benign on its own. The main concern is the wildcard import, which warrants caution, but without inspecting the imported module, no malicious activity can be confirmed. The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimates:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk | Confidence |\n|---------|--------------|-------|------------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2   | 0.8-1      |\n\nProceed with caution regarding the contents of `threads_post`, but based solely on this snippet, no malicious activity is evident.",
