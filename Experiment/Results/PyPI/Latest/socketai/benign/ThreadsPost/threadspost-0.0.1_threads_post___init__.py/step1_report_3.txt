{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the module 'threads_post' and sets a version string for the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.threads_post', setting __version__",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data leaks or untrusted data processing",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable; only import and variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('*'), which is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious; no suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of an import statement and a version string. Wildcard imports can be a maintenance concern but do not indicate malicious intent by themselves. No data processing, network activity, or potentially malicious code is present. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving to import functionality from a module and set a version identifier. No malicious activity or security issues are evident.",
