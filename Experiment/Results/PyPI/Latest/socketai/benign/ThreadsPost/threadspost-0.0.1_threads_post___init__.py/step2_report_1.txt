  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code snippet.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All snippets are identical: a relative import from `threads_post` using `from .threads_post import *` and a version string assignment.\n- The primary concern across reports is the use of a wildcard import (`*`), which can hide malicious code if present in `threads_post`.\n- No direct evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data leaks is observed in these snippets.\n- The actual content of `threads_post` is unknown; thus, any malicious behavior depends on its implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- **Wildcard import (`from .threads_post import *`)**: This is generally discouraged because it can import unintended or malicious code, making security analysis difficult.\n- **No other issues are present** in the provided code snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- **Overreliance on the import statement alone**: The reports assume that because the snippet is minimal and contains no obvious malicious code, it is benign. However, the real risk lies in the contents of `threads_post`.\n- **Lack of inspection of `threads_post`**: All reports mention the import but do not analyze or request inspection of the imported module, which is critical to assess actual risk.\n- **Risk scoring**: Many reports assign a low or zero risk score based solely on this minimal code, which may underestimate the potential danger if `threads_post` contains malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score**: All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the code snippet. However, the risk is entirely dependent on `threads_post`.\n- **Obfuscated score**: All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk score**: Generally low, reflecting the minimal code, but the use of wildcard import warrants some caution.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Increase risk score if `threads_post` is untrusted or unverified**: Since the content of `threads_post` is unknown, the potential for malicious code exists.\n- **Malware score** should remain at 0 unless evidence of malicious code is found within `threads_post`.\n- **Obfuscated score** remains at 0 unless code within `threads_post` is obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Critical Points:\n- The reports correctly identify that the main concern is the wildcard import. This practice can hide malicious code.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified solely based on this snippet; the actual threat depends on the imported module.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\nGiven the information:\n- The code itself is benign but potentially risky due to the wildcard import.\n- The real security concern is the content of `threads_post`.\n\n**My assessment:**\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no evidence of malicious code in this snippet)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score**: 0.3 to 0.5, considering the risk introduced by wildcard import and unverified imported module.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code snippet is minimal and appears benign.\n- The main concern is the wildcard import, which can hide malicious code if present in `threads_post`.\n- Without inspecting `threads_post`, the actual risk cannot be fully assessed.\n- The current scores are reasonable, but I would recommend a **moderate security risk score (~0.4)** to reflect the potential danger of importing untrusted code via wildcard import.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always review the contents of imported modules, especially when wildcard imports are used, to ensure no malicious code is hidden.",
