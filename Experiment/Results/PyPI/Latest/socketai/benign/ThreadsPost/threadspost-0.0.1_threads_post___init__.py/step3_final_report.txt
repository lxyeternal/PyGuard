  "purpose": "Minimal module initialization with a wildcard import from a local module and a version string assignment.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .threads_post, which loads all names from the module.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, any untrusted code within threads_post could execute upon import, but no explicit sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import from threads_post could execute code during module load; no other data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import which can hide malicious or unintended code; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import with a wildcard, which is discouraged as it obscures imported names and can hide malicious code if present in threads_post. The version string is benign. No network activity, data leaks, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident. The risk depends on the contents of threads_post, which are unknown. The malware and obfuscated scores are zero, reflecting no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. The security risk score is modest (~0.2-0.3) due to the wildcard import's potential to conceal malicious code, but without inspecting threads_post, this cannot be confirmed. Confidence in the benign assessment is high, given the minimal and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet appears benign but uses a wildcard import, which can hide malicious code if present in threads_post. The actual risk depends on the imported module's content. Scores are appropriately low, with a cautious risk score to reflect potential concerns. Further inspection of threads_post is recommended to fully assess security.",
