{
  "purpose": "The code provides a client wrapper to interact with the Threads Graph API, enabling posting and replying to posts with support for media attachments.",
  "sources": "Input data from 'post_data' JSON file, 'access_token' and 'user_id' parameters, and API responses.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external API endpoints, especially requests.post and requests.get calls, which handle sensitive tokens, post IDs, and URLs.",
  "flows": "Input JSON data is read from file; access_token and user_id are used for authentication; API responses contain post IDs and permalinks; responses and IDs flow into URL construction and data storage; media upload and status checks involve request-response cycles.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets beyond access tokens; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution; API calls and error handling appear standard. Sensitive info (access tokens) are masked in logs. No suspicious network connections or data exfiltration observed. The code correctly manages exceptions and retries for network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured API client for posting content to Threads, with functions for creating posts, carousels, and replies. It validates input parameters, manages API interactions, and handles retries and status polling appropriately. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or unauthorized data access. The use of network requests with access tokens is expected and handled carefully, with masking in logs. No anomalous or suspicious behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or covert data exfiltration are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper designed for posting content to Threads. It performs expected functions securely, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe based on the provided implementation.",
