  "conclusion": "The code employs a pattern of decrypting and executing code dynamically, which is a significant security concern. While no explicit malicious payloads are present, the pattern itself can be exploited for malicious purposes. The high risk score (0.75) and malware score (0.6) reflect the inherent danger of such patterns. The obfuscation level is moderate to high due to encryption. Overall, this pattern warrants caution and should be considered high risk, especially in open-source dependencies."
