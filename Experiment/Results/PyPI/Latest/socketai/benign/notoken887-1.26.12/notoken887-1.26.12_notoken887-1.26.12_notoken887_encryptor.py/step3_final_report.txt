  "purpose": "A simple reversible character substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings using emojis and symbols.",
  "sources": "The methods read input strings and perform character replacements for encoding and decoding.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network activity, or system modifications are present; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input string characters are mapped to emojis in 'encrypt' and emojis back to characters in 'decrypt' via direct replacement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, static character-to-emoji mappings with no dynamic or obfuscated code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a deterministic, symmetric substitution cipher using extensive replace calls. It does not depend on external data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The purpose appears to be simple obfuscation or playful encoding, not cryptography. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious behaviors are evident. The 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods are inverse operations, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The substitution cipher is insecure for cryptographic purposes but poses no malicious threat in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward reversible string transformation utility for obfuscation. It contains no malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware and security risk, and the obfuscation level is minimal. Overall, it is safe and non-malicious.",
