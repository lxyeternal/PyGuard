{
  "purpose": "The class TokenCryptor provides simple substitution encryption and decryption of strings using emoji characters as a cipher.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the encrypt() and decrypt() methods with the 'string' parameter and 'encrypted_token' parameter, respectively.",
  "sinks": "The code replaces characters based on predefined mappings; no external data sinks or data leaks are evident. There are no network connections or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input string passes into encrypt() or decrypt(), undergoes character replacements, and outputs the transformed string. There are no complex data flows or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward character substitutions without any apparent obfuscation, external data handling, or hidden behavior. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic substitution cipher with a static mapping between characters and emojis. Both functions are simple and symmetrical, with no external dependencies, no input validation, and no side effects. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or backdoors. The code appears to be intended for obfuscation or playful encoding rather than security. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. It does not attempt to access network resources, manipulate system files, or perform harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign implementation of a substitution cipher using emojis. It does not exhibit any malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is straightforward and safe, with no signs of sabotage or harmful behavior.",
