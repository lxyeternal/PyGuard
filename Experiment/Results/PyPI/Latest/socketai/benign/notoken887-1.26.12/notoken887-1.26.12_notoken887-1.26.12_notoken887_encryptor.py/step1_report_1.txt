{
  "purpose": "This class provides simple obfuscation (not encryption) for strings by replacing characters with emojis and other symbols, and vice versa, effectively creating a reversible encoding scheme.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods.",
  "sinks": "Return values of 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods; no other data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input string → 'encrypt' method (character replacements) → output encoded string; encoded string → 'decrypt' method (reverse replacements) → original string.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward character replacement for encoding/decoding; no hardcoded secrets, external inputs, or network operations. No obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden backdoors are present. No external data sources or sinks are utilized. The methods only perform deterministic replacements, indicating simple reversible encoding rather than encryption.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a reversible character substitution scheme converting alphanumeric and some symbols into emojis and other symbols. The replacements are purely character mappings with no external dependencies or data processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is well-structured, straightforward, and focused solely on reversible string obfuscation. No suspicious anomalies or malicious logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign reversible encoding/decoding utility using character substitution. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks within this module.",
