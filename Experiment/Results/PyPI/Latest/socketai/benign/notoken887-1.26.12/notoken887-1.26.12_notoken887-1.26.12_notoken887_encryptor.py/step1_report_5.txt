{
  "purpose": "The class TokenCryptor provides simple obfuscation by replacing alphanumeric characters and certain symbols with emoji and other characters for the purpose of encoding and decoding strings.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the encrypt() and decrypt() methods, which receive data for encoding and decoding.",
  "sinks": "Return statements output the transformed strings; no external data sinks or network connections are directly involved.",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed to encrypt() which maps characters to symbols/emojis, and decrypt() which reverses this mapping. The flow is straightforward character replacement both ways.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs extensive character replacement with no validation, encryption, or security-related logic; it appears purely as a custom obfuscation method. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No obfuscated code patterns or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The class offers a reversible character substitution cipher using emoji and special characters. It neither reads external inputs beyond method parameters nor writes to external systems. No network operations, file I/O, or environment variable access are present. The approach is simple character mapping, likely for basic obfuscation or playful encoding, not encryption. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. All code is straightforward and intentionally designed for reversible transformations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, providing a basic reversible character substitution without malicious intent or security risks. It does not exhibit malware characteristics or security vulnerabilities.",
