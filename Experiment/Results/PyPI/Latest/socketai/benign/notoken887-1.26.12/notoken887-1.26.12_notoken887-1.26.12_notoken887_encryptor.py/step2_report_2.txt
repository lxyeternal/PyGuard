  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their conclusions with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**General observations about the code:**\n\n- The `TokenCryptor` class performs simple, deterministic character replacements for encoding and decoding.\n- No external dependencies, network operations, or system commands are present.\n- The methods are symmetric, with each replacement in `encrypt` matched by a corresponding reverse replacement in `decrypt`.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code patterns are evident.\n- The approach is a basic substitution cipher, primarily for obfuscation or playful encoding, not cryptographic security.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Clarifies that this is simple obfuscation, not encryption.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, external data, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign reversible encoding utility.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is straightforward, with no malicious intent. The report's confidence is high, and the malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above—simple substitution cipher.\n- **Findings:** No external data, network activity, or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, with negligible security risk.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (slightly above zero, perhaps reflecting the insecurity of substitution ciphers but not maliciousness)\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is not malicious; the minor security risk score reflects the insecurity of substitution ciphers, not malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Reversible substitution cipher with emojis.\n- **Findings:** No external dependencies or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, safe, no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malware or malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Basic encoding/decoding via substitution.\n- **Findings:** No external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, simple transformation tool.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Reversible substitution cipher, mainly for obfuscation.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, external data, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malware or security vulnerabilities.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of all reports:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code performs simple, deterministic character replacements.\n- No external dependencies, network activity, or malicious code are present.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- The security risk scores are minimal, reflecting the insecurity of substitution ciphers but not maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n### **Final evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated code; it's straightforward character replacement)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent)\n\n---\n\n### **Additional notes:**\n\n- The code is purely for reversible obfuscation, not encryption.\n- Its security is minimal; substitution ciphers are insecure for protecting sensitive data.\n- There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent with the code's behavior. I agree with their assessments. The malware score should remain at **0**, obfuscated at **0**, and security risk at **0**. The code is benign, straightforward, and intended for simple reversible string transformations.",
