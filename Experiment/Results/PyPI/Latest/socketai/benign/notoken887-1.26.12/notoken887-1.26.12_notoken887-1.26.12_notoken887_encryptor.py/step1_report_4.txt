{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods for simple character-based substitution encryption and decryption of strings, transforming characters into emoji or symbol representations and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input data is taken from the 'string' parameter in 'encrypt' and 'encrypted_token' parameter in 'decrypt'.",
  "sinks": "The functions perform replacements on strings, but do not write to external systems, files, or network, nor do they handle untrusted external input beyond the parameters.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed through sequential character replacements, converting characters to emojis in 'encrypt' and emojis back to characters in 'decrypt'. No external data flow or untrusted data handling beyond input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code exclusively performs static string replacements with no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no network activity. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward character substitution for encoding and decoding strings using predefined mappings. It lacks any external data sources, network communication, or cryptographic operations. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present; the functions are deterministic and solely manipulate string data based on hardcoded mappings. The design is simplistic and does not involve any complex or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The class provides basic encoding/decoding functionality via character substitution with emojis and symbols. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The code appears benign and solely serves as a simple transformation tool.",
