  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform some form of data processing or utility function, likely involving input handling and possibly data output or manipulation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, or possibly external files or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Data might be written to files, sent over network sockets, or used in system commands, APIs, or database queries.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input functions or environment variables through processing functions and eventually reaches sinks like output statements, network transmissions, or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "Potential anomalies include hardcoded credentials, suspicious function names, dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual import statements. Check for any code that silently suppresses exceptions or uses eval/exec with untrusted data.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be straightforward with standard imports and functions. No obfuscated language features or unnecessary dynamic execution detected. There are no obvious hardcoded secrets or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate and consistent with typical application functions. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed within this fragment. The overall structure is typical, and no malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or malware. It seems to serve a benign purpose with no evidence of security risks or malicious intent. The code appears well-structured and free of anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
