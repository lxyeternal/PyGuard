  "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate suspicion due to potential obfuscation and dynamic code execution, but no confirmed malicious activity. The overall security risk remains low if code is verified to be safe. Scores are consistent with the evidence, with a malware score around 0.2-0.3 and obfuscation around 0.2-0.4, depending on suspicion levels. Continuous monitoring and code review are recommended, especially for dynamic execution patterns."
