  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential dynamic code execution (eval/exec), environment variables, network or file I/O, hardcoded credentials.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writes, dynamic execution points, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or untrusted input flow into eval/exec or network/file sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, obfuscation patterns, hardcoded credentials, misleading variable names, missing or suspicious import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits suspicion primarily if eval/exec are used, especially with obfuscated code or misleading variable names. The absence of explicit malicious payloads reduces certainty. The code's structure and patterns suggest moderate concern if dynamic execution or obfuscation are confirmed. No evidence of malicious payloads such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or system damage is present. The scores reflect moderate suspicion where patterns are present, with high confidence in benign assessments otherwise.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate suspicion due to potential obfuscation and dynamic code execution, but no confirmed malicious activity. The overall security risk remains low if code is verified to be safe. Scores are consistent with the evidence, with a malware score around 0.2-0.3 and obfuscation around 0.2-0.4, depending on suspicion levels. Continuous monitoring and code review are recommended, especially for dynamic execution patterns.",
