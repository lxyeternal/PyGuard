{
  "purpose": "This code provides a weather information service using the OpenWeather API, allowing users to query weather data for specified cities.",
  "sources": "Reads API key from command-line argument, fetches weather data from OpenWeather API over HTTP using user-provided city names.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request to external API, output formatting and display, potential logging of errors or data.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> fetch_weather() (uses API key and city) -> HTTP request -> response -> format_weather() -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "API key is initially set to 'None' as a string, then overwritten by command-line argument; no hardcoded credentials. No suspicious data flows or code constructs observed. No backdoors, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The code relies on standard libraries and the mcp framework without evident malicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code securely fetches weather data from an external API using user-provided API key. It does not contain any hardcoded secrets or malicious code. It properly handles exceptions and does not perform any unsafe operations like code injection, data leakage, or system manipulation. The external HTTP request uses standard libraries without suspicious patterns. No anomalies such as obfuscated code, backdoors, or unauthorized data transmission are present. The API key is provided via command-line, which is a common practice. The overall logic is straightforward and adheres to best practices for a weather data service.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and designed solely for weather data retrieval and formatting. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on this analysis.",
