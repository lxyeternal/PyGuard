{
  "purpose": "The code implements a weather query server that fetches weather data from OpenWeather API and formats it for users, integrating with a custom server framework (FastMCP).",
  "sources": "Reads user input for city names via the 'query_weather' function and command-line argument for API key; accesses external API endpoint 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather'.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP requests to the OpenWeather API endpoint; returns JSON responses; processes and formats data for output.",
  "flows": "User provides city name; 'query_weather' calls 'fetch_weather'; which constructs API request with API_KEY; response is received, then processed and returned via 'format_weather'.",
  "anomalies": "API_KEY is set via command-line argument, which is standard; no hardcoded credentials; no use of environment variables for sensitive data; no suspicious or obfuscated code patterns; no hidden backdoors or unusual data handling.",
  "analysis": "The script fetches weather data from an external API, formats it, and outputs the result. The API_KEY is supplied explicitly by the user at runtime, reducing risk of hardcoded secrets. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or unauthorized system access. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are evident. The only potential concern is the exposure of API keys if logs are improperly stored, but this is outside the scope of this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical weather query server with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely handles user input and external API communication without suspicious behaviors.",
