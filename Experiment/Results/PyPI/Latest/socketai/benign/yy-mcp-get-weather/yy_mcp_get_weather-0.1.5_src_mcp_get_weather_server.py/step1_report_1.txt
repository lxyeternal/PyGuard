{
  "purpose": "This code provides a weather query service that fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API and formats it for display, integrating with a server framework (FastMCP).",
  "sources": "API_KEY input via command-line argument, user input for city name in query_weather function.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request to external API (httpx), returning weather data or errors.",
  "flows": "Input API_KEY and city name → fetch_weather makes HTTP GET request with API_KEY → data returned to format_weather → formatted string output.",
  "anomalies": "API_KEY is initially set to 'None' as a string, which may cause runtime issues; no hardcoded secrets other than the API key placeholder. The API key is supplied via command-line argument, which is standard. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. External HTTP request is normal for such applications.",
  "analysis": "The code securely fetches weather data from an external API using user-provided API key, formats the data, and returns it. The API key is not hardcoded but supplied at runtime, reducing risk of embedded secrets. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, system commands, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The only potential issue is the initial placeholder API_KEY='None', which relies on user input, but this is a normal pattern. The code does not perform any unsafe operations or handle untrusted input in a vulnerable manner. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard weather query service with no malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on user input for the API key and makes external HTTP requests in a typical manner. No malicious or suspicious patterns are detected.",
