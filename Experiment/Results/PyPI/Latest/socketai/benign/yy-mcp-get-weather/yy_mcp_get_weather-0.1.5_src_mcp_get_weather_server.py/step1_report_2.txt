{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to fetch weather data from the OpenWeather API and format it for display, integrating with a server framework for remote querying.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command-line argument (--api_key) for API key; reads city name input from function parameter in query_weather.",
  "sinks": "Uses the API key (provided at runtime) in API request headers/parameters; outputs formatted weather information.",
  "flows": "API key input flows into the fetch_weather function via global variable; city name input flows from query_weather parameter to fetch_weather; response data flows from API to format_weather for output.",
  "anomalies": "API key is initialized as 'None' string, then overwritten; no hardcoded credentials; no suspicious or malicious code detected; API key management relies on user input; no data leaks or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely fetches data using standard HTTP requests, formats JSON responses, and handles exceptions properly. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data are stored insecurely. The API key is provided at runtime, which minimizes risk. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated parts, or suspicious behaviors. The server framework (mcp) appears to be standard, and no network connections beyond API requests are evident. Overall, the code appears legitimate and free from malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a weather data fetcher with proper input handling and no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets or malicious logic. The only sensitive information is the API key, which is supplied at runtime by the user, aligning with best practices.",
