  "purpose": "Fetches weather data from OpenWeather API for a specified city and formats the output.",
  "sources": "User input for city name, API key provided via command-line argument, external HTTP GET request to OpenWeather API.",
  "sinks": "Response data from the API, formatted output string.",
  "flows": "User inputs city name -> fetch_weather() constructs request with API key -> HTTP request to API endpoint -> response processed and formatted.",
  "anomalies": "Initial API_KEY set to string 'None', but overwritten at runtime; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard external API call to retrieve weather data, with proper error handling. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are present. The API key is supplied at runtime, reducing risk of leakage. No obfuscation or malicious code is detected. The placeholder 'None' for API_KEY is a benign default, overwritten by user input. The code's structure is straightforward, with clear source-to-sink data flow. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign weather data fetcher with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external API interaction and runtime API key handling. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting very low risk.",
