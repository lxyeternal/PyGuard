{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes the main function from the 'mcp_get_weather' package, likely to retrieve weather data.",
  "sources": "The import statement from 'mcp_get_weather' module, which could potentially read external data during import or execution of 'main()'.",
  "sinks": "The 'main()' function could potentially send or store data, but without the implementation details, no specific sinks are identifiable from this code alone.",
  "flows": "Data flow depends on 'main()' behavior, which is unknown; it might process or transmit data based on weather retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code provided; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns visible. The code directly calls 'main()' after import, which is typical for simple scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports 'main' from 'mcp_get_weather' and executes it. Without insight into the 'mcp_get_weather' package or 'main()' implementation, no malicious behavior can be confirmed. The code itself appears benign and typical for an entry point script.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code snippet, there are no apparent malicious behaviors or security risks. It is a minimal script that executes a function from an external module. Due to lack of further details about the module's internal behavior, the risk remains low.",
