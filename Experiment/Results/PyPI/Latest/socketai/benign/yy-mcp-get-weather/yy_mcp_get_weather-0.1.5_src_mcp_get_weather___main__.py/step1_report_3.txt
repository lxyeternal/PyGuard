{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes the main function from the mcp_get_weather module, likely to retrieve weather data.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'main' from 'mcp_get_weather' and execution of main()",
  "sinks": "Potentially any code within 'main()' of 'mcp_get_weather', which is not visible here",
  "flows": "Data flows depend on the implementation of 'main()' in 'mcp_get_weather'; no explicit flow in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code constructs are visible; the code is straightforward and minimal",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports and calls a function from an external module. Without access to the 'mcp_get_weather' module's source, we cannot evaluate its internal behavior or security posture. The minimal code structure poses no apparent malicious intent or suspicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or insecure patterns are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign and standard, serving to execute a weather data retrieval process via an external module. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are detectable within this snippet.",
