{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes the main function from the 'mcp_get_weather' module, likely to retrieve weather data.",
  "sources": "The code reads no user input or external data directly; it simply calls an imported function.",
  "sinks": "The code itself does not contain any explicit sinks; potential issues depend on the behavior of 'main()' from 'mcp_get_weather'.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'main' to executing 'main()'. No data flows are explicitly shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function from an external module and calls it immediately. There is no indication of malicious behavior or obfuscated code. The overall structure is simple and conventional. Any malicious activity would depend entirely on the implementation of 'main()' in the 'mcp_get_weather' module, which is not provided here. The code itself appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a basic function call with no obvious malicious intent. Without inspecting 'mcp_get_weather', no malicious activity can be confirmed. The code appears safe in its current form.",
