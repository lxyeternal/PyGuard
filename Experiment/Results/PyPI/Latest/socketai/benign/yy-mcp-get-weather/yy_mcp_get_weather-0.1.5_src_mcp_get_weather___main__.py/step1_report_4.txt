{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes the main function from the 'mcp_get_weather' module, likely to fetch or process weather data.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'mcp_get_weather' module",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() function, which may perform external actions such as network requests or data processing",
  "flows": "Import from 'mcp_get_weather' → execution of main()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple import and function call, no hardcoded secrets or unusual code features",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly imports a single function from a module and executes it. Without inspecting 'mcp_get_weather', no malicious activity can be confirmed or denied, but the code itself is minimal and typical. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply calls a main function from an external module, which appears to be related to weather data retrieval. There are no evident malicious behaviors or security risks present in this minimal snippet.",
