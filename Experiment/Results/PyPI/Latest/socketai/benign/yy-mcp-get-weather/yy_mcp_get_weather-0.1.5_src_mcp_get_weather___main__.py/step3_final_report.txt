{
  "purpose": "Minimal script invoking main() from mcp_get_weather module, likely to execute weather data retrieval or processing.",
  "sources": "Import statement from mcp_get_weather; execution of main() function",
  "sinks": "Potential internal behavior of mcp_get_weather.main(), which could include network activity, data handling, or other operations",
  "flows": "Import of main() from module, then execution; internal behavior depends on mcp_get_weather's implementation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns visible in this snippet",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing and executing a single function. No secrets or suspicious constructs are present. The security implications depend entirely on the internal implementation of main() within mcp_get_weather, which is unknown. The code itself appears benign, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with this assessment. The primary concern is the behavior of the external module, which cannot be evaluated here. Overall, the code is low risk and appears safe in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign and straightforward, with no internal signs of malicious activity. The security risk is minimal, contingent on the trustworthiness of mcp_get_weather's implementation. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the available information.",
