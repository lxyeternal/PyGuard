  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code:\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom .server import main\n```\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- The code is a simple import statement.\n- It imports 'main' from a local module 'server' using relative import syntax.\n- No data processing, network activity, or execution beyond import.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n- **Purpose:** All describe importing 'main' from 'server' (or '.server')—a standard modular pattern.\n- **Sources:** Correctly identify local module import.\n- **Sinks:** None identified; no output, network, or external calls.\n- **Flows:** No data flows or execution flows, just import.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All conclude benign, standard import statements with no malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high confidence)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0\n\n**Overall, all reports are consistent and accurate.**\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The import itself is not malicious; however, the real security concern depends on what 'main' does when invoked.\n- Since the code only imports, without executing or passing data, there's no immediate security risk.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are appropriate given the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct; no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated (0):** Correct; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score (0):** Correct; no security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code snippet is a benign, standard import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores reflect this accurately.",
