  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code snippet:\n\n**Code under review:**\n```python\nfrom .server import main\n```\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- All reports describe the same minimal import statement.\n- The code is a standard Python import, referencing a local module (`.server`) and a symbol (`main`).\n- No data processing, network activity, or execution beyond import is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No, the code is straightforward and typical for modular Python applications.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  None identified. The import is syntactically correct and common.\n\n- **Scores review:**\n  - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n  - The confidence is 1 across all reports, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  No. All scores are 0, indicating no security concern.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Since the code only imports a symbol from a local module, and no malicious behavior is indicated, malware score remains 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The reports are thorough and agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code snippet is a common pattern in Python projects.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the minimal and benign nature of this code snippet, **the scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.** The confidence remains high because the analysis is straightforward.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a standard import statement with no malicious or risky implications. The scores are appropriate and should not be adjusted upward.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; this code is safe and benign.",
