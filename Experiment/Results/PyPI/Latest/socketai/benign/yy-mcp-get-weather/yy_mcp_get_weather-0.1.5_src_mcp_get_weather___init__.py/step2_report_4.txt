  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code snippets.\n\n**Code under review:**\n```python\nfrom .server import main\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports describe the same minimal import statement.\n- The code is a standard Python import, referencing a local module `server`.\n- No data processing, network calls, or external inputs are involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code appears to be part of a larger application where `main` is invoked elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The import statement itself is correct and does not contain issues. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Malware:** Score of 0 across all reports is appropriate; nothing indicates malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated:** Score of 0 is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Score of 0 is justified; no risks are apparent from this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis of Reports:\n- **Logical consistency:** All reports correctly identify that this is a benign import statement with no malicious or security concerns.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign maximum confidence (1) and zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Potential issues:** No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; the reports are cautious and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **risk score** should remain at **0**; no reason to elevate it.\n- The **malware score** should stay at **0**; nothing malicious is detected.\n- The **obfuscated score** remains at **0**; code is clear.\n- The **confidence** score is justified at **1** given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, standard import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo changes are necessary. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
