  "purpose": "Import the main function from a local module named server.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing code from a relative module (server.py).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows observed; only an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a simple import of 'main' from a local module 'server'. This is a standard practice in Python to organize code into modules. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. No obfuscated code, external network calls, or other suspicious patterns are present. Given the minimal nature, it appears to be a part of a larger program where 'main' is invoked elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a common pattern for modular Python applications.",
