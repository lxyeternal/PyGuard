{
  "purpose": "Import the 'main' function or object from the local 'server' module, likely to run or initialize server-related functionality.",
  "sources": "The code imports a local module 'server' and accesses its 'main' attribute or function.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if 'main' executes untrusted code or performs network operations, that would be a sink, but the import statement itself does not contain sinks.",
  "flows": "The code only imports 'main' from 'server'; no data flow or execution flow is visible in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in this single-line import statement. It is a standard import statement with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple relative import of 'main' from the local module 'server'. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code. Without additional context, this appears to be a benign import statement used to invoke or utilize server functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any operations that could lead to data leakage, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.",
