  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet:\n\nOriginal Code:\n```python\nfrom .server import main\n```\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a simple import statement, importing 'main' from a local module 'server'.\n- There are no data flows, no execution of code, no network activity, and no suspicious constructs.\n- The reports uniformly conclude benign intent, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that this is a straightforward import statement with no malicious behavior.\n\n### Logical reasoning and analysis:\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. The reasoning is consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign and standard.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Confidence scores:** All reports give a confidence of 1, which is reasonable given the simplicity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is correct because there's no malware activity.\n- **Security risk scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since all reports agree and the code is benign, the risk scores are appropriately low.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports assume that the import is benign because there's no additional context. This is reasonable; an import statement alone isn't malicious.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; they correctly identify the code as harmless.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThese scores are consistent with the code and the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the collective analysis.",
