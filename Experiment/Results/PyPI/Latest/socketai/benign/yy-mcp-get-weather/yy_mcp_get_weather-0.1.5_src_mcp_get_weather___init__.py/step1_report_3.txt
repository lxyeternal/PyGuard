{
  "purpose": "Import the main function from the server module, likely for application startup or server control.",
  "sources": "The code imports a function from a local module (.server). No external data input or reading occurs here.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data output, network connections, or external commands are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident, as this is a single import statement without runtime behavior shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function called main from a local module named server. This is a typical pattern for modular Python applications. No suspicious or malicious behavior is identifiable from this single line. As it does not execute any code or perform actions beyond importing, there's no evident security concern or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing a standard import operation with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
