  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow involving untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only an import statement; no anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement bringing in 'main' from a local module 'server'. This does not involve data processing, user input, or external data sources. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The import appears standard for modular Python code structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs a simple import without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
