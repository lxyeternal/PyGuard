  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code snippet in question is: `from .server import main`\n- It is a simple import statement importing 'main' from a local module 'server'.\n- No data flows, external network calls, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of this code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's presence and behavior:\n\n**Does the code match the description?**  \nYes. All reports describe a straightforward import statement with no additional logic, which aligns with the code snippet.\n\n**Are there any errors or flaws in the reports' reasoning?**  \nNo. The reasoning is consistent, and the conclusion that this is benign is well-supported.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of scores:\n\n**Malware score:**  \nAll reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \nAll reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Security risk score:**  \nAll reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. Importing a module is not inherently risky.\n\n**Confidence:**  \nAll reports have confidence 1, justified given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n**Adjustments:**  \nNo adjustments needed. The assessments are accurate.\n\n**Additional insights:**  \nGiven the code's simplicity, the overall risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent.\n- The reports correctly identify the lack of vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n| Score Type     | Suggested Value | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| malware        | 0                 | No malicious behavior or payloads observed.                |\n| obfuscated     | 0                 | Code is clear, straightforward, no obfuscation.            |\n| securityRisk   | 0                 | Importing a local module is not risky.                      |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, and the current scores are accurate. No further action or concern is warranted based on this snippet.",
