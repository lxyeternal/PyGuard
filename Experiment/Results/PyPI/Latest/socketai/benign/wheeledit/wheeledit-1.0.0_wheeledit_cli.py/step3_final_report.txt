  "purpose": "A utility script for editing Python wheel files, allowing renaming, metadata updates, and re-packaging.",
  "sources": "File input paths, metadata files (JSON or METADATA), command-line arguments for renaming and metadata updates",
  "sinks": "File system for reading/writing wheel files and metadata; no untrusted data sinks identified",
  "flows": "Input files and arguments are read; metadata and filenames are processed; wheel files are unpacked, modified, and repackaged",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected; standard file operations only",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard wheel file manipulations with input validation, error handling, and external library usage. No malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation is present. External dependency 'wheeledit.editor' is assumed benign. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent. Security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, and confidence in benign assessment is high.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, benign utility for wheel file management with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior and content.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
