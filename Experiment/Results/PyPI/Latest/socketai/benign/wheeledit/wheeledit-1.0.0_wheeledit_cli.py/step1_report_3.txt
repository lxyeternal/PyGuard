{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to modify or display metadata of Python wheel files, including renaming, updating metadata, and processing multiple files or directories.",
  "sources": "Input wheel files, metadata files (JSON or METADATA), and command-line arguments for modifications.",
  "sinks": "File operations such as reading metadata files, renaming files, unpacking and repackaging wheel files, and writing output files.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> Validation -> Processing wheel files (unpack, modify, repackage) -> Output files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Use of external library 'wheeledit.editor' is not suspicious by itself. Error handling is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are present. The code performs file system operations and JSON parsing securely. No suspicious patterns in filename handling or data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate file management and wheel modification functions using standard libraries and a custom editor class. It validates input paths and filenames, handles JSON and METADATA formats safely, and cleans up resources. The flow is straightforward, with no evident malicious intent or malicious code injection. There are no network operations, cryptography, or hidden behaviors. The only external dependency is 'wheeledit.editor', which appears to be a standard package for wheel editing. The code uses proper error handling and avoids executing untrusted data. Overall, it appears to be a benign utility script for wheel file management.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate wheel editing utility with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles files securely, performs expected operations, and does not include any suspicious or malicious code patterns. The risk of malware is very low.",
