  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script or module, but since no actual code was provided, the purpose cannot be precisely determined. It might be intended for data processing, utility functions, or other general purposes.",
  "sources": "Input sources could include environment variables, user input via functions like input(), command-line arguments, or data read from files or network connections. However, no specific source code is provided to identify actual sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing to files, executing system commands, making network requests, or executing code dynamically. No specific sinks are identified due to lack of actual code.",
  "flows": "Without concrete code, it is impossible to determine specific data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hard-coded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated sections, are observable in the absence of actual code. No unusual patterns or risky constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The analysis is limited by the absence of code content. Typically, a thorough review would involve examining imported libraries, data handling, and any dynamic code execution. As no code is present, no such evaluation can be performed.",
  "conclusion": "No code provided for review; therefore, no malicious behavior or security risks can be identified. The code's purpose and potential risks remain indeterminate without further information.",
