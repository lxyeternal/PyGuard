  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential data inputs such as user input, environment variables, external data files, network connections, and environment configurations.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file I/O, environment variables, and logs where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions to sinks (outputs or external communications).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs observed; no evidence of eval/exec with untrusted data.",
  "analysis": "The code appears standard, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the absence of suspicious patterns. Moderate security risk scores (0.3) in some reports reflect potential external communication or data handling but lack concrete malicious indicators. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited code context.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. Security risk scores are justified based on data transmission points. Overall, the code appears benign, and the scores are consistent with the analysis.",
