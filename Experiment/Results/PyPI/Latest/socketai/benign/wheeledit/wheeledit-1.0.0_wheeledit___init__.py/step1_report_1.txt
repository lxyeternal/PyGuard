  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, function parameters, or external files. Specific input sources cannot be identified without code details.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file operations, or data processing functions that could expose or transmit data. Exact sink points are not evident without code details.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks potentially through functions or variable assignments, but specifics are unavailable due to lack of code content.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are identified based on the provided input, which is absent.",
  "analysis": "Unable to perform detailed analysis due to lack of provided code. Typically, one would examine source data inputs, how they are processed, and where they might be transmitted or stored insecurely. Without code, it's not possible to identify specific malicious behaviors or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "No conclusive evidence of malicious behavior or security issues can be determined without the actual code. The assessment cannot be completed due to missing code content.",
