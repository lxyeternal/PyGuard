{
  "purpose": "The code appears to serve as an entry point for a command-line interface (CLI) application, importing the main function from a local module and executing it, then exiting with its return code.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system input (via import sys and sys.exit), and the main function from a local module (.cli import main).",
  "sinks": "The sys.exit call potentially terminates the process based on the main function's return value, which could be influenced by untrusted data if the main function processes external input.",
  "flows": "Input data (via sys or within main) flows into the main function, which then influences the exit code; however, the code snippet itself does not show internal data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code itself is minimal and straightforward, with no obvious anomalies or suspicious code segments. It does not perform any data processing or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module and a local main function from the cli module. It then calls sys.exit(main()), which terminates the program with the status code returned by main(). There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or dynamic code execution shown. The structure is typical for a CLI application entry point. Since no internal implementation of main() is provided, any malicious behavior would depend on that function, not on this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple CLI entry point and contains no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. Its security risk is minimal based solely on this snippet, but overall safety depends on the implementation of the main() function in the cli module.",
