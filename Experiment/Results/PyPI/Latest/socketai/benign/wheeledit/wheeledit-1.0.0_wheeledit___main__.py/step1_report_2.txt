{
  "purpose": "The code appears to invoke a command-line interface (CLI) main function and then exit the program.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly, but indirectly depends on the behavior of the imported 'main' function from '.cli'.",
  "sinks": "The code calls sys.exit() with the result of main(), which could terminate the process with an exit code potentially influenced by 'main'.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into 'main()' from the environment or user, then the output of 'main()' flows into sys.exit(), which terminates the process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for CLI entry points.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and a 'main' function from a local module. It then executes main() and exits with its return value. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. Because the actual behavior depends on the imported 'main()', which isn't shown, potential malicious activity could reside there, but based solely on this snippet, there's no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical CLI entry point, delegating execution to 'main()' and then terminating. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet itself.",
