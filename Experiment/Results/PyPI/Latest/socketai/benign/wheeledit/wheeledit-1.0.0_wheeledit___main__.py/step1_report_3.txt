{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point that calls the main function from a CLI module and exits with its return code.",
  "sources": "sys and .cli import, and the call to main() which likely reads command-line arguments or user input.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit, which terminates the process with the result of main().",
  "flows": "Input from command-line or environment -> main() -> sys.exit()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated parts, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the system module and a main function from a local module. It then calls main() and exits with its return code. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious data flows. The code appears to be a standard CLI entry point.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical application entry script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
