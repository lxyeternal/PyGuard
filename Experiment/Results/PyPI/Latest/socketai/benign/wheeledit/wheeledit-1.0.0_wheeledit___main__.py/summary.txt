  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI entry point with no inherent malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors visible in the snippet. The security assessment should include review of the 'main()' function in the '.cli' module, but based solely on this code, it is benign. The assigned scores are appropriate, with a very low risk level reflecting the external dependency."
