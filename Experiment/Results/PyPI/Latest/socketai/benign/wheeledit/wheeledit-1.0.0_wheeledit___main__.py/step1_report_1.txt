  "purpose": "This code is designed to execute the main function from the 'cli' module and then exit the program with its return value.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'sys' module and 'main' function from a local 'cli' module.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit() function which terminates the program using the value returned by main().",
  "flows": "Import sys -> execute sys.exit(main()) -> program terminates.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code structure is straightforward and typical for command-line interface scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module and a main function from a local cli module, then calls sys.exit() with the result of main(). There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a standard entry point for a command-line application. No data leakage, malicious commands, or suspicious network activity are present. The code's simplicity suggests it is a typical script to run a CLI application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard entry point for a CLI application, executing main() and exiting. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
