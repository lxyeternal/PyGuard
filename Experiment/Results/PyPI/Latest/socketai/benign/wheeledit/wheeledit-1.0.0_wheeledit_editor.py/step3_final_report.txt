  "purpose": "A utility for unpacking, editing, and repackaging Python wheel files, including renaming packages, replacing files, and updating metadata.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads during unpacking, metadata updates, file replacements, and directory listings.",
  "sinks": "File writes during metadata updates, file replacements, and repackage operations.",
  "flows": "Filesystem operations flow from unpacking to modifications and then to repackage, with no network activity or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. Uses external 'wheel.cli' tools legitimately. Suppresses stdout during unpacking, which could hide errors but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard filesystem manipulations for package maintenance: unpacking wheel files, renaming directories and metadata, replacing files, updating the RECORD file, and reassembling the wheel. It relies on legitimate external tools and does not contain network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code. The operations are typical for package editing utilities. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are present. The potential for misuse exists if malicious files are supplied or if the tool is used maliciously, but this is inherent to any package modification utility and not specific to this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for wheel file editing with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, reflecting potential misuse but no inherent malicious behavior. The malware and obfuscated scores are zero, aligning with the analysis.",
