  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Flask setup relying on environment variables for configuration. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The primary security consideration is the absence of validation for the environment variable, which could cause misconfiguration but does not indicate malicious activity. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, and no modifications are necessary."
