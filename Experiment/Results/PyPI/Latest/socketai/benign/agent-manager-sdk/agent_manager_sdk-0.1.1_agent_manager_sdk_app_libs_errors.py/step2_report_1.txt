  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of static class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from a base exception class.\n   - No dynamic code, external calls, data processing, or input handling are present.\n   - The classes only define error codes, descriptions, and HTTP status codes as static attributes.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are observed.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no suspicious patterns, no external dependencies involved in data handling, and no malicious constructs.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the static, non-malicious nature of the code.\n   - The confidence level is 1, which is justified based on the straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - Since the code only defines exception classes with static attributes, there is no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n   - The code does not perform any external calls, data handling, or dynamic behavior that could be exploited.\n   - No supply chain or malicious intent is evident.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - They focus on the actual code structure, which is safe.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (No malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (Code is straightforward, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (No security risks identified)\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The code is purely for error handling, a common pattern in web applications.\n- No dynamic or external code execution, no data leaks, no secrets.\n- The static nature of the classes makes it inherently safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores and analysis are accurate and appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are justified and should remain as is.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain current scores and trust the analysis.",
