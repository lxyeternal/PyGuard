{
  "purpose": "Define custom HTTP exception classes for user authentication and account management errors.",
  "sources": "Imports from libs.exception module, class attributes setting error codes, descriptions, and HTTP status codes.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or processes untrusted data directly; it only defines exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code is static class definitions with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The structure is straightforward and typical for exception definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a base exception class and defines several subclasses representing specific error types related to user account operations. Each class assigns static attributes such as error_code, description, and HTTP status code. There are no dynamic inputs, external data processing, or network operations. No signs of malicious behavior or security issues are present. The code appears to serve as part of an API's error handling system, with clear, static definitions. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for an API, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be safe, purely defining error types.",
