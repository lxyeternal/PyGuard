  "purpose": "Define custom HTTP exception classes for user authentication and account management errors",
  "sources": "None (static class definitions, no data input or external data read)",
  "sinks": "None (no data processing, output, or external system interaction)",
  "flows": "None (no data flow or untrusted data handling within the code)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected; code consists of straightforward class definitions inheriting from a base exception",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from BaseHTTPException, each representing specific error scenarios related to user password management and account status. There are no external data inputs, no data manipulation, and no interactions with network or system resources. The code is static, clean, and adheres to typical pattern for custom exceptions in Python. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions for error handling in a web application. It does not contain any malicious code or security risks.",
