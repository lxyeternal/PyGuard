  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from `BaseHTTPException`.\n   - Each class has static attributes: `error_code`, `description`, and `code`.\n   - No dynamic code, external data handling, or network interactions are present.\n   - The classes are straightforward, serving as error representations in a web application context.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Code or Vulnerabilities**:\n   - The code is purely static class definitions with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.\n   - No external calls, data processing, or input handling that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n   - The import from `libs.exception` appears standard, assuming it is a trusted base class.\n\n3. **Supply Chain or Security Risks**:\n   - No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data, nor does it perform any network or file operations.\n   - The consistent pattern across all reports indicates a benign, standard approach to error handling.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, justified because the code does not introduce any security risk.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - Since the code is static and standard, there's no reason to adjust the scores upward.\n   - The reports' assessments are consistent and reasonable.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a typical, safe implementation of custom exception classes.\n   - No suspicious or malicious elements are present.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**My own estimate** aligns with the reports: the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exceptions.\n- No malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation detected.\n- Scores are justified as zero across malware, obfuscated, and risk metrics.\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is safe, with no supply chain or security concerns.",
