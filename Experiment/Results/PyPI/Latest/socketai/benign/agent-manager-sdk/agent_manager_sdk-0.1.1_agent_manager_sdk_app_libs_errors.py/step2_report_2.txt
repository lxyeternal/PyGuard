  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of static class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from a base exception class.\n   - There are no dynamic data handling, external calls, or data flows.\n   - No suspicious or malicious constructs are present.\n   - All reports agree that the code appears benign and standard for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying that the code is straightforward and safe.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The assessments correctly note the absence of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, aligning with the straightforward static class definitions.\n   - The `confidence` is 1 across all reports, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No issues are identified that warrant a higher risk score.\n   - The code is purely for error handling, with no signs of malicious intent.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain low or zero.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, correctly reflecting no malicious activity.\n   - The code does not perform any external calls, data processing, or dynamic execution.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on static analysis.\n   - No unwarranted security concerns are raised.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Evaluation & My Final Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is straightforward, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions for an application. It does not contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\nMaintain the current low scores. No further action or concern is necessary.",
