  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a web application.",
  "sources": "Static class attributes within each exception class, no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "N/A; classes only define static attributes, no data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, static, and standard for error definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static class definitions inheriting from a base exception class, with no dynamic code, external calls, or data processing. It is a typical pattern for error handling in web applications. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The static attributes define error codes and descriptions, which are standard and safe. The code does not handle untrusted input or perform any network or file operations. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. The analysis and scores are accurate; no further action is necessary.",
