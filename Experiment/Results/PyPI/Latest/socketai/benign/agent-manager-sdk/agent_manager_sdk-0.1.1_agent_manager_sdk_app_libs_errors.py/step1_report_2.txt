  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various user authentication and account management errors.",
  "sources": "None; the code consists solely of class definitions with static attributes.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or data handling occurs within this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a base exception class and defines multiple custom exception classes, each with fixed error codes, descriptions, and HTTP status codes. All classes are straightforward and contain only static class attributes. There are no input sources, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no external network calls. The code appears to serve as an error handling module for an authentication system, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in an application. It shows no evidence of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is safe and serves a purely functional purpose.",
