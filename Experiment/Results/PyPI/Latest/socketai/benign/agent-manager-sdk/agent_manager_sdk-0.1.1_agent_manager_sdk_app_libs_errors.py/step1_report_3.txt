  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error conditions in a web application, extending a base HTTP exception.",
  "sources": "Import statement from libs.exception module.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly handles untrusted data or writes data to insecure locations.",
  "flows": "None; the code only defines exception classes and does not process runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected; the code consists solely of class definitions with static attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a base exception class and defines multiple subclasses, each representing specific error types with associated error codes, descriptions, and HTTP status codes. There are no dynamic elements, no input handling, no external data processing, and no suspicious behavior. The structure is straightforward, aimed at error handling in a web context. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines custom exception classes for error handling, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe and standard for web application error management.",
