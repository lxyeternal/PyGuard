  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios related to user account management and provider requests.",
  "sources": "Importing exception base class from libs.exception",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing, no external calls, no data leaks, and no sensitive information handling present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed. Exception classes straightforwardly extend a base class and define static error details.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exceptions inheriting from a base exception class, each representing specific error conditions. All attributes are static strings or integers, with no dynamic execution, external calls, or data handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of custom exception definitions for application error handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
