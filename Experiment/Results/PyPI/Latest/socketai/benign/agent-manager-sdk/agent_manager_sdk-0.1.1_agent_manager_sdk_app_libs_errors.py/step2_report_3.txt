  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from `BaseHTTPException`.\n   - Each class has static attributes: `error_code`, `description`, and `code`.\n   - No dynamic code, data processing, external calls, or data handling are present.\n   - The code is straightforward, serving as an error handling module for a web application.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code appears benign and purely functional.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, external data processing, or suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Assessment of Risks and Scores:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity or code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or attack vectors identified.\n   \n   These scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Concerns:**\n   - The only minor consideration is whether static exception classes with fixed error codes and descriptions could be misused, but this is standard practice and not inherently risky.\n   - The reports correctly identify that this code is purely defining error classes with no malicious intent.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The reports' assessments are accurate.\n   - The code is safe, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security vulnerabilities or attack vectors.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and consistent. No changes needed.",
