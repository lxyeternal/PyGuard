  "purpose": "Read environment variables from a file and convert each line into a structured dictionary format.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'secret.env' file line by line.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; data is processed in-memory and printed.",
  "flows": "File read -> lines processed -> string split into key-value -> dictionary created -> printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials beyond reading from an environment file; no malicious code, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads 'secret.env' line by line, filters out empty lines, then splits each line on '=' to extract keys and values. It sanitizes the strings by removing newlines and quotes, then constructs dictionaries with 'name', 'value', and 'slotSetting' set to 'false'. It prints each line and then prints each generated dictionary. There are no external data transmissions, no use of untrusted inputs beyond local file reading, and no suspicious code patterns. The purpose appears to be transforming environment variable definitions into a specific JSON-like structure. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The script simply processes a local environment variable file into structured data, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be a benign utility script.",
