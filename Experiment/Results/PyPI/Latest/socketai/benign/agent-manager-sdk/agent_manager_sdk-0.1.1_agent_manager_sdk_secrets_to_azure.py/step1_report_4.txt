  "purpose": "Read and parse environment variable definitions from a file, then format and output them as JSON objects.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'secret.env' file using open() and readlines() method.",
  "sinks": "Printing lines and key-value pairs to standard output.",
  "flows": "File read -> data stored in 'f' -> parsing lines -> appending formatted objects to 'keys' -> printing keys.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; the code is straightforward. The only unusual aspect is that it reads from a fixed filename 'secret.env', which could potentially contain sensitive info, but this alone is not malicious. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script opens a file named 'secret.env' for reading, filters out empty or very short lines, then splits each line at '=' to extract key-value pairs. It constructs a list of dictionaries with specific formatting and prints both raw lines and the formatted dictionaries. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be for environment variable management or configuration extraction, which is common. The only potential concern is reliance on a local file containing secrets, but that alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple reading and formatting of environment variables from a file. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard utility code for managing secrets or configuration data.",
