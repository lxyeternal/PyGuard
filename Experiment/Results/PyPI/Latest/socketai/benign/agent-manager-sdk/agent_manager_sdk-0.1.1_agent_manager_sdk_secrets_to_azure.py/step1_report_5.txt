  "purpose": "Read environment variable data from 'secret.env' file and transform each line into a dictionary with specific keys and values.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'secret.env' file line by line, specifically at the 'with open' statement and the 'for line in f' loop.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to write to or send data to external systems or untrusted sources; it only processes and prints data locally.",
  "flows": "Source: Reading lines from 'secret.env'; Transformation: Splitting lines into key-value pairs; Output: Printing the parsed key-value dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "The code reads from a file named 'secret.env' which may contain sensitive credentials. It prints lines and parsed keys, potentially exposing secrets in logs or console output. The 'slotSetting' is hardcoded as string 'false' instead of boolean false, but this is not inherently malicious. No use of untrusted input in unsafe operations or external network connections is present.",
  "analysis": "The script opens 'secret.env' and processes its content to extract key-value pairs. It filters out empty or very short lines, then splits each line by '='. It constructs dictionaries with 'name', 'value', and 'slotSetting' fields. It prints lines and each parsed key, which could potentially leak sensitive information if logs are exposed. There are no signs of code injection, malicious code, or external data exfiltration. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data theft mechanisms are evident. The script's primary concern is handling sensitive data locally and possibly exposing it via prints.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for local processing of environment variable data, with no evident malicious intent. The main security concern is the potential exposure of sensitive secrets through printed output. No malware behavior or security risks are detected based on this code snippet.",
