  "purpose": "Process environment variable definitions from 'secret.env' into structured dictionaries with 'name', 'value', and 'slotSetting' fields.",
  "sources": "Reading from the local file 'secret.env' line by line.",
  "sinks": "Printing lines and constructed dictionaries to standard output.",
  "flows": "Read lines from file -> filter non-empty lines -> split each line on '=' -> sanitize strings -> append structured dict to list -> print lines and dicts.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code; straightforward processing. The only potential concern is printing sensitive data, which could lead to leakage if logs are exposed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a local environment file, filters out empty lines, splits each line into key-value pairs, sanitizes strings, and constructs dictionaries with a fixed 'slotSetting'. It then prints each line and each dictionary. No malicious behavior, external communication, or obfuscation is present. The main security consideration is the printing of secrets, which could leak sensitive data if logs are insecure. The code is simple, correct, and benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the behavior, reflecting a low security risk primarily due to potential secret leakage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for processing environment variables into structured data. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The only minor security concern is the exposure of secrets via print statements, which is a common logging risk but not malicious. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
