  "purpose": "Initialize a Flask web application with database, Celery, CORS, and environment-based configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables loaded from 'secret.env', configuration settings for Redis and database, and standard Flask setup functions.",
  "sinks": "Configuration of Redis broker/backend, database URI, and Flask blueprints; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read during app creation; used to configure Redis URLs and database URI; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Minor typo in a commented line does not impact functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Flask application setup, loading environment variables for configuration, initializing database and Celery extensions, registering blueprints, and setting up CORS. No malicious or suspicious patterns, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The environment variables are used appropriately, and the code structure follows standard practices. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 or lower) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities is found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Flask application initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
