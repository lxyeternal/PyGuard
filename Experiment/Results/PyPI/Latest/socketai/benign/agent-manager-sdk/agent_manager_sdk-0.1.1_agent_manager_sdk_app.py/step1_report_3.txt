  "purpose": "This code initializes a Flask web application with database, Celery, CORS, and blueprint registration for a DnD game backend.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (REDIS_HOST, REDIS_PORT), dotenv file ('secret.env'), user inputs via environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Redis connection strings, database URI, environment variables, Flask app configuration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → app configuration (Redis, database), Flask routes → blueprints and extensions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code patterns. The dotenv file 'secret.env' could contain secrets, but this is standard practice. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard initialization procedures for a Flask app, including loading environment variables from 'secret.env', configuring database and Redis connections, setting up CORS, registering blueprints, and initializing extensions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration code. No insecure practices or code injections are evident. Usage of environment variables for sensitive info is appropriate. The code is straightforward and adheres to common patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Flask-based backend application, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on environment variables for configuration, which is standard. There are no malicious behaviors or suspicious anomalies detected.",
