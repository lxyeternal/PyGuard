  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The code performs standard app setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a factory function, creates a Flask app instance, and retrieves a Celery extension object from the app's extensions dictionary. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows. It appears to be a typical setup for a Flask application with Celery integration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward application initialization code with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It is standard for Flask-Celery integration.",
