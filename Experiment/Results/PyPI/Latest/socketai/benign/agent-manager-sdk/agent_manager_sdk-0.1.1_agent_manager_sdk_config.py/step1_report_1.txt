  "purpose": "Load environment variables from a file for configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via os.getenv('WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT') after loading dotenv file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leakage or execution of untrusted data; the code only reads environment variables.",
  "flows": "The dotenv file is loaded, and then environment variables are accessed for configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious behavior, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports dotenv to load environment variables from a file named 'secret.env'. It then defines a Config class with a class variable that retrieves 'WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT' from the environment. The process is straightforward and standard for configuration management, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The environment variable is not used insecurely, nor does the code perform any dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration loader with no malicious intent or security risks. It securely reads configuration data from environment variables after loading from a file, with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
