  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms that the code is a straightforward environment variable loader with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate; no security issues.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is standard, with no signs of malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard configuration management.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **SecurityRisk score:** 0.1 — slightly above zero, implying minimal risk, possibly due to the use of environment variables which could be misused if handled insecurely elsewhere.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code itself is safe; the small security risk score reflects potential misuse downstream, not in this snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.1 — consistent, considering environmental variable handling.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes that 'WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT' could be used insecurely elsewhere but notes that the snippet itself is safe.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.1 — consistent with the potential for insecure use downstream.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code itself is safe; potential issues depend on how 'WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT' is used later.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, no malicious behavior or anomalies.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0 — the code is safe.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0.1 in some reports, reflecting minimal potential risk if environment variables are misused later, but not a direct security flaw in this snippet.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No modifications are necessary based on the code review.\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a standard configuration loader with no malicious intent.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — acknowledging that environment variables could be misused downstream, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns well with the code's behavior.",
