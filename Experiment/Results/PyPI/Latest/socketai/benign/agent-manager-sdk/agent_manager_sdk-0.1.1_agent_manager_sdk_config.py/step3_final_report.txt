  "purpose": "Load environment variables from 'secret.env' and access 'WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT' for configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "dotenv.load_dotenv() reads from 'secret.env'; os.getenv('WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT') retrieves the environment variable.",
  "sinks": "The environment variable 'WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT' could be used insecurely downstream if mishandled, but within this code, no sink is present.",
  "flows": "load_dotenv() loads variables into environment; os.getenv() retrieves 'WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT' for use in the Config class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports dotenv and os, loads environment variables from a file, and defines a Config class with a class variable set via os.getenv. It follows best practices for configuration management without any obfuscation or malicious behavior. No suspicious logic, data leaks, or security flaws are present within this snippet. The environment variable 'WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT' is retrieved securely after loading, with no signs of tampering or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign configuration loader with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
