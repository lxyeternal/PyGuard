  "purpose": "Load environment variables from a file and define configuration parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via os.getenv after loading dotenv from 'secret.env'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; environment variables are used for configuration but not directly exposed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "dotenv.load_dotenv() loads variables from 'secret.env', which are then accessed via os.getenv('WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT').",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets; the code is straightforward. No suspicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables from a file named 'secret.env' using dotenv. It then defines a Config class with a variable that retrieves the 'WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT' environment variable. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. Usage of dotenv and environment variables is standard practice for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration loader that reads a potentially sensitive environment variable. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
