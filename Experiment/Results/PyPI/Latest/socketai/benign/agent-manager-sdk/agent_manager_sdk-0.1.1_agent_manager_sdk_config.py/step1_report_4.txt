{
  "purpose": "Load environment variables from a file and set a configuration variable for use in an application.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the file 'secret.env' via load_dotenv, and retrieves 'WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT' from environment variables using os.getenv.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable if 'WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT' contains untrusted input that is used insecurely elsewhere; no direct sink is present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "load_dotenv loads variables from 'secret.env' into environment; os.getenv retrieves 'WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT' for application use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code appears to be a standard environment configuration setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports dotenv to load environment variables from a specified file, which is a common and safe practice for configuration management. It then defines a class with a variable that is set from an environment variable. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, code obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The only potential concern is if 'WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT' is used insecurely elsewhere, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward environment configuration setup with no signs of malicious intent or security issues within this code snippet.",
