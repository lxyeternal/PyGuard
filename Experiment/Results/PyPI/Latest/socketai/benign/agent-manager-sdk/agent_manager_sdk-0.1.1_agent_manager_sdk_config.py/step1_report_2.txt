  "purpose": "Load environment variables from a file and define a configuration class with a workflow endpoint.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT' using os.getenv after loading dotenv file.",
  "sinks": "The 'WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT' value can potentially be used elsewhere in the application, but no direct sink is shown in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "dotenv file 'secret.env' is loaded, which may set environment variables. The variable 'WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT' is retrieved via os.getenv for use in the application.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. Usage of dotenv for environment management is standard. No malicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables from a specified file, then defines a class with a configuration variable that retrieves an environment variable. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malware signals are present. No unsafe code or malicious side-effects are evident. The code appears to serve a typical configuration purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration loader with environment variables, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and typical for application configuration management.",
