{
  "purpose": "Load environment variables from a specified .env file and define a configuration class with a variable.",
  "sources": "The dotenv.load_dotenv() function reads the 'secret.env' file; os.getenv() retrieves the 'WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT' environment variable.",
  "sinks": "The retrieved environment variable 'WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT' could potentially be used in network requests or other sensitive operations, but the code itself does not directly invoke such actions.",
  "flows": "The code loads data from 'secret.env' into environment variables, then assigns 'WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT' to a class attribute, with no further data flow shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The use of dotenv for environment variable management is standard. No obfuscated or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables from a file named 'secret.env' using load_dotenv, then defines a class with a class variable that pulls 'WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT' from the environment. This is a typical configuration pattern. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code execution is present. The code simply manages configuration data securely through environment variables.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for managing environment variables securely. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this snippet.",
