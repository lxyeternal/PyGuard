  "purpose": "Decorator function to enforce user account initialization check before executing a view function in a Flask application.",
  "sources": "Reading current_user object from flask_login, checking account.status property.",
  "sinks": "Raising an exception (AccountNotInitializedError) if account is uninitialized; calling the original view function.",
  "flows": "Input from current_user (source) flows through the check on account.status, potentially raising an exception (sink) or proceeding to call the view.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution. The code appears straightforward and typical for Flask security enforcement.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator to ensure a user's account is initialized before allowing access to a Flask view. It accesses current_user to get user info, checks if the user's status is 'uninitialized', and raises a custom exception if so. The flow is standard for access control. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or hidden backdoors are evident. Usage of flask_login and raising a custom exception is normal practice. No data leakage or insecure code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Flask decorator for access control based on user account status. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply enforces a user state check before executing view logic.",
