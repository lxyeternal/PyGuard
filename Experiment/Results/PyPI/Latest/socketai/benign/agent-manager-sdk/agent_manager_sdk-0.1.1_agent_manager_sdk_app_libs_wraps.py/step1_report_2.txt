  "purpose": "Decorator function to enforce account initialization requirement before executing a Flask view.",
  "sources": "Reading current_user from flask_login, checking account.status property.",
  "sinks": "Potentially raising custom exception (AccountNotInitializedError).",
  "flows": "current_user → account_initialization_required decorator → account.status check → possibly raise exception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code, no external data leaks. Uses standard Flask login mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator that checks if the current user's account is initialized by inspecting the 'status' attribute. It raises a custom exception if the account is uninitialized. All used libraries are standard for Flask applications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The flow is straightforward and intended for access control.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a simple access control check for account initialization status. No malicious activity or suspicious code behavior detected. It appears to be a standard, benign security pattern.",
