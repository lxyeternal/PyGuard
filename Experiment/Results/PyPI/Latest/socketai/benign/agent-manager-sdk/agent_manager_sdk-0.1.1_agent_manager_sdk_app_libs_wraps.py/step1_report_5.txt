  "purpose": "Decorator to enforce account initialization check for Flask view functions",
  "sources": "Access to current_user object to determine account status",
  "sinks": "Potentially raises an exception if account is uninitialized",
  "flows": "current_user.status is checked, and if uninitialized, an exception is raised; otherwise, the view is called",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Flask decorator that checks if the current user's account is initialized by inspecting current_user.status. If the account is uninitialized, it raises a custom exception. The code relies on Flask-Login's current_user, which is a standard approach. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The code appears straightforward, serving a typical authorization purpose without any hidden or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Flask decorator for authorization checks with no malicious intent or security issues identified. It functions as intended to prevent access to views when accounts are uninitialized.",
