  "purpose": "Decorator to ensure user account is initialized before executing a view function",
  "sources": "current_user from flask_login, which reads user session data",
  "sinks": "Accessing account.status and raising an exception if uninitialized",
  "flows": "current_user → account_initialization_required decorator → account.status check → potential exception raised",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed; simple control flow",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator that wraps a Flask view function, checking if the current user's account status is 'uninitialized'. It raises a custom exception if so. Usage of Flask-Login's current_user is standard for user session management. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The code relies on application-specific logic and standard libraries. Overall, the code appears straightforward and secure, serving a specific access control purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Flask decorator enforcing account initialization. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It primarily performs a status check and raises an exception if the account is not properly initialized. No security risks or malware indications present.",
