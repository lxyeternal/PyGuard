  "purpose": "A Flask decorator that enforces account initialization by checking if current_user.status equals 'uninitialized' and raises an exception if so.",
  "sources": "current_user object from flask_login, specifically the 'status' attribute",
  "sinks": "Raising AccountNotInitializedError when account.status == 'uninitialized'",
  "flows": "Input: current_user.status; Output: exception raised or view function executed",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward logic with no suspicious or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Flask decorator for access control, checking user account status before proceeding. It relies on flask_login's current_user, which is a common practice. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The logic is simple and appropriate for its purpose. The exception is raised only if the account is uninitialized, which is a typical pattern. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The code's clarity and standard approach support a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). The confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Flask decorator for enforcing account initialization. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are consistent with its straightforward and secure purpose.",
