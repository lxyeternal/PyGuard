{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports various components such as controllers, database extensions, and data models, and defines an export list for use in other parts of the application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: controllers, app_extensions.celery, app_extensions.db_ext, models.account, models.miniapps.dnd, models.workflow",
  "sinks": "None present; the code only imports modules and defines an export list.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or data sinks; the code simply organizes imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed. The code structure and content are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules related to controllers, database, task queue (celery), and data models. The import statements are standard, with no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior. The __all__ list exports functions and models for use elsewhere, indicating typical modular design. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with import statements and an export list. No malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security issues are evident. The code appears safe and benign.",
