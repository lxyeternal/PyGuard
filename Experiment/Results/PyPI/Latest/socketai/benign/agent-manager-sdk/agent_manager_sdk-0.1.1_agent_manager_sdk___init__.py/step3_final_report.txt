  "analysis": "The code is a static set of import statements and an __all__ list, typical for a Python package's __init__.py. It contains no dynamic code, user input handling, network activity, or data processing. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code's structure and content are straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All signals indicate a benign, well-structured package component. The scores should reflect no malware, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk.",
