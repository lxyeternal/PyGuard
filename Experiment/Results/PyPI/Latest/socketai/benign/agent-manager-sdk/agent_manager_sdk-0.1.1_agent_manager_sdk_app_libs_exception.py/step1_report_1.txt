{
  "purpose": "Define a custom HTTP exception class that extends Werkzeug's HTTPException, adding additional data attributes for error code and message.",
  "sources": "Import of 'Optional' from 'typing', import of 'HTTPException' from 'werkzeug.exceptions', class attributes, and the constructor initializing 'self.data'.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly interacts with untrusted data sources or outputs; the class simply initializes data attributes.",
  "flows": "The class's constructor initializes 'self.data' based on class attributes and description, with no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard library features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass 'BaseHTTPException' that extends Werkzeug's HTTPException. It introduces an 'error_code' attribute and an optional 'data' dictionary, which is populated during initialization with the error code, description message, and status code. There are no dynamic or external data interactions, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a simple extension of existing exception handling to include extra error information, which is common in web application development.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard extension of a web framework exception class to include additional error metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present.",
