{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class extending Werkzeug's HTTPException, adding error_code and data attributes for structured error reporting.",
  "sources": "The class reads the description and response parameters during initialization; self.data is populated with error_code, message, and status.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external outputs; self.data could potentially be exposed if the exception is caught and serialized externally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (description, response) flow into self.data during __init__, but no external data flows or dynamic code execution are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and standard for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code extends Werkzeug's HTTPException by adding an error_code attribute and initializing a data dictionary with error details. It involves no external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The class serves as a structured error reporting mechanism. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The implementation is simple, clear, and aligns with common patterns for custom exceptions in web frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and safe for use in web applications. It does not contain malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
