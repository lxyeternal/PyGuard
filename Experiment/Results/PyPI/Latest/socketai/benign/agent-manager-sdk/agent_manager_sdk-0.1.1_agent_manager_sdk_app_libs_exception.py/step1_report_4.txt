{
  "purpose": "Define a custom HTTP exception class that extends Werkzeug's HTTPException, adding structured error data.",
  "sources": "Initialization of self.data in the constructor, and inheritance from HTTPException which may set description and code.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of self.data if exposed externally, but no immediate sink of untrusted input is apparent.",
  "flows": "Constructor sets self.data based on class attributes and inherited description and code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, or hidden malicious constructs. The class only manages error data.",
  "analysis": "The code extends Werkzeug's HTTPException to create a custom exception with additional error metadata. It initializes self.data with standard error info, using class attributes and inherited description and code. No external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network activity are present. The structure and usage are standard for web applications handling errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard custom exception class implementation with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply enhances error information handling.",
