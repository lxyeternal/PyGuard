{
  "purpose": "Define a custom HTTP exception class inheriting from Werkzeug's HTTPException, adding an error code and data attributes.",
  "sources": "The class itself; the attributes 'error_code', 'data', and the parameters 'description' and 'response' passed to __init__.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sources or sensitive operations present.",
  "flows": "Initialization of 'self.data' using class attributes and constructor parameters; no external data flows or external inputs are processed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code follows standard class inheritance and data assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Werkzeug's HTTPException with additional attributes. The constructor initializes 'self.data' with internal attributes and parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to serve a purpose for structured error handling within a web application. No external inputs, network operations, or sensitive data handling are involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward extension of a standard exception class to include additional error metadata. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation appears safe and typical for web application error handling.",
