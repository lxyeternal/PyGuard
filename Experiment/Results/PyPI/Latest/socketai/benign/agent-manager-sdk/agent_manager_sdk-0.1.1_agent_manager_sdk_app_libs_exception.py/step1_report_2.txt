{
  "purpose": "Define a custom HTTP exception class inheriting from Werkzeug's HTTPException for standardized error handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'description' and 'response' in the constructor; class attributes 'error_code' and 'data'.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to self.data which constructs a dictionary based on class attributes and instance description.",
  "flows": "Constructor receives description, uses it to set self.data; no external data flows directly to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No suspicious or obfuscated code features.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a subclass of HTTPException with added attributes for error code and data. The constructor initializes self.data with relevant information, which could potentially be used for structured error responses. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious network activity. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward attribute setting suggests benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code defines a standard custom exception class intended for error handling. It appears benign with no malicious or suspicious elements detected.",
