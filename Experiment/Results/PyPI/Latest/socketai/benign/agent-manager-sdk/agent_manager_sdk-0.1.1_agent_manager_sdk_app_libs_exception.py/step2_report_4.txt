  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; it defines a subclass extending Werkzeug's HTTPException, adding error_code and data, which is initialized in __init__.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:** Security risk and malware are both 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies this as benign, standard code.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; it extends Werkzeug's HTTPException with additional attributes.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues identified.  \n- **Scores:** Security risk is 0.1, which might be slightly high for such straightforward code, but since no external data or dynamic behavior is involved, it could be considered overly cautious.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment of benign code is accurate.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code is consistent with the description; no anomalies.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, which is appropriate.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Matches the description; no suspicious elements.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Both 0, which is appropriate.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Consistent with the description; straightforward extension.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Both 0, fitting for benign code.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard extension of Werkzeug's HTTPException with added error metadata.  \n- **Malware score:** All are 0, which is justified; no malicious activity is present.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.  \n- **Security risk score:** All are 0 or very low, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's nature.  \n- No changes are necessary.  \n- The code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Risk:** 0 (standard exception extension with no external data or security implications)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, standard, and safe for use in web applications.",
