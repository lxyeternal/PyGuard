{
  "purpose": "Initialization of the asciidrawing package, exposing the 'greet' function from the core module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.core), which could potentially execute code during import.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file, or environment variable access are present.",
  "flows": "Importing 'greet' from '.core' could trigger code execution if the module has side effects, but no direct data flow is visible here.",
  "anomalies": "The file is minimal and straightforward; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement intended to expose functionality from a submodule. It does not contain any code execution, data processing, or suspicious activity. Since it only imports 'greet' from the local 'core' module, any malicious behavior would need to originate from that module, which is outside the scope of this file. No anomalies or malicious patterns are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization file with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply exposes a function from the core module.",
