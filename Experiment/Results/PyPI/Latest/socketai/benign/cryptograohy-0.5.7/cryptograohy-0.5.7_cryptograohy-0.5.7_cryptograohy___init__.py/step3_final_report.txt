  "purpose": "Package initialization, importing 'greet' from local module 'core'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .core module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external calls.",
  "flows": "Importing 'greet' from 'core' module; no data flow beyond module import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py that imports a function from a local module. It contains no data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution. The import is standard practice in Python packages. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The import could execute code if 'core' has side effects, but this is outside the scope of this file. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
