{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'cryptograohy', including a custom post-installation command that executes a CLI script.",
  "sources": "os.path.join() to locate 'cryptograohy/cli.py', subprocess.run() to execute the CLI script during installation",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() executing the CLI script, which may run arbitrary code depending on 'cli.py'",
  "flows": "PostInstallCommand.run() calls _run_post_install_script(), which executes the 'cli.py' script using subprocess.run()",
  "anomalies": "The code attempts to run 'cryptograohy/cli.py' immediately after installation, which could execute arbitrary code without user consent; no explicit validation or sandboxing is performed",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package with a custom install command that runs a script named 'cli.py' located in the 'cryptograohy' directory. The execution of this script occurs during the installation process via subprocess.run(), which can execute any code contained in 'cli.py'. The package name 'cryptograohy' appears to be misspelled but this does not impact security analysis. The use of subprocess to run an internal script during install can be a vector for malicious activity if 'cli.py' is compromised or maliciously altered. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious network activity is present. However, executing arbitrary scripts during install can be risky if the script contains malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself does not contain explicit malicious logic; however, the automatic execution of an internal script during installation is suspicious and could be exploited to run malicious code. The practice of executing arbitrary code during package installation warrants caution, especially if the source or integrity of 'cli.py' is unverified.",
