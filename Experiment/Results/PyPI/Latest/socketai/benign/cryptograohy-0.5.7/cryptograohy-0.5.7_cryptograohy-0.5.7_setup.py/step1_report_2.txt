{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with a custom post-installation script execution.",
  "sources": "The script reads the file path of 'cryptograohy/cli.py' during post-install, and runs it using subprocess.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the 'cli.py' script via subprocess, which could potentially execute malicious code if the file is compromised.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code constructs the path to 'cryptograohy/cli.py' and executes it with Python, executing any code within.",
  "anomalies": "The code attempts to run a script located in 'cryptograohy/cli.py' post-installation without validation or sandboxing. The filename 'cryptograohy' appears misspelled, possibly an obfuscation or typo, but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a package with a custom install command that runs a CLI script after installation. The script execution is straightforward but could pose security risks if 'cli.py' is malicious or has been tampered with, as it executes untrusted code at install time. The use of subprocess.run with 'python' and a constructed file path is typical but can be dangerous if the file is compromised. No obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The misspelling of 'cryptograohy' appears intentional or accidental but does not impact security directly.",
  "conclusion": "The package executes a post-install script located within its own directory, which could be exploited if the script is malicious. Otherwise, there are no clear signs of malicious intent or supply chain attacks. The main risk is the execution of potentially untrusted code during installation.",
