  "conclusion": "The setup script executes an internal script during installation without validation, posing a supply chain security risk. While no malicious code is explicitly present, the pattern of executing untrusted code during setup is inherently dangerous. The current low malware scores underestimate this risk; a malware score of approximately 0.6 and a security risk score of about 0.55-0.6 are more appropriate. The filename typo is likely benign but should be verified. Overall, the code pattern warrants caution, and further validation of 'cli.py' is recommended before trusting this package."
