  "purpose": "Execute a CLI function that imports the 'pyprettifier' library and creates an instance of 'EmojiConverter'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'pyprettifier' module upon execution and any exceptions during import or instantiation.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs exceptions to the console via print().",
  "flows": "Import 'pyprettifier' -> Instantiate 'EmojiConverter' -> Catch and print exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; standard exception handling. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple CLI function that attempts to import a third-party package 'pyprettifier' and instantiate a class 'EmojiConverter'. It catches any exceptions and prints the error message. There are no suspicious data flows, no code injection, no data leaks, and no malicious behavior observed. The code appears to serve a benign purpose related to emoji conversion functionality. No indications of malicious activity or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward CLI wrapper around the 'pyprettifier' library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard import and instantiation, with basic exception handling. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
