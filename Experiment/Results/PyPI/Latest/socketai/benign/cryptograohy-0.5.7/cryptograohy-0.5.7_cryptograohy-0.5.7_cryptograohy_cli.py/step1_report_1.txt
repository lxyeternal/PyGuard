{
  "purpose": "This code defines a command-line interface (CLI) function that attempts to import a third-party package 'pyprettifier' and instantiate an object from it.",
  "sources": "The code reads data during the import statement ('import pyprettifier') and when creating an instance ('pyprettifier.EmojiConverter()').",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is directly sent to external systems or outputs; the only output is an exception message printed to the console.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pyprettifier' -> instantiation of 'EmojiConverter' -> exception handling that prints errors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import the 'pyprettifier' package and instantiate an 'EmojiConverter' object. If an exception occurs during import or instantiation, it is caught and printed. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, malicious actions, or obfuscation. The code does not perform any network activity or system modification. The only potential concern is that it may silently fail if 'pyprettifier' is malicious or compromised, but this is typical in dynamic import handling. Overall, the code appears benign with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI setup that handles import errors gracefully. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and typical for a CLI utility that depends on an external library.",
