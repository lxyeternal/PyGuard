  "purpose": "The code attempts to import the 'pyprettifier' package and instantiate an 'EmojiConverter' object, serving as a CLI utility with exception handling.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'pyprettifier' and instantiation of 'EmojiConverter()'",
  "sinks": "Printing exceptions to standard output",
  "flows": "Import of 'pyprettifier' -> instantiation of 'EmojiConverter()' -> exception handling and printing",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports a third-party package and creates an object, with exception handling that outputs errors. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or network activity are present. The exception handling is standard, and the code does not perform any suspicious operations. The reliance on an external package is a potential risk if the package is malicious, but this is outside static code analysis scope. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and reflect minimal security concern, primarily due to dependency trustworthiness.",
