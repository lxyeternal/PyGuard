  "purpose": "This script attempts to import the 'pyprettifier' package and instantiate an 'EmojiConverter' object, likely for converting text to emojis or similar functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads data during the import of 'pyprettifier' and the instantiation of 'EmojiConverter'. It also reads from standard output when printing exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Printing exceptions to standard output; no untrusted data output or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Code flow begins with import, proceeds to object instantiation, and may lead to exception handling output. No external data flows or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "anomalies": "The code's structure is minimal, with a straightforward import and exception print. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a third-party library and create an object from it. The exception handling is generic and only outputs error messages. There is no malicious behavior or suspicious activity observed. The code is simple and appears to serve a utility function, likely related to emoji conversion, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a basic import and object creation with exception handling. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident.",
