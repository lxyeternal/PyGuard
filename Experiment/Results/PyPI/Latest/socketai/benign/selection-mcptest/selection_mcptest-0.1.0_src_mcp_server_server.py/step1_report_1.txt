{
  "purpose": "The code implements a server providing weather and geocoding services via the MCP protocol, querying Baidu APIs.",
  "sources": "Environment variable BAIDU_API_KEY for API key; user-provided parameters 'district_id' and 'address' via function calls.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to Baidu API endpoints, returning JSON responses; potential data exposure if response data contains sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('district_id', 'address') flow into API request parameters; responses from Baidu API flow back as JSON data encapsulated with status and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable for API key is standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed. No obfuscated code present. No suspicious dynamic code execution, no data exfiltration or malicious network activity evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a weather and geocoding server using Baidu APIs, encapsulated within MCP tools. It properly handles exceptions, uses environment variables for sensitive data, and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. No anomalies or malicious patterns such as backdoors, data leaks, or malicious network activity are detected. The code structure is standard, with clear separation of functions, and only interacts with official Baidu APIs via HTTP requests. No signs of supply chain attacks or malware are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, functioning as an MCP-based weather and geocoding service querying Baidu APIs without malicious intent or security risks. No malware, suspicious anomalies, or obfuscation detected.",
