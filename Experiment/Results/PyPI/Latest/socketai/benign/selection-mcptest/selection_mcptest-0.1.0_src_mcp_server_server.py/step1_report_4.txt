  "purpose": "This code provides a simple MCP server with tools for weather querying and geocoding using Baidu APIs, including environment variable configuration and server startup routines.",
  "sources": [
    "Environment variable 'BAIDU_API_KEY' via os.getenv()",
    "Function parameters 'district_id' and 'address'",
    "HTTP request responses from Baidu API endpoints"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "Returning API response data in the tool functions",
    "Raising exceptions that include error messages",
    "Printing server status and errors to stdout/stderr"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Input parameters (district_id, address) → API request → API response → return data or raise errors",
    "API response status/error → exception handling → error message propagation"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of environment variable 'BAIDU_API_KEY' without fallback or validation",
    "No input validation or sanitization for parameters 'district_id' and 'address'",
    "Error messages include potentially sensitive info in exceptions",
    "No hardcoded credentials aside from environment variable, which is standard",
    "Use of print statements for server logs, but no suspicious code patterns observed"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code sets up a MCP server exposing two tools: weather querying and geocoding, both interfacing with Baidu APIs. It retrieves API key from environment variables, constructs requests, and handles responses with error checks. Exception handling converts errors into ValueError with messages, and the server runs with standard MCP 'stdio' transport, requiring a local client. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious network behavior detected. The data flow is straightforward, and no suspicious logic or hardcoded secrets are present. The environment variable usage appears standard, and the print statements are for logging. Overall, the code seems benign and designed for legitimate API interfacing.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a straightforward MCP server exposing weather and geocoding services via Baidu APIs. No malicious activity, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The only potential concern is the reliance on an environment variable for API key, which is a standard practice. The code operates securely within its intended scope and does not exhibit any signs of supply chain or malicious intent.",
