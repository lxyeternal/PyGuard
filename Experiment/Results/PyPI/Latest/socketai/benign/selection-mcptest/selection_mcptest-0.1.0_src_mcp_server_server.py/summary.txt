  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation of an MCP server interfacing with Baidu APIs for weather and geocoding services. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The security risk score is low (~0.2), primarily due to external API dependency and environment variable handling. Overall, it is safe and suitable for use."
