{
  "purpose": "Provides weather data retrieval and geocoding services via Baidu APIs within an MCP server framework.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'BAIDU_API_KEY'; receives 'district_id' and 'address' parameters; makes HTTP GET requests to Baidu API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "HTTP responses from Baidu APIs; returns structured data including raw API responses; potential error messages.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('district_id', 'address') -> API request to Baidu endpoints -> Response handling -> Return data structure with status, data, metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior; no hardcoded secrets; code is straightforward; no obfuscation; standard exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements an MCP server exposing two tools: weather querying and geocoding. It uses environment variables for API keys, makes asynchronous HTTP requests, and handles responses properly. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are detected. Error handling propagates exceptions with informative messages. The code is clear, with minimal risks, and follows standard practices. Input validation is minimal but acceptable for this context. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation of an MCP server interfacing with Baidu APIs for weather and geocoding services. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The security risk score is low (~0.2), primarily due to external API dependency and environment variable handling. Overall, it is safe and suitable for use.",
