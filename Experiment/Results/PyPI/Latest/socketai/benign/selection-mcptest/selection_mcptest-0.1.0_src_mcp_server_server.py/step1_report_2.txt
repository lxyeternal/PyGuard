{
  "purpose": "This code provides a server implementation that offers weather querying and geocoding services via MCP protocol, interacting with Baidu APIs.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'BAIDU_API_KEY', input parameters 'district_id' and 'address' from function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses untrusted input parameters in HTTP request URLs and parameters to external APIs, potentially exposing request data or API responses.",
  "flows": "Input parameters from functions -> HTTP request to Baidu API -> Response handling and returning data in structured format.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; no hardcoded credentials aside from API URL and placeholder for API key, which is fetched from environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two asynchronous tools: one for weather data retrieval and another for geocoding, both interacting with Baidu APIs. It properly handles exceptions and API responses. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The use of environment variables for API key is standard practice. The server setup uses standard MCP library features with 'stdio' transport, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of weather and geocoding services using Baidu APIs. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks beyond normal API interaction. The design follows expected patterns and uses environment variables for sensitive data. Overall, it is a standard, non-malicious service implementation.",
