  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with no explicit indication of its purpose from the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and potentially from external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to console output, file systems, or network connections. Specific sinks depend on functions used.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (like environment variables or inputs) to sinks through functions or operations that process the data.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual or suspicious constructs apparent from the given snippet.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review shows standard coding practices without signs of malicious behavior. The code does not contain any evident backdoors, hidden network connections, or malicious system modifications. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate, and no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. Lack of context limits full certainty, but based on the provided code, there are no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malware or malicious intent based on the provided snippet. It is likely safe, but full verification would require additional context or code sections.",
