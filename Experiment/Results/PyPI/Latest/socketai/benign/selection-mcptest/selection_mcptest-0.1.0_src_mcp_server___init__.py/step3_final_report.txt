  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided summaries.",
  "sources": "General data processing, network communication, environment variables, user input, utility functions; no explicit code snippets provided.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs, network transmissions, environment variables, file operations; no specific untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks are implied but not explicitly detailed; generally from inputs to outputs without suspicious pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, eval()/exec(), or suspicious patterns detected; code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently identify no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. Confidence levels vary from 0.4 to 0.9, reflecting the limited code context. Malware scores are uniformly zero, justified by the absence of malicious indicators. Risk scores are low (~0.2), indicating minimal concern but acknowledging some uncertainty due to limited details. The reasoning across reports is sound, and scores are aligned with their assessments.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the summaries, the code is benign with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or high security risks. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further adjustments are necessary.",
