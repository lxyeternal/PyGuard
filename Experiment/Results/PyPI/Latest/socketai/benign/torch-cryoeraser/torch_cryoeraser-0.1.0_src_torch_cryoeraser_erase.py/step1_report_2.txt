{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to inpaint (erase) regions in images using Gaussian noise based on local background statistics.",
  "sources": "Input tensors: 'image' and 'mask' from function parameters; external functions 'estimate_local_mean' and 'estimate_background_std' imported from 'torch_cryoeraser'.",
  "sinks": "Generated noise with np.random.normal; modifications to 'inpainted_image' tensor. No untrusted external data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Image and mask tensors are read as input; local mean and background std are estimated; foreground pixels are replaced with local mean plus Gaussian noise.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. Usage of external estimation functions is standard. Random noise is generated locally for inpainting.",
  "analysis": "The code processes image data for inpainting by masking foreground regions and replacing them with local mean plus Gaussian noise, estimated via external utility functions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity is present. External dependencies appear standard for image processing. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate image inpainting implementation that uses Gaussian noise to erase regions. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or malware indicators are evident.",
