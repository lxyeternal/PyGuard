{
  "purpose": "Test functions to verify the 'erase_region_2d' function runs correctly and produces output of expected shape.",
  "sources": "Generation of tensors 'image' and 'mask' as input data for 'erase_region_2d'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no data leaks, no network or file I/O operations.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are passed directly to 'erase_region_2d' without external data or untrusted sources; no data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite that creates tensors, invokes an external image inpainting function, and asserts output shape. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising code is present. The external function's implementation is not shown, but its usage appears standard. The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or write to files. All scores from the reports are zero or near-zero, aligning with the benign nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9-1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward test script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
