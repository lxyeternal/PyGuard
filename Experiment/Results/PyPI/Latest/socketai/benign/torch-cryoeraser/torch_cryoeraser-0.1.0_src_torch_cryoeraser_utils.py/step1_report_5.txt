{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for image processing, normalization, cropping, background estimation, and pixel count mapping, primarily for scientific or medical imaging analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are images and masks, which are expected to be provided as torch.Tensor objects, typically from external datasets or prior processing steps.",
  "sinks": "The code performs calculations on input tensors, but does not contain any explicit data leaks, external network connections, or system modifications. There are no apparent data exfiltration or malicious output mechanisms.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input tensors (images, masks) through normalization, cropping, background estimation, and pixel counting operations. No external or untrusted data is used in a way that leads to security vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes standard image processing functions; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code uses well-known libraries like numpy, torch, scipy, and einops, which are legitimate for scientific purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical image analysis functions: resampling factor calculation, normalization, cropping, background noise estimation, and pixel counting of labeled regions. All functions utilize standard tensor operations, scipy for labeling connected components, and numpy for array manipulations. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious data handling are observed. No external network calls or system modifications are evident. The functions seem purpose-built for scientific image analysis without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a collection of legitimate image processing utilities without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The overall security risk is very low.",
