{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for image processing and analysis, including normalization, cropping, background estimation, and pixel count mapping.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are primarily torch.Tensor objects representing images and masks; these are read via function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include calculations that could leak data if misused, such as std estimation and pixel counting, but no external data output or network communication is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input tensors through processing functions like cropping, normalization, and pixel counting, with no external network or file output; computations are internal.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses common libraries for scientific computing. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variables are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image processing tasks: calculating resampling factors, normalizing images, cropping, estimating background standard deviation, and creating pixel count maps. Functions operate on torch.Tensor objects, with no external system interactions, network calls, or data exfiltration. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data theft, or backdoors. Use of numpy and scipy for labeling and connected components is typical. No suspicious logic, and library usage is consistent with scientific Python standards.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of image processing utilities without any malicious intent. No malware or malicious behavior detected. Security risks are minimal; the code's purpose is legitimate for image analysis.",
