{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for image processing, normalization, cropping, background estimation, and pixel counting on 2D images using PyTorch and SciPy.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters: images, masks, and labels provided by the user or calling environment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could leak data or perform harmful actions; no network or file I/O is present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function arguments through processing functions; no untrusted data flow to external systems or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious functions are detected. Usage of libraries appears standard for scientific image processing.",
  "analysis": "The code contains typical image processing functions: normalization, cropping, background standard deviation estimation, and pixel counting. No code injections, external network calls, or suspicious logic are present. The pixel_count_map_2d function conditionally performs label analysis, which is a common technique, and uses numpy and scipy libraries appropriately. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate utility code for image analysis with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It is standard for scientific processing, with no suspicious data flows or security risks.",
