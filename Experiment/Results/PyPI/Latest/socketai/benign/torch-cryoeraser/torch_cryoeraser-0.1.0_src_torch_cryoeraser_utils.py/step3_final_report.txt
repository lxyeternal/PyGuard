  "purpose": "Utility functions for image normalization, cropping, background estimation, and pixel counting in scientific image analysis.",
  "sources": "Input tensors for images and masks, primarily from function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data flows; operations are confined within tensor manipulations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input tensors through processing functions without external interactions or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-structured, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image processing tasks using common scientific libraries. No network activity, file I/O, or dynamic code execution is present. The functions are logically correct, with minor performance considerations in pixel counting for large label counts, but these are not security issues. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code's purpose is benign, and its structure is clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of image processing utilities with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current security risk and malware scores are appropriate, though a slight reduction in the security risk score to 0.1 would better reflect its benign nature.",
