  "purpose": "Estimate local mean of an image using bivariate spline fitting on sampled foreground pixels, then evaluate over the entire image grid.",
  "sources": "Sampling foreground pixel indices from mask; reading image and mask tensors.",
  "sinks": "Evaluation of the spline model over the image grid; no external data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Sampled foreground pixel coordinates (y, x) -> spline fitting -> evaluation over grid (y, x).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; warnings suppressed during spline fitting, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code converts tensors to numpy, samples foreground pixels without seed (acceptable), fits a bivariate spline, suppresses warnings, evaluates the spline over the image, and converts back to tensor. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It performs a standard image background estimation task using scientific libraries. No external communication, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. The sampling and spline fitting are legitimate procedures. The suppression of warnings is typical in scientific code and does not indicate malicious intent. The code is clear, readable, and free of malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard image processing task with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The risk score could be conservatively set to 0, but 0.1-0.2 remains acceptable due to minor concerns like warnings suppression. Overall, the code is safe and the reports accurately reflect this.",
