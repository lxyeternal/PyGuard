  "purpose": "Define module metadata and expose the erase_region_2d function for cryo-EM image processing.",
  "sources": "Imports erase_region_2d from local module .erase",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up module metadata and imports a function",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or suspicious behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module, sets module metadata such as version, author, email, and exposes the function through __all__. It contains no data processing, network activity, or other behaviors that could indicate malicious intent. It appears to be a standard package __init__.py file establishing package information and exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup file with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It simply exposes a function for external use and contains no risky or suspicious code.",
