{
  "purpose": "This module sets package metadata (__version__, __author__, __email__) and exposes the function 'erase_region_2d' from the local '.erase' module for cryo-EM image processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports 'erase_region_2d' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only exposes a function.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply imports and exports a function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that defines metadata and imports a function from a local module. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The actual behavior and potential maliciousness depend on the implementation of 'erase_region_2d', which is not provided. The code is straightforward and standard for a package interface, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and standard for a Python package interface. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks in this snippet. The actual risk depends on the implementation of 'erase_region_2d', but based solely on this code, it is safe.",
