{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that provides functionality to erase masked regions from cryo-EM images, likely as part of a larger image processing package.",
  "sources": "The code imports the erase_region_2d function from a local module (.erase), which is a source of data processing. It also reads metadata such as version, author, and email information.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code does not perform network operations, file I/O, or execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The code imports a function from a local module and exposes it via __all__, with no dynamic code execution or data flow visible.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials (beyond author and email), or suspicious patterns. The metadata is standard. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module initialization script, defining version, author, and email metadata, and exposing a single function from a local module. It does not perform any input processing, network communication, or data manipulation. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior; the code appears to be a benign part of an image processing library.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward package component for cryo-EM image processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code is safe based on its structure and content.",
