{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define metadata and import a function for processing cryo-EM images, specifically to erase masked regions.",
  "sources": "The code imports the erase_region_2d function from a local module 'erase'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present in this fragment.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted input or output in this fragment; it's purely defining metadata and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it sets version, author info, and email, then imports a single function and exposes it via __all__. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or data manipulations present. The purpose is to provide an interface for the 'erase_region_2d' function. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent detected in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module primarily serving as an interface for image processing functionality. No malware or security risks are apparent based on this fragment.",
