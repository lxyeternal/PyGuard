  "purpose": "Import the ToExe class from a local module named 'toexe'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; import statement alone does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement with no additional logic, parameters, or dynamic features. No signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a class from a relative module, which is standard practice in Python projects. There are no apparent security risks, no hardcoded credentials, no malicious functions, or suspicious behaviors. Given its simplicity, the code does not perform any operations that could be malicious. No additional context is provided that might suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger project where 'ToExe' is used elsewhere.",
