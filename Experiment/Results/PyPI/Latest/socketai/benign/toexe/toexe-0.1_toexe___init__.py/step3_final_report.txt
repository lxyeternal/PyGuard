{
  "purpose": "Import the ToExe class from a local module, likely for executable conversion or related functionality.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external effects; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads the class into the namespace; no data flow beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; minimal and straightforward code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a local module, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The import is typical in modular Python projects and does not pose any security risk. The minimal nature of the code supports a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores should reflect zero malware, no obfuscation, and negligible security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
