  "purpose": "Import the 'ToExe' class or function from a local module named 'toexe'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module 'toexe' to import 'ToExe'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the import statement to any subsequent use of 'ToExe' (not shown here), but in this snippet, no further flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard, no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are evident. It only imports a local module.",
  "analysis": "This snippet is a simple import statement, indicating a modular code structure. It does not perform any operations, contain any data flows, or include suspicious code. The absence of additional context limits analysis, but based on this alone, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger, benign codebase.",
