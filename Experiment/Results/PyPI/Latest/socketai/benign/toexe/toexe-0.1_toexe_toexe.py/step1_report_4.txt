  "purpose": "The code automates the process of building a Python script into an executable using PyInstaller, including optional icon setting and post-build cleanup.",
  "sources": "User-supplied filename parameter, environment for checking 'pyinstaller' presence.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'pyinstaller' command via subprocess, file system operations (deletion, move, cleanup).",
  "flows": "Input filename and options -> constructs command -> executes subprocess -> moves and cleans up files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'shell=True' in subprocess.run() can be risky if filename is untrusted, but filename appears to be controlled. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The script verifies 'pyinstaller' installation, constructs a command to build an executable, executes it, and manages cleanup of build artifacts. No malicious code or backdoors are evident. The use of subprocess with shell=True is potentially risky if inputs are untrusted, but in typical usage with controlled filenames, this is acceptable. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a build automation tool for Python scripts, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs standard build and cleanup operations safely when used as intended.",
