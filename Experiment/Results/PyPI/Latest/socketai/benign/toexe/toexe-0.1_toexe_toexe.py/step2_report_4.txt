  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward wrapper around PyInstaller, with no malicious behavior detected. The main concern is the use of `shell=True`, but filename is not directly influenced by external input.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These seem reasonable given the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The low risk score is justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, but emphasizes the security risk due to `shell=True` and unvalidated filename input, which could lead to command injection if filename is malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.45. The higher risk score reflects the potential for command injection.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning aligns with best practices—`shell=True` can be risky if inputs are untrusted. Since filename is not validated, the risk is non-zero.\n- **Recommendation:** The risk score is reasonable; no change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, highlights the security concern with `shell=True` and lack of input validation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.4. Consistent with the potential for command injection.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected; the risk is primarily from insecure command execution.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—potential security issue with `shell=True` and unvalidated filename, but no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Slightly lower, possibly reflecting less emphasis on risk.\n- **Justification:** The risk is real but depends on input trustworthiness; scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, points out the security risk with `shell=True` and lack of validation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.4. Justified given the potential for exploitation if filenames are malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious code, but security best practices recommend avoiding `shell=True` or validating inputs.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.45, reflecting potential command injection risks due to `shell=True` and lack of input validation.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The use of `shell=True` in `subprocess.run()` is a security concern. It should be replaced with `shell=False` and passing arguments as a list to mitigate injection risks.\n- Validating or sanitizing filename inputs would further reduce risk.\n- The current scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2–0.45 depending on the level of concern about command injection. Given the consistent mention and potential for exploitation, a **risk score of around 0.4** is justified.\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard build automation script with a notable security concern regarding command execution.**",
