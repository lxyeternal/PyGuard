  "purpose": "The code automates the process of building a standalone executable from a Python script using PyInstaller, including cleanup of build artifacts.",
  "sources": "Input data is obtained from the filename parameter provided during class instantiation and environment paths checked via shutil.which.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the constructed command string via subprocess.run with shell=True, file and folder deletions, and file moves.",
  "flows": "The filename input influences command construction and file operations; the subprocess command potentially executes the build process, and cleanup functions manipulate files based on the build outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of shell=True in subprocess, which can lead to command injection if filename input is maliciously crafted; file deletions and moves are performed based on filenames, which could be manipulated. No explicit input validation is performed on filename, icon, or command inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code's main functionality is to check for PyInstaller installation, build an executable with specified options, and clean up build artifacts. The command string is constructed dynamically and executed with shell=True, posing a risk if filename or other inputs are maliciously controlled. The cleanup functions delete files and folders based on the filename and standard build directories. There are no evident hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The use of subprocess with shell=True is a notable security concern, especially if filename is untrusted. Overall, the script appears to be a straightforward automation tool with potential risk if inputs are not sanitized, primarily due to command execution method.",
  "conclusion": "This script automates building and cleaning up after a PyInstaller process. While no malicious code or backdoors are evident, the use of shell=True with unvalidated inputs introduces a security risk of command injection if the filename parameter is manipulated maliciously. It is recommended to avoid shell=True or validate inputs properly.",
