  "purpose": "The script automates the process of building a standalone executable from a Python script using PyInstaller, managing dependencies, and cleaning up build artifacts.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filename provided during class instantiation, checks for the presence of 'pyinstaller' using shutil.which, and executes a shell command to run PyInstaller with specified options.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run call executes a shell command which could be manipulated if inputs are untrusted, and file operations like os.remove and shutil.move modify files based on the filename and build process.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> checks for pyinstaller -> constructs shell command -> executes subprocess -> builds executable -> moves and cleans build files",
  "anomalies": "Use of shell=True in subprocess.run, which can be risky if filename is untrusted; no validation of filename or paths; no sanitization or input validation before executing commands or performing file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the presence of 'pyinstaller' and then constructs a command string to build an executable. It uses subprocess with shell=True, which can be dangerous if the filename input is not sanitized, potentially leading to command injection. After building, it manages build artifacts by moving and deleting files and directories. The code does not sanitize or validate the filename or paths, relying on the assumption that inputs are safe. The overall logic is straightforward and intended for build automation, with no evident malicious behavior or backdoors. However, the use of shell=True and direct file manipulation without input validation are security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily automates a build process with file cleanup, with no clear malicious intent. The main security concern is the use of shell=True with potentially untrusted input, which could be exploited for command injection. Overall, the code does not exhibit malware or malicious behavior but has some security risks related to command execution.",
