  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build automation script with no malicious behavior. The main security concern is the use of shell=True in subprocess.run() without input validation, which could lead to command injection if filename or icon parameters are maliciously crafted. No malware or obfuscation is present. The risk score should reflect the potential for command injection, estimated around 0.4, consistent with the provided reports. To improve security, avoid using shell=True or sanitize inputs thoroughly."
