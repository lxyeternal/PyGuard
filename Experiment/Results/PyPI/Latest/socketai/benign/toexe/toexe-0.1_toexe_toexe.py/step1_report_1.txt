{
  "purpose": "This code automates the process of building a Python executable using PyInstaller and manages the output files.",
  "sources": "Input filename from class instantiation, environment checks via shutil.which, and command execution through subprocess.run.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run executes the build command; shutil.move moves the generated executable; file deletions modify local files.",
  "flows": "Input filename → build command construction → subprocess.run executes command → moving/deleting files based on build output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of shell=True in subprocess.run poses potential risk if filename or commands are manipulated externally, but filename is not directly sanitized or influenced by user input within this code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily wraps PyInstaller execution and manages build artifacts. It checks for PyInstaller installation, constructs a build command, executes it, and then moves/deletes files related to the build process. The command construction is based on class attributes, not external user input, minimizing injection risks. The use of subprocess with shell=True can be risky if filename or other inputs are externally controlled, but in the given code, filename is an internal parameter. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. No obfuscation or malware-like behavior is detected. The script does not collect or transmit data. The file management actions are standard for build cleanup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward build automation script for PyInstaller with typical file operations. No malicious or suspicious behavior is identified. The main concern is the use of shell=True with potentially unvalidated inputs, but within the current context, it does not pose a malicious threat.",
