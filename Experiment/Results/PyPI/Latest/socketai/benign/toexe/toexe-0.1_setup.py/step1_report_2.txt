  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'toexe' Python package, facilitating installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Static strings in setup() parameters, find_packages() function call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data processing found.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or external data; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward setup configuration with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated parts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for package setup and uses 'find_packages()' to locate package modules. All parameters are static strings or empty lists, with no external data sources or dynamic code execution. The setup configuration appears standard and benign. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. No sensitive data, secrets, or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies without any harmful or malicious behavior.",
