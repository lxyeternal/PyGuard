  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python tool named 'toexe' that converts Python scripts into executable files.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the script's own constants and function calls, such as package name, version, author details, dependencies, and repository URL.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; it is a standard setup configuration.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the static input parameters (e.g., package name, author email, URL) into the setup process, with no untrusted input sources or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python package setup using setuptools. It specifies package metadata and requirements, with no dynamic code execution or external data fetching. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated elements are present.",
