  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no dynamic data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and uses common packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static parameters, no dynamic code, external data fetching, or obfuscation. It employs standard functions like find_packages() and static strings for metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. No logical errors or suspicious patterns are present. The code poses no security threat and aligns with best practices for package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
