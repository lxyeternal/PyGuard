      "conclusion": "The code is generally secure and free from malicious behavior or supply chain risks. The primary issues relate to deployment and access control practices, not malicious sabotage. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a moderate risk score of around 0.3 due to configuration and route protection concerns."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity or security risks. The dynamic versioning approach is unconventional but harmless. All signals indicate a safe, standard setup script suitable for release. The scores assigned in the original reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
