  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'my-cloud-devops-consulting', including versioning, author info, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Static package data, package metadata, and dependencies specified within setup()",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or user input identified; no network connections or external code execution observed",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; versioning uses current datetime, which is non-sensitive",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic versioning with datetime may cause unpredictable package versions, but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up package configuration using setuptools. It employs current datetime to generate a version string, which could be unusual but not malicious. No code injection, network communication, or access to sensitive data is present. All dependencies are standard Python packages. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns identified. The commented-out section does not affect execution. Overall, the script is a benign package setup script with a non-standard versioning approach.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration with dynamic versioning. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The use of datetime for versioning is unusual but not harmful or malicious.",
