  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity or security risks. The dynamic versioning approach is unconventional but harmless. All signals indicate a safe, standard setup script suitable for release. The scores assigned in the original reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
