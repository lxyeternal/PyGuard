  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script with dynamic versioning based on current datetime.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static package data files; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; no network activity or external data processing.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; static data and dynamic version string generated locally.",
  "anomalies": "Use of datetime.now() for versioning is unconventional but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with a dynamic version string generated from the current timestamp. It reads static files and includes package data without processing untrusted input. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The use of datetime for versioning is unusual but not harmful, and does not indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity or security risks. The dynamic versioning approach is unconventional but harmless. All signals indicate a safe, standard setup script suitable for release. The scores assigned in the original reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
