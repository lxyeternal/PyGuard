{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'my-cloud-devops-consulting', automating versioning and package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from 'README.md' for the long description and gathers package information using find_packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; all data sources are static or local files.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The only dynamic element is the version number generated from the current date and time, which is standard for timestamping and not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script configures package metadata for setuptools, with the version dynamically generated using datetime, which is common for automated versioning. All inputs (README.md, package data, dependencies) are static or controlled. No code execution from untrusted sources, no obfuscated code, no network activity, or suspicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with dynamic versioning based on current timestamp. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is very low.",
