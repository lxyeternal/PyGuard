{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'my-cloud-devops-consulting', automating versioning and specifying package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static strings for package metadata, dynamic timestamp for version, file read operation for README.md, and hardcoded dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "Reading 'README.md' into long_description, setting package data including static files, and defining dependencies for installation.",
  "flows": "Static strings and dependencies are passed directly to setup(), the README.md content flows into long_description, and the timestamp-generated version flows into package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic versioning with datetime might be unusual but is not malicious; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package. It employs standard practices, with the only notable aspect being dynamic version generation using the current datetime. All inputs and outputs are standard, with no indication of malicious intent or security issues. No untrusted data sources or sinks that could lead to security risks are present. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or system modifications. It solely configures package installation parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a normal, benign package setup configuration without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
