{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Flask web application with user authentication, contact form handling, video access, and email notifications, primarily for managing user data and interactions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user form submissions for login, registration, and contact forms; environment variables for SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI, EMAIL_USER, MONGO_PASSWORD, MONGO_USERNAME; and URL parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include database insertions (`insert_one()`), email sending functions (`send_email()`), rendering templates, and redirect/response outputs.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input from form data flows into database storage and email notifications; session data and form data are used to control access and actions; data from URL parameters is used in URL building and rendering.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain hardcoded credentials; environment variables are used for secrets; no suspicious obfuscated code; use of `print()` for debugging could reveal sensitive info in logs. The secret key is assigned from an imported variable, which is acceptable if securely managed. No malicious backdoors or code injections are evident.",
  "analysis": "The application handles user authentication securely with hashed passwords and session management. It stores user data in MongoDB and uses environment variables for sensitive info. Email notifications are sent on contact form submission, which could be exploited if the `send_email()` function is malicious or misused, but no implementation details are provided here. The code properly checks user authentication before granting access to private videos. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The only minor concern is the use of `print()` statements that could leak sensitive info during debugging. Overall, the code appears standard with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not demonstrate malicious intent or security vulnerabilities; it follows typical patterns for web applications with authentication, database interactions, and email notifications. No malicious behavior or sabotage indicators are detected.",
