  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform specific operations using imported libraries, possibly involving data processing or system interaction.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules, environment variables, and possibly user input or files.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with system resources, network connections, or external APIs, which could be points where untrusted data affects behavior.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or user input through processing functions, possibly reaching sinks such as network or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are immediately apparent. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party libraries, but without malicious or suspicious function calls. There is no evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or covert channels. Usage appears typical for a Python package that performs data processing or system interaction. No hidden backdoors or malicious payloads are detected. Without more specific context or runtime data, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems typical for a Python package intended for legitimate purposes. However, the assessment is limited by the absence of detailed code content.",
