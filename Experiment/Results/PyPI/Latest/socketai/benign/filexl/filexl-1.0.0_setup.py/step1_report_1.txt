{
  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for the 'filexl' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, dependencies, and entry point definitions from the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or sensitive data processing present.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows within the setup() function to package installation and execution routines.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs detected. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python CLI tool. It imports setuptools, specifies package info, dependencies, entry points for CLI, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity present. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious code injection. The dependencies (pandas, openpyxl) are common and benign. No hardcoded credentials or unusual code structures observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
