  "purpose": "This script lists files in a specified directory, filters by extension, detects duplicates, and exports the data to Excel files. It also allows extracting duplicates from existing Excel files.",
  "sources": "Input paths from command-line arguments, input Excel files for duplicate extraction, file system via os.walk.",
  "sinks": "Writing DataFrames to Excel files, printing to console, reading from files.",
  "flows": "Input path and extension filters are used to generate a DataFrame, which is then saved to Excel. Duplicate detection reads and writes Excel files, with optional extraction from existing files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code performs typical file listing, filtering, and Excel I/O. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or unusual variable usage. No network activity, reverse shells, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs file listing with optional case-insensitive extension filtering, duplicate detection, and Excel I/O. It includes functions for listing files, saving data, identifying duplicates, and extracting duplicates from existing files. All data handling and I/O appear standard and safe. No evidence of malicious behavior or malicious intent. The command-line interface allows flexible file processing but does not invoke or include external or suspicious operations beyond standard file and data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign file management utility for listing and deduplicating files, with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It handles data securely and performs typical operations without suspicious logic.",
