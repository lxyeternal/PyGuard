  "purpose": "This script lists files in a specified directory, filters by extensions, detects duplicates, and exports data to Excel files, with options to extract duplicate information from existing files.",
  "sources": "User-provided input via command-line arguments: --path, --name, --ext, --only-duplicates, --extract-duplicates-from, --out, --filename. File system access through os.walk, os.path.exists, pd.read_excel.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations with pandas to_excel, which writes data to user-specified Excel files. Reading from existing Excel files via pd.read_excel. No other output or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence file listing and filtering, which generate a DataFrame. DataFrame is written to Excel files, and duplicate detection reads from and writes to specified files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code. Usage of pandas for file handling is standard. The script includes comprehensive command-line options for file operations, which could be misused if operated maliciously but are typical for such tools. No external network connections or system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file listing, filtering, duplicate detection, and file I/O operations using os and pandas. It handles user input securely via argparse. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system compromise mechanisms, are present. All functions serve legitimate file management purposes. The only potential misuse could stem from the command-line options to manipulate files maliciously, but this falls within expected utility behavior. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security exploits identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate utility for file management and duplicate detection with no apparent malicious intent. It operates entirely within standard file I/O and data processing, with no network activity or malicious payloads. The code appears safe and free of malware or sabotage.",
