  "purpose": "A utility script for listing files in a directory, filtering by extensions, detecting duplicate filenames, and exporting data to Excel files. It also supports extracting duplicates from existing Excel files.",
  "sources": "Filesystem access via os.walk, reading Excel files via pandas.read_excel, command-line arguments for input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Writing to Excel files, console output messages.",
  "flows": "Filesystem data flows into pandas DataFrame, which is then exported to Excel; command-line inputs influence filtering and processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Usage of standard libraries for legitimate purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file listing, filtering, duplicate detection, and Excel export. It uses common libraries (os, pandas, argparse) with straightforward logic. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The command-line options could be misused to delete or manipulate files, but this is typical for utility scripts and not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior and pose minimal security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, legitimate file management utility with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The reports accurately reflect its safety profile, and the assigned scores are justified.",
