{
  "purpose": "The script lists files in a specified directory, filters by extensions, detects duplicates, and exports results to Excel files, including functionality to extract duplicates from existing Excel files.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include command-line arguments (directory path, extensions, filenames) and reading existing Excel files for duplicate extraction.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to Excel files, and some console output is generated; no network, system modification, or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "flows": "Input arguments (source) are used to list files and read Excel files; data flows into pandas DataFrames; then data is written to Excel files as output. Duplicate detection filters data from DataFrames, which are then exported.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials or secret keys are present. Functions for duplicate detection and file listing are straightforward. No obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs file system traversal, filtering, DataFrame manipulation, and file I/O operations for Excel files. The script allows filtering by extensions with case insensitivity, handling duplicates, and reading/writing Excel files. There are no network calls, code injection, or system modifications. The logic is standard and intended for file management. No signals of malicious intent, backdoors, or privacy violations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility script for file management, duplicate detection, and reporting, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely within the local filesystem and uses standard libraries without any suspicious patterns.",
