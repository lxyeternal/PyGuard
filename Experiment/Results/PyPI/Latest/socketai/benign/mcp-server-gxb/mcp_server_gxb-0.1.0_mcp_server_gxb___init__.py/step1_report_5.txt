  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading points are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified due to minimal code content.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and contains only comments, version string, and a brief description. No suspicious or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic description of an MCP server with no executable logic, input handling, or external data processing. It appears to be an incomplete or placeholder implementation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code fragment is a straightforward, non-malicious description of a simple server with no suspicious activity or security concerns identified.",
