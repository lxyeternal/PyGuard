  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or output operations observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; no execution path involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be a minimal server stub with only comments, version info, and no executable logic or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of a descriptive comment, a version string, and no functional code. There are no input sources, data processing, or output sinks present. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The code appears benign and incomplete, likely part of a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the given snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is a minimal, non-functional stub with no suspicious elements.",
