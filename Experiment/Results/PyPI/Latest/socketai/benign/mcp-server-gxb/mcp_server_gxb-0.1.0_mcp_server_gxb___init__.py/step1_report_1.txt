  "purpose": "A simple MCP server implementation providing basic time functionality.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that could lead to data leaks or effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink since no input/output operations are included.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a descriptive comment, version declaration, and a brief statement; no suspicious or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is minimal, consisting solely of a comment, a version string, and a brief description. There are no input handling, data processing, or external communications implemented. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks are evident. Given the simplicity, the code appears to serve as a placeholder or documentation for an MCP server example, with no active code to evaluate further.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It functions as a basic description or template without any executable logic or external interactions.",
