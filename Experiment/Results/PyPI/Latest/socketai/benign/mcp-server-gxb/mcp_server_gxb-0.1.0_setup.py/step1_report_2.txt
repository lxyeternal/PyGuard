  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'mcp-server-gxb' Python project.",
  "sources": "User-provided static data: package name, version, author info, description, long_description, url, classifiers, python_requires, install_requires, entry_points.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no data flow involving untrusted sources or user input, just package metadata.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code only defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script utilizing setuptools to configure package distribution. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. There are no dynamic code executions, no handling of external untrusted input, and no code injection points. The long_description contains markdown documentation, but this does not influence code execution or security. All dependencies are declared explicitly, and there are no hidden behaviors or obfuscated code. Overall, this appears to be a typical, benign setup script with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks detected.",
