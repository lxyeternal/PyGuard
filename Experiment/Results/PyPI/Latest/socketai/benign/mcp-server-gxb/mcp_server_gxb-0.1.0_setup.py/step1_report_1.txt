  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'mcp-server-gxb' that implements an MCP protocol time server.",
  "sources": "Read package metadata (name, version, author, description), package discovery via find_packages(), dependencies (install_requires), and entry point for console script.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or user input handling; the code mainly defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "N/A – The code does not process untrusted input or data flows; it merely defines package metadata and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. The description contains a JSON snippet but it is static documentation, not code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It uses setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. All elements are typical and do not exhibit malicious behavior. No code execution, network activity, or dynamic behavior is present. The embedded JSON in the long_description is part of the documentation and does not execute or interact with the system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for packaging a Python project with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply configures package metadata and dependencies.",
