  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration for 'mcp-server-gxb' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, dependencies, and entry points defined in setup(). No dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external outputs. The setup script only defines package info.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the long_description contains static markdown documentation with a JSON snippet, which is non-executable.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. The long_description includes markdown documentation with a JSON snippet, which is static and for documentation purposes only. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation is present. All dependencies are standard. The reports agree that there is no malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. The embedded JSON is documentation, not code, and does not pose a risk.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration script with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified. The code poses no security threat.",
