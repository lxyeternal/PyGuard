{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'mcp-server-gxb' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static data in the setup() call: package name, version, author info, description, dependencies, entry points.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or code execution; setup configuration is static and controlled.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration data; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic behavior observed. All data appears to be static and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. No user input handling, no network operations, and no dynamic code execution. The long description includes markdown documentation but no executable code. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors detected. The dependencies specified are common libraries, and the entry point is a straightforward console script. Overall, the script appears legitimate and standard for Python package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical package setup file with static data and standard dependencies.",
