  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'mcp-server-gxb' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, dependencies, and entry point definitions; no external data input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; setup script primarily for packaging and installation purposes.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; setup configuration is static and predetermined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code structures observed. The code is a standard setup script using setuptools.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup functions from setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, and console entry points. It includes a long description with markdown content, but this is static text. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The dependencies and code are typical for package distribution. The markdown description includes JSON configuration, but this appears to be documentation, not executable code. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code follows typical packaging conventions and contains no suspicious patterns or behaviors.",
