{
  "purpose": "Provides time-related services via MCP framework, including current time, formatted date, and timezone-specific time.",
  "sources": "Standard modules (`datetime`, `zoneinfo`), user input (`timezone` parameter).",
  "sinks": "Return of formatted time strings; no data exfiltration or external commands.",
  "flows": "User input `timezone` flows into `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo()`, with exception handling to prevent misuse.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python libraries to serve time data, handling user input safely with exception handling. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The only potential concern is the use of user input in `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo()`, but exception handling mitigates risks. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or supply chain vulnerabilities. The minimal risk stems from user input handling, which is properly managed. Overall, the security posture is very good.",
