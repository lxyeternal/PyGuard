  "purpose": "To provide a server that offers current time and timezone-based time information through a FastMCP framework.",
  "sources": [
    "Datetime module: reading current time (`datetime.datetime.now()`) and formatting strings",
    "Zoneinfo module: reading timezone parameter from resource function (`timezone: str`)"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "Timezone resource function: uses user-supplied `timezone` parameter to access `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(timezone)`"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Datetime functions: source (current time) flows to return statements without external data dependencies",
    "Timezone resource: user input `timezone` flows from function parameter to `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(timezone)` which is used to generate timezone-specific datetime"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of user-supplied `timezone` parameter directly in `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo()`, which could potentially lead to misuse or errors if invalid input is provided, but does not appear malicious",
    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present",
    "No obfuscated code or unusual language features"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code provides time-related services via a framework, with functions for current time and timezone-based time. The timezone resource function accepts a user input string for timezone, which is used directly in `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo()`. While this could cause errors if invalid input is provided, it is handled with a try-except block. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of the `zoneinfo` module with user input does not constitute malicious intent but could pose a security risk if untrusted input leads to errors or resource exhaustion, though this is minimal and standard practice. Overall, the code appears benign, serving time information with proper exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign time server implementation using the FastMCP framework. It processes user input for timezone in a controlled manner and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. The potential risk is limited to incorrect timezone input handling, which is mitigated by exception handling. No malware or malicious activities are evident.",
