  "purpose": "To implement an MCP server providing time-related resources and tools.",
  "sources": [
    "import datetime",
    "import zoneinfo",
    "mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP",
    "mcp.tool()",

    "zoneinfo.ZoneInfo()"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "None identified that directly lead to data leaks or malicious actions."
  ],
  "flows": [
    "User or external input (timezone string) -> timezone_resource() function -> zoneinfo.ZoneInfo() -> returns current time in specified timezone"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets.",
    "No use of eval, exec, or similar dynamic code execution.",
    "No suspicious external network calls or data exfiltration observed.",
    "Exception handling around zoneinfo suggests cautious design, no obfuscation."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code defines a server with time-based tools and resources, utilizing standard libraries (datetime, zoneinfo). It accepts user input for timezone in a controlled manner, with proper exception handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code is straightforward, functional, and does not contain obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign server module providing time services. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks based on the provided source. It is safe for use in time-related server functionalities.",
