{
  "purpose": "To serve as the main entry point for an MCP (possibly custom protocol) server, providing time-related resources and tools.",
  "sources": "Input is obtained through function parameters such as 'timezone' in 'timezone_resource', and via internal module imports. No external input streams are directly read outside function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Data is returned as strings; no dangerous sink such as system commands, file writes, or network transmissions are present. No untrusted data is sent to unsafe sinks.",
  "flows": "User provides 'timezone' parameter to 'timezone_resource'; function processes it with 'zoneinfo.ZoneInfo'. No other data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features present. The 'zoneinfo' import is conditional and used properly.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a server with functions to provide current time, formatted date, and timezone-aware time. Functions are decorated as tools or resources for the server, utilizing standard Python modules (datetime, zoneinfo). The 'timezone' parameter in 'timezone_resource' is used to obtain timezone info; error handling is implemented. No external commands, network transmissions, or suspicious activities are evident. The overall structure and code are straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign server implementation providing time services. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It uses standard libraries appropriately without suspicious logic.",
