  "purpose": "Initialize and run the MCP server for SMCPHUB.",
  "sources": "Importing the SmcphubServer class from the server module; creating an instance of SmcphubServer.",
  "sinks": "Calling the serve() method on the SmcphubServer instance, which likely starts network services or server operations.",
  "flows": "import statement -> instantiation of SmcphubServer -> calling serve() method -> running asyncio event loop.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code appears straightforward and standard for starting a server.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a server class, instantiates it, and runs its serve method asynchronously. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity within this snippet. The code is minimal and functional, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The serve() method's implementation (not provided) could contain risks, but based on this code alone, it appears normal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical server startup script with no evident malicious intent or security risks based solely on this snippet. It simply initializes and runs a server class.",
