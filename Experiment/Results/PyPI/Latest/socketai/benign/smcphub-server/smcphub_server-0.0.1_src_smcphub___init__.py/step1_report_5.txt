  "purpose": "Initialize and run the SmcphubServer asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Import from .server module, instantiation of SmcphubServer, asyncio.run()",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed",
  "flows": "Instantiation of SmcphubServer → asyncio.run(smcphubServer.serve())",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard server startup pattern, no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports a server class, creates an instance, and runs its serve() method asynchronously. No user input, external data, or sensitive info handling is visible. The server class implementation is not provided, so potential malicious behavior within it cannot be assessed, but the code itself is straightforward and does not contain malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple server startup script with no evident malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a standard pattern for launching a server, assuming the server class itself is trustworthy.",
