  "purpose": "Initialize and run an instance of the SmcphubServer, which appears to be a server component related to SMCPHUB.",
  "sources": "Import of SmcphubServer from a local module .server; instantiation of SmcphubServer; invocation of serve() method.",
  "sinks": "The serve() method of SmcphubServer (potential network or data handling).",
  "flows": "Instantiation of SmcphubServer → call to serve() method within asyncio.run()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns observed. The code is straightforward and uses standard asyncio pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, creates an instance, and runs an asynchronous serve method. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network anomalies, or code injection. The serve() method's internal behavior is unknown, but based on this fragment alone, it appears to be a typical server setup. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard server startup script with no evident malicious intent or security risks based on the provided code. The overall security risk is low, assuming the serve() method and server implementation are secure.",
