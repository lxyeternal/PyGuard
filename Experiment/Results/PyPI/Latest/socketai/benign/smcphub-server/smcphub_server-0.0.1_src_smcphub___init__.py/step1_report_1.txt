  "purpose": "To initialize and run an MCP server using the SmcphubServer class.",
  "sources": "Importing SmcphubServer from the local server module.",
  "sinks": "Calling the serve() method of SmcphubServer instance.",
  "flows": "Import -> Instantiate SmcphubServer -> Call serve() method -> Run asyncio event loop.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The import is local, which is normal for modular code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, instantiates it, and runs its serve() method within an asyncio event loop. No external data sources or untrusted input handling is visible. The code appears straightforward and typical for starting an asynchronous server. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple server launcher with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is standard boilerplate for running an asyncio-based server class.",
