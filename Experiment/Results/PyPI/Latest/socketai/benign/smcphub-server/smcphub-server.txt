      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured API client/server component that interacts with external services securely and transparently. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The only issue is a minor async bug that does not impact security. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to external API dependencies and environment variable usage. Overall, the code appears secure and free of malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, minimal entry point delegating execution to an external package function. No issues or malicious activity are evident within this snippet. The security risk is low, contingent on the trustworthiness of 'smcphub'. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0, and the overall risk score should remain low (around 0.1). Further review of 'smcphub.main()' is recommended for comprehensive security assessment."
