  "sinks": "Calling 'main()' function from the imported module.",
  "flows": "Import from 'smcphub' -> execution of 'main()' function.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal, straightforward, and lacks inline secrets or unusual constructs. No suspicious code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'main' function from the 'smcphub' package and executes it. This is a typical entry point pattern. Since the content of 'smcphub.main' is unknown, the code itself does not contain any malicious behavior or obfuscation. It does not process input directly or handle data within this snippet. The overall structure is standard and simple, with no anomalies, secrets, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code acts as a simple entry point executing the main function of the 'smcphub' package. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this snippet alone.",
