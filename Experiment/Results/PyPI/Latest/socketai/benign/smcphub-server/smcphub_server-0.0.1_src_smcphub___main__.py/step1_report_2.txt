  "purpose": "To invoke the main function from the smcphub module when executed as the main program.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'main' from the 'smcphub' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code only calls a function from an imported module.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'main' from 'smcphub' and then calls main(). Data flow depends entirely on the behavior of 'smcphub.main()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected in this minimal script.",
  "analysis": "The script simply imports a function and executes it. There is no embedded logic, data processing, or input/output handling. The security and behavior depend entirely on 'smcphub.main()'. The code itself is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard entry point that delegates execution to 'smcphub.main()'. There are no apparent malicious behaviors or security issues within this fragment. Security risk and malware likelihood are very low, assuming 'smcphub.main()' is legitimate.",
