{
  "purpose": "This code handles command-line interface interactions for generating log reports based on specified report types and input files.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) for options and file paths.",
  "sinks": "Outputs error messages, help text, or report views to the output file (print to output_file).",
  "flows": "Reads sys.argv to determine report type and input paths, then invokes generate_report with paths, outputs results or errors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code. Uses sys.argv directly for control flow, which is typical for CLI tools but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly manages CLI arguments, validates inputs, and orchestrates report generation via dependency injection. It performs no network access, file modifications, or data exfiltration. All input validation is standard. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It does include sys.exit calls on errors, which is normal for CLI apps but can terminate unexpectedly if misused. No hidden or backdoor behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a CLI interface for report generation and does not contain malicious code or supply chain sabotage elements. It operates as expected for a command-line utility, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
