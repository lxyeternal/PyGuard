  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for log report generation, parsing command-line arguments, validating input files, retrieving report generators via dependency injection, and outputting reports.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, Path objects for input files",
  "sinks": "stdout for report output, sys.exit() for error handling",
  "flows": "Argument parsing → validation → dependency injection → report generation → output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface that handles argument parsing, input validation, dependency injection for report generation, and output. It does not perform network activity, handle secrets, or execute dynamic code. Error handling via sys.exit() is standard. External modules are assumed legitimate. No malicious patterns or obfuscation are present. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
