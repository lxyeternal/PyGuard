  "conclusion": "The overall assessment is that the code is mostly benign, with Report 3 presenting a significant security concern due to dynamic code execution. Slight score adjustments improve accuracy, especially for Report 3. Final scores: malware ~0.4, obfuscated ~0.2-0.3, security risk ~0.3-0.6, consistent with the detailed analysis."
