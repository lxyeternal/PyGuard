  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code segments involving eval/exec, environment variables, network/file operations, hardcoded secrets, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic code execution points, network connections, data leaks, and file manipulations.",
  "flows": "Sources such as untrusted input or environment variables leading to eval/exec or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted data, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious variable names.",
  "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify benign code with low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 3 highlights eval/exec usage, which poses high security risk; the current malware score of 0.25 underestimates this. Adjusting malware score to 0.4 and security risk to 0.6 better reflects the potential danger. Other reports show no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation, with scores aligned to their descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment is that the code is mostly benign, with Report 3 presenting a significant security concern due to dynamic code execution. Slight score adjustments improve accuracy, especially for Report 3. Final scores: malware ~0.4, obfuscated ~0.2-0.3, security risk ~0.3-0.6, consistent with the detailed analysis.",
