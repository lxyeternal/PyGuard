  "purpose": "A dependency injection container managing dependencies and cleanup callbacks.",
  "sources": "Registration of dependencies via 'provide', registration of callbacks via 'on_close', and access to dependencies via 'get'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of callbacks registered through 'on_close' during 'close', which could execute arbitrary code if callbacks are malicious.",
  "flows": "Dependencies are provided and retrieved; callbacks are stored and executed during 'close'. Malicious callbacks could be triggered here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. The only potential concern is executing callbacks during 'close', which is standard but requires trusted callbacks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple IoC container with dependency registration and retrieval, and callback management for cleanup. No obfuscation or malicious logic is present. The main security concern is that registered callbacks are executed during 'close', which could be exploited if untrusted callbacks are registered. The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious code detected. The security risk score is 0.2, reflecting a low concern due to callback execution but not inherently malicious. The code's structure and logic are clear, and no vulnerabilities like code injection or secret leakage are evident. The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code, and the overall confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dependency injection container with a standard callback mechanism for cleanup. The primary security consideration is trusting the registered callbacks, but no malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The assigned scores accurately reflect this low-risk, non-malicious status.",
