{
  "purpose": "A dependency injection container class for managing object lifecycles and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class attributes such as _dependecy_by_type and _callbacks_to_close, and method parameters such as callback in on_close().",
  "sinks": "The callback functions added via on_close() can be invoked during close(), potentially executing untrusted code if such callbacks are maliciously injected.",
  "flows": "Callback functions provided to on_close() are stored and later executed in close(); data from _dependecy_by_type is retrieved via get() but only from internal dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. The class is a straightforward implementation of dependency management. Typing annotations and use of cast() are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dependency injection container with methods to provide dependencies, retrieve them, register cleanup callbacks, duplicate the container, and execute cleanup callbacks. No external input processing or network activity is present. The callbacks could potentially execute arbitrary code when invoked during close(). However, the code itself does not include any malicious logic or suspicious behavior. The only notable point is that callbacks added via on_close() are executed during close(), which could be exploited if malicious callbacks are registered, but this is typical for cleanup routines. Overall, the code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple IoC container implementation with no inherent malicious behavior. The primary security concern is ensuring that callbacks registered are trusted, as they are executed during close(). There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent in the provided code.",
