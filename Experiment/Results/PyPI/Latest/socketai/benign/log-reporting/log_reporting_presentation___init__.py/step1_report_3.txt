  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific functionality, but the exact intent cannot be determined from the provided code snippet.",
  "sources": "Input is read from environment variables, function parameters, and potentially external data sources such as network or files.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can flow into system calls, network transmissions, file writes, or database queries depending on the code's operations.",
  "flows": "Data from sources such as environment variables or user inputs flows into sensitive operations like network connections, file I/O, or database commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. No hidden backdoors or cryptic dynamic code execution was observed. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is reviewed step-by-step: It begins with standard imports and function definitions. It reads environment variables and user inputs. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, system modification, or covert communications. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard. No obfuscation, suspicious URLs, or dangerous system calls are present. The code structure is clear and typical for legitimate applications.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no evidence of malware, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
