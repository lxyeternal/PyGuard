      "conclusion": "Most reports accurately assess the code's security posture. Report 1 shows moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting a malware score of 0.3 and risk of 0.55. Other reports are consistent with benign behavior. Slightly lowering Report 1's malware score from 0.4 to 0.3 enhances alignment with suspicion levels. Overall, the scoring is appropriate and reflects the evidence."

      "conclusion": "The overall assessment is that the code is mostly benign, with Report 3 presenting a significant security concern due to dynamic code execution. Slight score adjustments improve accuracy, especially for Report 3. Final scores: malware ~0.4, obfuscated ~0.2-0.3, security risk ~0.3-0.6, consistent with the detailed analysis."

The minimal security risk score reflects potential reflection of malicious input if untrusted data is passed, but this is inherent to output formatting functions and not a vulnerability in the code itself."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code shows high-risk patterns like dynamic code execution and obfuscation but lacks evidence of malicious payloads. The primary concern is the unsafe use of 'exec'/'eval', which warrants further review and input sanitization. Scores are consistent with the observed patterns, with a low malware likelihood but elevated security risk due to code practices."

The primary security consideration is trusting the registered callbacks, but no malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The assigned scores accurately reflect this low-risk, non-malicious status."

The low security risk score is justified by the lack of input validation, which warrants attention but does not constitute malicious intent. Overall, the package is considered safe with minor caution advised for input validation practices."
