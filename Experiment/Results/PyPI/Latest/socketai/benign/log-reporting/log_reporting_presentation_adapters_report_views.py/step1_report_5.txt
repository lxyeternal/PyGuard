{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes to convert log report data into view formats for reporting purposes.",
  "sources": "Data sources are the input report objects, such as HandlerReport and Report, provided to the report_view methods.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a formatted report view via the handler_report_table function; no direct sink for untrusted data is present.",
  "flows": "Input report objects flow into report_view methods, which generate formatted tables as output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code appears to be straightforward data formatting logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules related to logging and reporting, defines custom exception class, and two classes for report view transformations. The HandlerReportTablesAsReportViews class constructs a tuple of rows from report data and passes it to a formatting function. The ReportsAsReportViews class simply returns the report as-is. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data transformation module for reporting purposes with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
