{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for transforming log report data into view representations, specifically for CLI reporting of logs with different levels and endpoint mappings.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'report' object passed to the 'report_view' methods, which contains endpoint mappings, log levels, and total requests.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks or actions involving untrusted data leading to data leaks, system commands, or external effects. The code only processes and formats data for display.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'report' input into the 'rows' variable within 'HandlerReportTablesAsReportViews.report_view', then into the 'handler_report_table' function, which formats the report for display.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present. The code appears straightforward, using standard data classes and mapping logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and defines two report view classes. The first converts 'HandlerReport' objects into CLI table formats by extracting endpoint data and log level counts. The second class is a simple pass-through that returns the report unchanged. No external data input beyond the report object is used. No system commands, network operations, or security-sensitive operations are present. The logic is standard data transformation with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this code. It functions purely as data formatting for reporting purposes, with no suspicious or harmful actions.",
