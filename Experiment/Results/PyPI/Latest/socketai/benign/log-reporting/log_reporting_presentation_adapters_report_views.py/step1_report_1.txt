{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for transforming report data into view formats, specifically for log reports and handler reports.",
  "sources": "The code reads report data from report objects passed into the report_view methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not write data to external systems, perform network operations, or handle untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from report objects into the report_view methods and is transformed into view representations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions and data transformations with type annotations. It imports modules related to logging reports and presentation views, and defines custom exceptions. The report_view methods generate representations of reports without executing any external commands, network requests, or insecure operations. The usage of constants and data classes is standard, and no suspicious patterns or malicious logic are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of data transformation classes for reporting purposes. There is no indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and consistent with typical application code.",
