  "purpose": "Transform handler report data into a CLI report view with counts per log level.",
  "sources": "report.endpoint_map for endpoint data, report.total_requests for total request count",
  "sinks": "handler_report_table function for formatted CLI table output",
  "flows": "report.endpoint_map -> log_level_counter for each endpoint -> counts per log level -> handler_report_table",
  "anomalies": "Potential typo in code: 'log_level_counter' used without clear definition; assumes 'log_level_counter' has a 'map' attribute",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for converting report data into display formats. The main function constructs rows by iterating over report.endpoint_map, extracting counts for each log level via log_level_counter.map[LogLevel.*]. The code appears straightforward and safe, with no external inputs or network activity. The only concern is a possible variable scope or typo issue with 'log_level_counter', but this is a minor correctness concern, not security. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate, though the risk could be slightly lowered to 0 for a conservative security stance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe data formatting implementation with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only issue is a minor correctness typo that does not impact security. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is free from malicious intent.",
