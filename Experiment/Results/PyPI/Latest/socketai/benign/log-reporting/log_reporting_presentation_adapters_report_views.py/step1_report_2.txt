{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for presenting report data in a specific view format, primarily for logging and reporting purposes within an application.",
  "sources": "Data is read from report objects, specifically from report.endpoint_map and report.total_requests.",
  "sinks": "The code generates a report view by calling handler_report_table, which presumably formats the data for display or further processing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from report objects (endpoint_map and total_requests) into the report_view method, then into the handler_report_table function to produce a report view.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code, or unusual patterns. The code uses standard data structures and library imports. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports data classes, custom exception, and report view components. The report_view method constructs a tuple of rows with endpoint and log level counts, then passes this data to a formatter function. The implementation appears straightforward, focusing on data formatting for display purposes. No external input handling, network activity, or file operations are present. The code does not contain any suspicious logic or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data presentation implementation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply formats and displays report data. No malware or security threats identified.",
