  "conclusion": "The code shows high-risk patterns like dynamic code execution and obfuscation but lacks evidence of malicious payloads. The primary concern is the unsafe use of 'exec'/'eval', which warrants further review and input sanitization. Scores are consistent with the observed patterns, with a low malware likelihood but elevated security risk due to code practices."
