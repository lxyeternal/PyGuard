  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, external inputs, dynamic code execution functions ('exec', 'eval'), network or file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, system commands, environment variables, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user inputs) pass through 'exec'/'eval' or are used in network/file operations, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' and 'eval' without input validation, high obfuscation scores, dynamic code patterns, reading environment variables, complex or obscure code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns such as reading environment variables and using 'exec'/'eval', which are inherently risky if inputs are untrusted. No concrete malicious payloads are observed, but these functions can be exploited for code injection. Obfuscation and dynamic behaviors increase the potential attack surface. No suspicious network connections or backdoors are confirmed. The absence of hardcoded credentials or direct malicious actions suggests a moderate security concern primarily due to risky code patterns rather than confirmed malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows high-risk patterns like dynamic code execution and obfuscation but lacks evidence of malicious payloads. The primary concern is the unsafe use of 'exec'/'eval', which warrants further review and input sanitization. Scores are consistent with the observed patterns, with a low malware likelihood but elevated security risk due to code practices.",
