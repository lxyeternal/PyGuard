{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a standard Python script for data processing with no explicit malicious intent evident.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from command-line arguments or files (e.g., sys.argv, open files). Environment variables may be accessed using os.environ.",
  "sinks": "Data may be written to files or displayed via print statements; network connections are not evident but should be checked if present.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input flows into processing functions, but no clear path leads to network transmission or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical data operations such as reading input, processing data, and outputting results. Usage of standard libraries without suspicious functions. No external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no hidden behaviors noted. The structure and variable naming are clear and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no indication of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code seems to be a benign data processing script with no suspicious features.",
