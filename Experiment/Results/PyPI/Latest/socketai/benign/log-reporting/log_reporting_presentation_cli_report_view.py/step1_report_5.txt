{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to generate a formatted table report for handler request statistics, including total requests and per-handler request counts, for presentation in a CLI.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters: total_requests (int) and rows (sequence of tuples with string and integers). No external data sources or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'table' function to generate a string representation of the table. No untrusted data directly influencing system state or network operations. The data flows into string formatting and display functions.",
  "flows": "Data from input parameters is sorted and formatted into a table string, then returned as a new string. No untrusted data reaches insecure system calls or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code uses standard data handling and formatting; no obfuscation or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, defines data types and formatting layouts, and creates a function to generate a report table. It sorts input data, formats it into a table, and adds a total requests summary. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present; the code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of report formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for generating CLI report tables for request handling metrics. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident based on the provided code.",
