{
  "purpose": "Define a table layout and generate a formatted report string of handler request statistics, including total requests and sorted data.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'rows' and 'total_requests'; external 'table' function for formatting.",
  "sinks": "Returns a formatted string representing the report; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from parameters into sorting and string formatting functions, culminating in the returned report string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for formatting and displaying request statistics in a table. It sorts input data by handler name, constructs a total request view, and combines these into a string using an external formatting function. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code relies on standard and known libraries, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0-0.1) are consistent with its benign, utility nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward report formatting utility with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned across the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications or higher risk assessments are justified.",
