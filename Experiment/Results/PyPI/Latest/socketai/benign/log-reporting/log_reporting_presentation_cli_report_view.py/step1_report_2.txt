{
  "purpose": "Define a table layout and generate a formatted handler report table with total request count and rows data.",
  "sources": "Input parameters total_requests and rows, which are external data inputs.",
  "sinks": "The function calls to 'table' and string formatting that generate the output string.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through sorting and formatting into the table function, then combined into the output string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a table layout using imported classes and formats a report table based on provided data. It sorts the rows by handler name and constructs a string that includes the total requests and a formatted table. All operations involve standard data handling and string formatting, with no suspicious or malicious activities detected. No external input is directly used in a dangerous manner, and no sensitive information is hardcoded or leaked. The usage appears to be for report generation, typical in logging or monitoring contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward report formatting utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply organizes data into a tabular string representation for display or logging purposes.",
