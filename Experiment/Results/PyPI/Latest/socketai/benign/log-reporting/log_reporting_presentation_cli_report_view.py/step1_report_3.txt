  "purpose": "Define a table layout and generate a formatted report table for handler request statistics.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'total_requests' (int) and 'rows' (sequence of tuples with strings and ints).",
  "sinks": "Return statement constructs a string by formatting the table and total requests; no external untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters into string formatting functions, with sorting applied to 'rows'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data structure and a function to generate a report table. It sorts input data and formats output string. No external or untrusted data sources or sinks that could be malicious are present. No suspicious logic or behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for generating a formatted report table, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
