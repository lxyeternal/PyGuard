{
  "purpose": "This code defines a data structure and a function to generate a formatted table report of handler request statistics.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'total_requests' (integer), 'rows' (sequence of tuples containing string and integers).",
  "sinks": "The function returns a string encapsulated in a NewType; no direct untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the function; data is sorted and formatted into a table string, then returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no unusual or suspicious code patterns. Usage of external table formatting library is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary types and a table formatting library, defines a new type for the report string, and a layout for table columns. The function 'handler_report_table' takes total request count and row data, sorts the rows by handler name, formats them into a table, and appends a total requests line. No untrusted input processing, no data leakage, no malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected. The logic is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and primarily focused on data formatting. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk score is very low.",
