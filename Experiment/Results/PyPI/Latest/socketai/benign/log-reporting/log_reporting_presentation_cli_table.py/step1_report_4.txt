  "purpose": "Define a customizable table layout system with column formatting and rendering functions.",
  "sources": "Input data from rows parameter in the table() function; input data for columns such as name, width, and field values.",
  "sinks": "String formatting functions such as _filled() and field() methods that generate formatted output; potential data leakage through string manipulation.",
  "flows": "Input rows -> column.field() methods -> string formatting in _filled() -> join operations for table rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No external network access, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for table column layouts and a table rendering function. It performs input validation for column name length, positive numbers, string truncation, and consistent row sizes. The use of exception classes is standard for error handling. No external data sources, network operations, or security-sensitive functions are present. String operations are straightforward and do not introduce code injection risks. Overall, the code appears to be a benign, well-structured layout utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a safe, well-defined table layout system without any signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It strictly handles formatting and layout logic with standard Python features.",
