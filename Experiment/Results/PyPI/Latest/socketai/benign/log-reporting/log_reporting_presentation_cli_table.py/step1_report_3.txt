{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for creating and formatting table layouts with columns of different types, and for rendering these tables as strings.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the 'rows' parameter in the 'table' function, which is a sequence of sequences containing data to be formatted in table columns.",
  "sinks": "String formatting operations such as in '_filled' method and 'field' methods, which produce formatted output strings. No external data sinks, network operations, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input 'rows' into the 'table' function, then into the 'field' methods of column objects for formatting, and finally into the output string returned by 'table'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, or use of dynamic execution. The code appears to be standard implementation for table formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes and dataclasses for representing table columns and layouts. 'ColumnLayout' and its subclasses handle data formatting, raising exceptions if input data does not meet certain criteria (e.g., negative numbers). The 'table' function assembles a string representation of the table, with input validation for consistent row sizes. All operations are standard string manipulations and data formatting. There are no network operations, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, straightforward implementation of table formatting classes and functions without any malicious intent or malicious behavior. It does not perform any external communication or data leaks. The code structure and logic are consistent with intended functionality, and there are no signs of sabotage or malware.",
