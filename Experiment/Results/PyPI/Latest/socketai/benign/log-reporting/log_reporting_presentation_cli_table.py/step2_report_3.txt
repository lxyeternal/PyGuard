  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the underlying code for potential security issues, malware, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of a table layout and formatting system, with data validation and string formatting.\n- No external system calls, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The data flows are limited to internal string processing and formatting.\n- Exception handling is standard, and no hardcoded secrets or credentials are evident.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscated patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** The reviewer concludes no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and very low security risk.\n- **Assessment:** The score of 0.1 for security risk seems appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions.\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** Correctly scored as 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Analysis:** Same as above, straightforward code with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- **Assessment:** The zero scores for malware and obfuscation are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Analysis:** Again, no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The scores are consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** Similar reasoning; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The slight security risk score (0.1) is reasonable, perhaps reflecting the fact that if untrusted data is passed, it could be reflected in output, but this is typical for formatting utilities.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** Same reasoning applies; no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) might be justified if considering that malicious data in 'rows' could lead to reflected output, but this is a common concern in output formatting and not an actual vulnerability.\n- **Conclusion:** Still reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Justification & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All correctly assign 0; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Very low across all reports, generally between 0.1 and 0.2, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The only potential concern is that if 'rows' contain malicious data, it could lead to reflected output, but this is typical for any string formatting utility and not indicative of malicious intent.\n- No code execution, network activity, or external dependencies are involved.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 – 0.2 (minimal, mostly related to output reflection if data is malicious, but not a security vulnerability)\n\n**In conclusion, all reports are accurate and reasonable in their scoring. The code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation, and only minimal security considerations related to data reflection in output.**",
