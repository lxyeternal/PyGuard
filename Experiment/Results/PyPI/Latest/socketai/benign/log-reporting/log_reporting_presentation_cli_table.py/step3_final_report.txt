{
  "purpose": "A utility for creating formatted textual tables with customizable column layouts and validation.",
  "sources": "Input data provided in 'rows' parameter, and class attributes such as 'columns' and 'column_separator'.",
  "sinks": "Generated string output representing the table; no external sinks or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'rows' into column 'field' methods, then into string joins to produce the final table string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Validation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for column layout with validation, and a 'table' function that constructs a textual table. It performs straightforward string formatting, validation, and exception handling. No external system calls, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The data flow is limited to internal string processing. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured table formatting utility with no malicious intent or security issues. The minimal security risk score reflects potential reflection of malicious input if untrusted data is passed, but this is inherent to output formatting functions and not a vulnerability in the code itself.",
