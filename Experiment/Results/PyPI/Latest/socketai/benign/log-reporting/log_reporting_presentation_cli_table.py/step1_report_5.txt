{
  "purpose": "Define a system for creating and rendering table layouts with various column types and enforce constraints on data and format.",
  "sources": "Input data from the 'rows' parameter in the 'table' function; column data from 'field' methods of ColumnLayout subclasses.",
  "sinks": "Generated string output of the table, which could potentially include manipulated or malicious data if user-controlled input is passed to 'rows'.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from 'rows' into the 'table' function, through 'field' methods, into string concatenation for output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external connections are present. The code uses standard exception handling and data formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for layout management with validation, and a 'table' function that formats data into a string table. All data flows involve formatting data into strings without executing or evaluating untrusted code. No external system calls, network operations, or unsafe operations are present. The use of standard string manipulation, data validation through exceptions, and absence of dynamic code execution suggest no malicious intent. The input is only used for formatting, and output is a formatted string of table data, which can be manipulated if user-controlled input is passed, but this does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward table formatting utility with proper validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The primary security consideration is that if 'rows' contain malicious data, it will be reflected in the output, but this is expected for such a utility and not inherently malicious.",
