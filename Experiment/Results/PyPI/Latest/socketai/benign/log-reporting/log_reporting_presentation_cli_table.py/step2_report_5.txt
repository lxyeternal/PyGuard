  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their assessments with the code, and then synthesize an overall security stance.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a table formatting utility, with data coming from input rows and class attributes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external sinks; data flows internally into string formatting.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no external system interactions. The code performs straightforward string formatting and validation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes no malicious intent, with high confidence (0.9). The malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; the code is for creating and rendering tables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external sinks; data is formatted into strings.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; validation is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is benign, with full confidence (1). Malware score remains 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous; input data flows into formatting functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** String formatting only.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns; validation is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly assesses safety, high confidence (0.95). Malware score is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with previous; input data for layout and formatting.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** String operations for display.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or external interactions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes safety, with full confidence (1). Malware score is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general purpose; data from 'rows' for formatting.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** String output, potentially reflecting malicious input if provided.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No external system calls or dynamic code execution; the code is a pure formatter.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states that maliciousness depends on input, but the code itself is safe. Security risk is minimal and mainly about data handling, not code behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No malicious code, just the potential for malicious data reflection, which is typical for such utilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is a straightforward table formatting utility. No actual vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher in some reports (up to 0.2), mainly because if user-controlled data is malicious, it could lead to display issues or data leakage. However, this is expected and not a security vulnerability in the code itself.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and aligned with the code's behavior.\n- The code does not contain malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The only potential concern is the reflection of malicious input, but this is inherent to any data display function and not a security flaw.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, mainly about data validation, not security vulnerability)\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is a safe, standard table formatting utility with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The only potential security consideration is handling malicious input, which is outside the scope of code vulnerabilities but relevant for application security policies.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks beyond standard data validation considerations.",
