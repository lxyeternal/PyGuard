  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code and the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward table formatting utility with no malicious intent, malware, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** The reviewer notes no signs of malicious code, external system access, or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.1) seems to reflect a minimal concern, possibly due to the fact that outputting formatted strings can be misused if untrusted data is passed, but this is typical for such utilities.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's benign nature and standard data formatting.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Analysis:** The reviewer explicitly states no malicious behavior, external activity, or obfuscation. The security risk is zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Well justified; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a legitimate table formatter with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Analysis:** The review emphasizes safe string operations, validation, and lack of external system interaction.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar conclusion: a safe, well-structured layout utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** The reviewer notes that the only potential concern is if user-controlled data in 'rows' is malicious, but this is expected for such formatting code.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the potential for malicious data if 'rows' contain user-controlled input, but clarifies that this is typical and not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** The slightly higher security risk score (0.2) accounts for the fact that if the input data is malicious (e.g., containing malicious strings), it could be reflected in the output. This is a common concern with output formatting functions, but it does not indicate malicious code within the utility itself.\n- **Verdict:** Justified; the code does not perform any malicious actions, but outputting untrusted data always carries some risk.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate. The code does not contain any malicious payloads, network activity, or code injection.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the nature of the code—string formatting and data validation—these are reasonable. The risk primarily hinges on whether untrusted data is displayed, which is expected in such a utility but should be noted.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The risk scores could be slightly increased to 0.2 across all reports for uniformity, considering that untrusted data could be reflected, but this is a common and accepted aspect of output formatting utilities.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code present)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (reflects potential issues with untrusted input, but not a security vulnerability per se)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of a table formatting utility with appropriate validation and no malicious intent. The minimal security risk score reflects the potential for reflected malicious data if input is untrusted, which is typical for such functions but does not indicate inherent security flaws.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese assessments align with the detailed reviews and the nature of the code.",
