{
  "purpose": "This code defines a framework for creating and formatting table layouts with different column types, and generating textual tables from data rows.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'rows' parameter in the 'table' function; it reads class attribute values from method calls and data class initializations.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily outputs strings for table display; no sinks directly involve untrusted data processing or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'rows' flows into the 'table' function, which then calls column-specific 'field' methods to generate formatted strings, culminating in a joined table string output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual code patterns are present. The code performs straightforward string formatting and data validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several data classes representing table columns with validation to prevent invalid data (e.g., negative numbers). The 'table' function generates a formatted string table from input rows, ensuring consistent column counts. There are no indications of malicious code or data leakage mechanisms. All data flows are internal, mainly formatting and display logic. No external network access, file I/O, or environment variable usage occurs, and no obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard table formatting utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs data validation and string formatting for presentation purposes. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code is straightforward and safe.",
