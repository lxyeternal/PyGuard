  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or interaction with external systems, but without the actual code, the specific purpose cannot be confirmed.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from variables, environment variables, or external files; possibly fetching data from network sources or APIs.",
  "sinks": "Writing data to files, sending data over network connections, executing system commands, or interacting with databases.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, potentially via intermediate processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No specific anomalies detected without the code. Need to verify for hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of the actual code snippet, the analysis is limited. Generally, review would include checking for hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, dynamic eval usage, or obfuscated code. Without the code, detailed flow analysis and anomaly detection are not possible.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to determine malicious behavior definitively. No overt malicious patterns can be identified without reviewing the actual code. Further examination of the code content is required.",
