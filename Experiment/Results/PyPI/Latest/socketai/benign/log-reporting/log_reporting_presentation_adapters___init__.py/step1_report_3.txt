  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or configuration tasks, but without additional context, its precise purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, imported modules, and possibly external files or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network communication, file writing, or system commands if such code exists.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or external inputs to sinks such as network, file system, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs detected. No obfuscated code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is either minimal or not provided explicitly. Without specific code snippets, the review is limited. There are no signs of malicious data handling, unusual code patterns, or security-critical operations. Absence of suspicious behavior or obfuscation reduces concern.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the lack of explicit code or suspicious patterns, the code does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks. The assessment is limited by the absence of code content, resulting in low confidence.",
