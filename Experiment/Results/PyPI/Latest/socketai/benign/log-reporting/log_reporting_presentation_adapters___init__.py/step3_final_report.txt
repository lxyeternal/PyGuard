  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, standard input, potential network or file sources, system calls.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, subprocess executions, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or input flows into network/file/system commands without validation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected; lack of input validation noted as a potential risk.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The primary concern is unvalidated inputs which could be exploited in specific contexts. The absence of code in some reports limits certainty, but scores are consistent with the cautious assessments. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and security risk is approximately 0.2, reflecting potential input validation issues but no active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified by the lack of input validation, which warrants attention but does not constitute malicious intent. Overall, the package is considered safe with minor caution advised for input validation practices.",
