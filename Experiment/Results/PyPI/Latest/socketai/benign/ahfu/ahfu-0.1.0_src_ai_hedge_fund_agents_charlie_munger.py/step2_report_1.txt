  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the risk scores.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The review states the code is transparent, with no obfuscation, malicious behaviors, or suspicious API usage. External API calls are standard for financial data gathering, and no signs of malware or sabotage are evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — these are reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The high confidence (0.95) aligns with the thorough analysis. No issues detected.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the analysis confirms the code is straightforward, with standard API calls, no obfuscation, and no malicious activity. The confidence is even higher (1.0).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the slight securityRisk is acceptable given the external API usage, but no malicious intent is evident.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; no suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.** No adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** The analysis states the code is well-structured, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or sabotage. External API functions are standard, and no malicious behaviors are observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — a small security risk score reflects cautious acknowledgment of external API reliance but is reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.** No change needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar conclusions—no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The code is a legitimate analysis tool with standard external API calls.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — appropriate given the external dependencies.\n- **Justification:** The confidence is high (0.95), and reasoning aligns with the code's transparency.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.** No adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** The review emphasizes the code's transparency, standard API usage, and absence of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The confidence is perfect (1.0), and the security risk is minimal.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is thorough and justified.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly note no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** The small securityRisk (~0.1) reflects the external API reliance but is reasonable given the context.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malware detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal risk due to external API calls, but no malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, justified, and accurate. No further adjustments are necessary.",
