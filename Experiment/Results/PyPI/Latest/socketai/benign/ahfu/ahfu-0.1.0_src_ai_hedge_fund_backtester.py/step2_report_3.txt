  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code implements a backtesting framework with data fetching, decision execution, and performance analysis, based on user inputs and external data functions.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Executes trades, updates portfolio, fetches data, and visualizes results.  \n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report states the code is standard, well-structured, and does not contain malicious behavior. The logic supports realistic trading with no signs of sabotage or malware.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious patterns are evident. The code appears legitimate.  \n**Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with data fetched via functions like `get_price_data`, `get_financial_metrics`, etc.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evident data exfiltration; outputs are logs and plots.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a comprehensive backtest with standard logic. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's structure; no malicious activity detected.  \n**Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Implements a backtest with data fetching, user prompts, and decision logic.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard data flow, no network activity beyond data fetching.  \n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is legitimate, with typical data collection and trading logic. No malicious behavior or backdoors are apparent.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no malware or malicious intent evident.  \n**Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports; involves user inputs, data fetches, and decision-making.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network connections or data leaks outside legitimate data fetches.  \n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate backtest framework with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is solid; no malware or malicious patterns detected.  \n**Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard backtest with user inputs, data fetches, and decision execution.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external leaks; data used internally.  \n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical backtesting framework with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious activity or malware signs.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, and reasoning confirms no malicious code is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, and no obfuscation is evident.\n- **Risk scores:** All are very low (0 or 0.1), consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code, network activity, or backdoors)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code with no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to external data fetches and user inputs, which are standard)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured backtesting framework with no malicious or security risk indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Maintain a very low security risk score (~0.1).  \n- The overall confidence remains high (~0.9), given the consistent analysis.\n\n**Work out the scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the nature of the code.",
