  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured backtesting framework with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The external data dependencies are typical and do not introduce malicious vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is minimal, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1), justified by external data reliance but no malicious behavior."
