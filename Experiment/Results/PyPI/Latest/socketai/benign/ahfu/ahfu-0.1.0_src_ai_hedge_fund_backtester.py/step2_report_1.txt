  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, focusing on potential security risks, malware indicators, and logical consistency.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a comprehensive backtesting framework for trading strategies, supporting long/short positions, data fetching, performance metrics, and user interaction.\n- None of the reports identify suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity.\n- The assessments assign high confidence (~0.9) that the code is legitimate, with malware scores at 0 and minimal security risks (0.1-0.2).\n- The reports emphasize that the code uses standard libraries, external data fetch functions, and typical trading logic, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues and logical consistency:\n- **Code functionality** aligns with the described purpose.\n- **Trade execution logic** supports realistic long/short operations with margin considerations.\n- **Performance metrics** calculations are standard.\n- **User prompts and data fetching** are typical for such applications.\n- **No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code** are evident.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- External data fetch functions (`get_price_data`, `get_prices`, etc.) are assumed legitimate but could be compromised if the modules are malicious. However, this is a general risk in external dependencies, not specific to this code.\n- No network activity or data exfiltration observed.\n- No hardcoded credentials or secrets.\n- No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation.\n\n### Malware and security risk scores:\n- All reports assign **malware = 0** and **securityRisk = 0.1-0.2**, which seems reasonable given the absence of malicious indicators.\n- The high confidence scores support the conclusion that the code is benign.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The **risk score** (0.1-0.2) is low but not zero, acknowledging the external dependencies and user inputs, which could be exploited if compromised.\n- The **malware score** (0) is appropriate, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code appears legitimate, with no malicious intent or behavior.\n- The external modules are assumed to be secure and legitimate.\n- The overall security risk is minimal, primarily related to external dependencies, which is typical.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | **0**           | No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected. |\n| Obfuscated       | **0**           | Clear, well-structured code with no obfuscation patterns.     |\n| Risk             | **0.1**         | Slight risk from external dependencies and user inputs, but overall very low. |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured backtesting framework with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The low risk score reflects typical external dependency concerns, but overall, it is safe and legitimate.",
