  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the logical consistency, potential risks, and whether the scores align with the described code behavior.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe code that fetches financial data via API calls, with caching, environment variable API keys, and standard data parsing.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are noted.\n- The code's purpose is data retrieval, with no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or malware.\n- The reported malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the descriptions.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Clear, describes standard API interaction, caching, and data handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation noted.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher, perhaps due to the use of environment variables and external API calls, but still low.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard practices.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, appropriate given the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same pattern, standard API usage, caching, environment variables.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — consistent with previous assessments.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as others, no anomalies.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Consistent with previous reports.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores align well.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, matching the straightforward code analysis.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), justified by the use of environment variables for API keys and external API calls, but no real vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\nGiven the code and reports, I concur with the provided scores. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured API client with caching, no obfuscation, and no malware.\n\n**Proposed scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, primarily due to external API interactions and environment variable handling, which are standard practices.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and the scores appropriately reflect the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
