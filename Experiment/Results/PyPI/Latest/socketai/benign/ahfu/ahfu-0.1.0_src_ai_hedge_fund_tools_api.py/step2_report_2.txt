  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, consistency of scores, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code fetches financial data, handles API keys via environment variables, uses caching, and performs standard data parsing. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware indicated.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem reasonable given the description.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion that the code is safe and legitimate aligns with the detailed analysis. The confidence score of 0.95 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard API interactions, environment variable API key management, and no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are consistent.\n- **Assessment:** The detailed reasoning supports the conclusion that the code is safe. The confidence score of 0.9 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—standard API requests, cache, environment variables, no obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 fit the description.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent, and the conclusion that the code is safe is reasonable. Confidence of 0.9 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard data retrieval, caching, environment variable API key, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning supports the conclusion of safety and legitimacy.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical data retrieval module with no signs of malicious activity, proper API key handling, and standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 fit the description.\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code:** None detected in any report.\n- **API key handling:** Properly managed via environment variables across all reports.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious logic.\n- **Scores consistency:** All malware and obfuscated scores are zero, and security risks are low (~0.1-0.2), matching the analysis.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1-0.2 (standard API interaction with minimal risk)\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured financial data API client with proper security practices. No malicious or obfuscated code is present, and the low security risk scores are justified.",
