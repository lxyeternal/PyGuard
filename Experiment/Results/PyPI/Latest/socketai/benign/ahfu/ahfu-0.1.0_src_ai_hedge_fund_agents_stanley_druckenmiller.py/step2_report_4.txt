  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The report finds no malicious or suspicious elements. It notes standard data fetching, analysis, and prompt generation. No obfuscation, malware, or security risks are identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is consistent; the code appears to be a straightforward financial analysis agent leveraging external APIs and an LLM for signals. No signs of malicious behavior are present.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or sabotage. Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) possibly due to the external LLM interaction, but still within normal bounds.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Justification:** The external call to `call_llm` is standard in AI applications. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, the analysis finds no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior. The external data fetching and LLM interactions are typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n- **Justification:** The low security risk score aligns with the benign assessment. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous reports, no malicious or obfuscated code, standard data flow, and safe external API usage.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Justification:** The external LLM call is a normal pattern, and no malicious activity is detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** The same conclusion—no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and standard data analysis flow.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n- **Justification:** The code is a typical data analysis pipeline with AI prompt engineering, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm the code matches the provided source; no obfuscation or malicious modifications are evident.\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0 across all reports. No signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, mostly due to external API calls (which are standard). Slightly higher in some reports (up to 0.2), but still within normal bounds for AI/financial data pipelines.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** All reports agree that the code is a legitimate financial analysis tool, with standard patterns and no suspicious behavior.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0.0**. No evidence suggests malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the external API interactions are standard and no malicious behavior is detected, a conservative but reasonable estimate is **0.1 to 0.2**. I suggest **0.1** for a minimal risk assessment.\n- **Overall security posture:** Safe, legitimate, and standard for AI-driven financial analysis tools.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my final estimate:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| **0.0**        | **0**             | **0.1**   |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
