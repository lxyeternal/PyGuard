{
  "purpose": "The script facilitates running a hedge fund trading simulation by orchestrating AI agent workflows, model selection, user input, and portfolio management.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments (tickers, dates, model options), environment variables (via dotenv), user interactions through questionary prompts, and data parsing functions.",
  "sinks": "Data sinks include network calls to external APIs or services for model inference, print statements for logging, file saving for graph visualization, and console outputs. The code also reads environment variables which could potentially contain secrets.",
  "flows": "Sources (user input, environment variables) feed into model selection, workflow creation, and portfolio initialization. Data flows through the agent invocation, response parsing, and finally outputs trading decisions and signals. User inputs influence analyst selection and model choice, affecting subsequent processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual language features. Use of environment variables is standard for config. The code handles parsing and user prompts securely. No hidden network connections or malicious data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code securely loads environment variables, uses standard libraries, and implements input validation. User prompts for analyst and model selection appear typical. The workflow creation uses standard data structures and explicit node connections. The parsing function includes error handling. There are no signs of malicious payloads, secret exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. All data flows are logical and relevant to a trading system. No embedded or hidden malicious code segments identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured application for orchestrating AI-driven trading workflows. It does not contain any malicious code, sabotage, or malware. Its security risk is minimal, primarily limited to standard considerations of environment variable management and user input validation.",
