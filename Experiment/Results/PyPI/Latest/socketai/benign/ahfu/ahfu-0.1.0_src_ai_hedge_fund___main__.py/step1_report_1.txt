{
  "purpose": "The script orchestrates a hedge fund trading system, managing data input, agent workflows, model selection, and output presentation.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables from a '.env' file, command-line arguments, user input via questionary prompts, and potentially external models or agents.",
  "sinks": "Outputs parsed responses, logs, and decision summaries to the console; potentially invokes external agents and models; loads environment variables; saves visual graphs.",
  "flows": "User input → model selection and environment setup → workflow creation and invocation → response parsing → output display; environment variables and user prompts influence configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network connections or data exfiltration evident; no obfuscated or malicious code detected; no direct system modification or backdoors apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles user interaction, workflow setup, environment configuration, and invoking external modules for analysis and decision-making. It loads environment variables securely, uses standard libraries and functions, and includes safeguards like input validation and error handling. No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. External dependencies are used in conventional ways, and no embedded or hidden malicious behavior is detected. The code appears to be a legitimate orchestration script for a complex financial decision system.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured orchestration code for a hedge fund simulation, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It handles user input, environment variables, and external modules safely. No indicators of malware or sabotage are identified.",
