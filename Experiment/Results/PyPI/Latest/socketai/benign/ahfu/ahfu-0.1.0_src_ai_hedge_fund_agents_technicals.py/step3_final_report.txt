  "purpose": "Analyze the provided Python code implementing technical analysis strategies for trading signals, assessing for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "External functions (`get_prices`, `show_agent_reasoning`) for data retrieval and display; data inputs from `state['data']`; indicator calculations within functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted data in a malicious manner; data flows are limited to calculations and report generation.",
  "flows": "Data fetched via `get_prices` flows into indicator functions; signals are combined via `weighted_signal_combination`; results are compiled into JSON report.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code relies on standard libraries and straightforward calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard financial technical analysis with well-known indicators (EMA, ADX, Bollinger Bands, RSI, Hurst exponent). External functions are for data fetching and reporting, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. No network activity beyond data retrieval is present. The code structure is clear, and no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are evident. Scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior and scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of trading analysis strategies. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified and accurate.",
