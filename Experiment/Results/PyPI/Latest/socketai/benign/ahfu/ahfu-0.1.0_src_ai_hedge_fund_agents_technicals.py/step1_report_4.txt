{
  "purpose": "The code implements a technical analysis agent for trading, calculating various signals (trend, mean reversion, momentum, volatility, statistical arbitrage) to generate trading signals for multiple tickers.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include get_prices() function for fetching price data, and several calculations on pandas DataFrames derived from this data.",
  "sinks": "Generated signals and reports are formatted into JSON messages for human analysis, and data is stored in the agent state. No direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Price data fetched via get_prices() flows through multiple indicator calculations, then into weighted_signal_combination, producing a final trading signal, which is stored and communicated.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses standard libraries and well-structured functions. No obfuscated code, no malicious API calls, or hidden network connections.",
  "analysis": "The code performs technical analysis by computing various indicators like EMAs, ADX, Bollinger Bands, RSI, Hurst exponent, etc. It processes data fetched from an external API function get_prices, then combines signals to produce a trading recommendation. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection observed. The functions are standard in trading algorithms and do not contain malicious behavior. The use of pandas, numpy, and math libraries is typical. All data manipulations are within normal bounds for such analysis. No hardcoded secrets or unexpected behaviors found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate technical analysis agent designed for trading strategies. It relies on standard financial calculations and data processing methods. No malicious intent or security risks identified. Overall, the code is well-structured, conventional, and free from malicious behavior.",
