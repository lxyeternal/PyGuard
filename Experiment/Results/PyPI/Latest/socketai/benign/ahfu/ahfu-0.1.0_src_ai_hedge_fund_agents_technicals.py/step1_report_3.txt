{
  "purpose": "The code implements a technical analysis agent for trading strategies, including data fetching, signal calculations, and signal combination for multiple tickers.",
  "sources": "Data input via state (tickers, dates), external functions (get_prices, prices_to_df), and indicator calculations.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data leaks, system commands, or network transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from get_prices to DataFrame conversions, through indicator functions, into signal combination and output messages.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. Use of math and numpy is standard. No hidden or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a comprehensive implementation of technical analysis strategies for trading signals, utilizing standard indicators such as EMAs, ADX, Bollinger Bands, RSI, and Hurst exponent. All functions perform legitimate calculations for financial analysis without any data exfiltration, network communications, or malicious backdoors. The only external interactions are data fetching and progress updates, which are typical for such applications. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The code structure is clear, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate trading analysis module with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It solely performs standard financial computations and data handling within its scope. The overall security risk is minimal.",
