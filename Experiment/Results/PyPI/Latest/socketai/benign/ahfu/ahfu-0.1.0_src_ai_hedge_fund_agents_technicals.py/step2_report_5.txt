  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, external dependencies, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The analysis states the code is a legitimate, multi-strategy trading system, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors detected. External functions are benign, and the code performs standard financial calculations.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code review. The code uses standard libraries and external functions that appear benign. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident. The risk score is low, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard financial calculations, no network activity, no data exfiltration, and no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The code relies on trusted data sources and performs typical indicator calculations. The risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a legitimate trading analysis module, with no signs of malicious activity. External interactions are limited to data fetching and progress updates.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score reflects the benign nature. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a comprehensive, standard implementation of technical analysis, with no evidence of malicious behavior. It uses common indicators and data processing.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The assessment aligns with the code's functionality. No malicious patterns or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured technical analysis tool, with no malicious behavior. It performs standard calculations and has no external communications beyond data retrieval.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the previous reports; the low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** No evidence in any report or in the code snippets. The functions are standard for financial analysis, with no network activity, no data exfiltration, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected across all reports and code.\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign analysis.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** All are low (0 to 0.2), reflecting minimal security concern. The slight increase to 0.2 in some reports accounts for the complexity of the code but remains reasonable.\n\n- **Potential concerns:** The only potential \"risk\" could be if external data sources (get_prices) are compromised, but there's no evidence or indication of this. The code itself is transparent and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — No obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Slightly above zero but still very low, considering the code's complexity and external dependencies.\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, legitimate, and free from malicious intent.**",
