  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Content:** The report states that no suspicious or malicious code patterns are observed. External functions are assumed legitimate. No code injection, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. The overall conclusion is that the code is a legitimate stock analysis tool following Buffett principles.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (low, possibly due to external API reliance)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code review. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The malware score is appropriately low. The security risk is minimal but acknowledges external dependencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Content:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard data retrieval, analysis, and prompt-based LLM invocation. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors detected. External dependencies are presumed safe.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the previous report. No signs of malicious activity. The malware score remains appropriate at zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Content:** Focuses on the code's systematic approach, external API calls, and safe practices. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is transparent, and external functions are presumed safe.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Very thorough and positive. No malicious indicators. The security risk is even lower here, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Content:** Reinforces the code's legitimate design, external API usage, and absence of malicious patterns. No suspicious network activity or obfuscated code. External dependencies are assumed reputable.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Well justified. The low security risk score aligns with the absence of malicious signs.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Content:** Similar conclusion: no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code. External functions are assumed safe, and data handling is standard.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is legitimate, with no malicious, obfuscated, or sabotage indicators.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the clear code structure.\n- Security risks are minimal, justified by reliance on external APIs and the absence of suspicious patterns.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior or patterns detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, mainly due to external dependencies and data handling)\n\n**My reasoned estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe overall analysis confirms the code's legitimacy as a transparent, external API-driven financial analysis tool with no malicious intent or sabotage.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe provided reports are consistent and justified. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly low, and the risk scores are appropriately minimal. No adjustments are necessary.",
