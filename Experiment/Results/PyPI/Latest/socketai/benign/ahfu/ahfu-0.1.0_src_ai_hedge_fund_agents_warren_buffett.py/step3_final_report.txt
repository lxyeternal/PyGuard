  "purpose": "Analyzes stocks using Buffett's principles and LLM reasoning, fetching financial metrics, line items, market cap, and generating investment signals based on fundamental and qualitative analysis.",
  "sources": "External functions get_financial_metrics, search_line_items, get_market_cap, call_llm; data from AgentState; user input; financial metrics and line items data.",
  "sinks": "Generated WarrenBuffettSignal object; HumanMessage content; updates to progress status; final message with analysis results.",
  "flows": "Data fetched from external APIs (metrics, line items, market cap) → analyzed within functions → analysis results used to generate prompt → call_llm produces signal → results stored and displayed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Code is modular, transparent, and relies on standard external APIs.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically fetches financial data, performs Buffett-style analysis (fundamentals, consistency, moat, management, intrinsic value), and uses an LLM prompt to generate investment signals. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. External dependencies are assumed safe, and the code structure is clear and logical. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior and content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of a Buffett-inspired stock analysis agent. It contains no malicious or sabotage elements, and external dependencies are standard for such applications. The security profile is very low, with no indicators of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
