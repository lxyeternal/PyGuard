  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Finds no suspicious or malicious code patterns; external functions are assumed legitimate; no hardcoded secrets; standard data flow.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies no malicious indicators. The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of suspicious activity. The security risk is low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** No suspicious patterns; external dependencies appear standard; no obfuscated code; straightforward prompt construction.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No signs of malicious behavior. Malware score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious activity; external APIs are presumed safe; transparent prompt construction.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Assessment:** Clear and thorough. No malicious indicators. Malware score and risk assessment are reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** No signs of malicious activity; external APIs are reputable; no suspicious code patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; no malicious signs. The low security risk is justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** No signs of malicious activity; external functions appear safe; no backdoors or obfuscated code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature. Malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Judgment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, indicating no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports are 0, confirming code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security concerns primarily due to external dependencies and data handling, not malicious intent.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (code is transparent and standard)\n- **Risk:** Given the low scores and consistent reasoning, a **risk score of 0.1** seems appropriate, reflecting minimal but inherent risks in external API reliance.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code appears legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious or sabotage elements. External dependencies are standard for financial analysis workflows, and no suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned across reports are consistent and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0.1**\n\nThis aligns with the overall evidence and analysis provided.",
