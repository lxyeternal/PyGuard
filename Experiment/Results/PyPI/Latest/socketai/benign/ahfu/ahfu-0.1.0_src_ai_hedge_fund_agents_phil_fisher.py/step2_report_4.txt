  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues detected. The analysis confirms no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Logic flaws:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, risk is 0.1, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Justification for risk score:** The low risk score aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- **Overall:** Well-reasoned, consistent, and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues detected. The analysis indicates standard data fetching and processing.\n- **Logic flaws:** None apparent.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; risk is 0.1, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification for risk score:** No malicious activity, only external API calls.\n- **Overall:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues found; the code is straightforward.\n- **Logic flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; risk is 0.1.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior; external API use is standard.\n- **Overall:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No malicious activity or obfuscation observed.\n- **Logic flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; risk is 0.1.\n- **Justification:** The analysis confirms the code's benign nature.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues detected.\n- **Logic flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; risk is 0.1.\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a legitimate, well-structured stock analysis agent.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- External API calls are standard and expected.\n- The risk scores (0.1) are justified given the absence of malicious indicators.\n- Malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a typical financial analysis tool with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The external API calls are standard, and no suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The overall security assessment should remain at **minimal risk**, with malware and obfuscation scores at **0**, and a very low risk score of **0.1**.",
