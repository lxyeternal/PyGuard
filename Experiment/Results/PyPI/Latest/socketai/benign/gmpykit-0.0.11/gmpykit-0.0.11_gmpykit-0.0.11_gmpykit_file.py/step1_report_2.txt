  "purpose": "Utility functions for reading and writing pickle and JSON files.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'path' for file operations.",
  "sinks": "File write operations for pickle and JSON files.",
  "flows": "Input 'path' flows into file opening; data loaded or dumped based on file type.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements; standard file I/O with serialization.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward file read/write operations for pickle and JSON formats. It appends file extensions if missing, then opens files in read or write mode, and uses pickle or json modules to load or dump data. No user input is sanitized beyond path extension checks. No network activity, no environment variable use, and no execution of untrusted data. The functions do not execute or evaluate untrusted input or data. Overall, the code appears to serve as basic serialization helpers without malicious intent or complex flows.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard file serialization tasks without any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It is benign utility code.",
