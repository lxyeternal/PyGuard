  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions for serialization. The main security concern is the use of 'pickle.load' on untrusted data, which can lead to remote code execution. No malware or obfuscation is present. The security risk score should be approximately 0.6, considering the inherent danger of pickle, but the malware score remains 0. All reports are accurate; the overall assessment aligns with the code's nature."
