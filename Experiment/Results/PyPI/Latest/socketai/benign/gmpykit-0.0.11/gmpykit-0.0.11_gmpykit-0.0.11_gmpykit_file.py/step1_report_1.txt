  "purpose": "Utility functions for reading and writing pickle and JSON files.",
  "sources": "Input: 'path' parameters for file locations; Data read from files via pickle.load and json.load.",
  "targets": "File writing operations via pickle.dump and json.dumps, but no direct data leakage or external communication.",
  "flows": "Path input -> file open -> load/ dump data -> close file. No external network or environment variable use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward read/write functions for pickle and JSON files. It appends file extensions if missing, then opens, reads or writes, and closes files. There are no network operations, code injections, or environment variable manipulations. The use of pickle is potentially risky if untrusted data is loaded, but the functions simply load data from specified paths without validation or sanitization. No malicious behavior or sabotage evident. Overall, the code appears standard and safe with respect to supply chain security.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements basic file input/output functions for pickle and JSON formats without malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. The only notable security concern is the use of pickle.load, which can execute arbitrary code if the pickle file is malicious, but this is inherent to pickle's design, not malicious code in this module.",
