  "sources": "File paths provided as function arguments; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "File read/write operations; potential for untrusted pickle files to execute arbitrary code during unpickling.",
  "flows": "Input path -> extension check -> open file -> load/dump JSON or pickle -> close file -> return or complete operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation. No obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic serialization helpers with extension appending. The primary security concern is the use of 'pickle.load' which can execute arbitrary code if loading malicious pickle files. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The functions are benign but pose inherent risks when handling untrusted data. The security risk score should reflect this, with a low malware score (0) and a risk score around 0.6 due to pickle's potential for exploitation. The code itself is simple and safe when used with trusted data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions for serialization. The main security concern is the use of 'pickle.load' on untrusted data, which can lead to remote code execution. No malware or obfuscation is present. The security risk score should be approximately 0.6, considering the inherent danger of pickle, but the malware score remains 0. All reports are accurate; the overall assessment aligns with the code's nature.",
