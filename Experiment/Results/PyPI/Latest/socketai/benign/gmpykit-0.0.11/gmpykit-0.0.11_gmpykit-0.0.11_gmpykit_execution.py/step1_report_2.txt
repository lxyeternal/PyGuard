  "purpose": "Provides a decorator to run a function at specified intervals using threading timers.",
  "sources": "The 'set_interval' function and the 'wrapper' function inside the decorator.",
  "targets": "The recursive call within 'set_interval' and the threading.Timer object.",
  "flows": "Decorator calls 'set_interval' which schedules 'func_wrapper', which calls 'set_interval' again, creating a recurring timer that executes the target function periodically.",
  "anomalies": "Recursive call to 'set_interval' inside 'func_wrapper' may cause uncontrolled recursion or resource exhaustion. No input/output sources or external data interactions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'deco_interval' that schedules a function to run repeatedly every 'sec' seconds using threading.Timer. The 'set_interval' function sets up a timer that, upon execution, calls itself recursively to reschedule, enabling periodic execution. No external data sources, user inputs, or untrusted data flows are present. The recursive pattern could lead to unbounded resource consumption if not properly managed, but no malicious intent or harmful behavior is evident. The code's structure appears intended for scheduling tasks rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a periodic task scheduler using threading.Timer with recursive scheduling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The recursive scheduling could cause resource issues if misused, but no malicious intent is detected.",
