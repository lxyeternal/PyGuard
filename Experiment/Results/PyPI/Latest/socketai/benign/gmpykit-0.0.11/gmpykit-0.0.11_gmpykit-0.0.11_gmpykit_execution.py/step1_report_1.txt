  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator for executing a function at regular intervals using threading.Timer.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs are read; only function calls and arguments are used internally.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "The decorator schedules repeated execution of a given function at specified intervals without passing untrusted data to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The recursive call to set_interval within func_wrapper could lead to unintended repeated scheduling, but no malicious or obfuscated behavior is evident. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a decorator 'deco_interval' that, when applied to a function, schedules it to run repeatedly every 'sec' seconds using threading.Timer. The 'set_interval' function recursively sets up the next timer before executing the function. No external inputs, malicious network activity, or data leaks are detected. The implementation appears standard and intended for periodic task execution. There is no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a periodic task scheduler without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a straightforward utility for scheduling repeated function calls.",
