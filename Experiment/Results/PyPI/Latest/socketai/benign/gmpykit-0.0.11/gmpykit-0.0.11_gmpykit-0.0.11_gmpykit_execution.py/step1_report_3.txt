{
  "purpose": "Provides a decorator to run a function periodically at specified intervals using threading.Timer.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs read by the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network operations, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Decorator applies set_interval to repeatedly execute a function at intervals, with no external data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Uses recursion within threading.Timer without clear stopping condition, potentially causing uncontrolled repeated execution. No malicious behavior or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'deco_interval' that schedules repeated execution of a function every 'sec' seconds using threading.Timer. The 'set_interval' function calls itself recursively via threading.Timer, creating an ongoing cycle of function calls. No data inputs, external communications, or suspicious code constructs are present. The recursion could lead to uncontrolled resource consumption if not managed carefully, but it does not constitute malicious intent. No obfuscated code or malware signatures are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement a periodic task scheduler via threading. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The main concern is the uncontrolled recursion which could lead to resource exhaustion, but it is not malicious in nature.",
