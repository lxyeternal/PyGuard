  "purpose": "Implement a decorator to repeatedly execute a function at specified intervals using threading.Timer.",
  "sources": "The decorator 'deco_interval' and the function 'set_interval' which schedule function calls via threading.Timer.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "The decorator wraps a function, which then calls 'set_interval' to schedule recursive execution; 'set_interval' schedules itself before executing the target function.",
  "anomalies": "Recursive scheduling without termination conditions can lead to uncontrolled thread creation and resource exhaustion; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a scheduling utility that repeatedly executes a function at fixed intervals via recursive threading.Timer calls. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The recursive pattern can cause resource exhaustion if misused, but this is a known design for periodic tasks, not malicious. No obfuscation or backdoors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, security risk=0.2-0.3) are consistent with the analysis, reflecting potential resource exhaustion risk but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for scheduling repeated function execution. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is resource exhaustion due to uncontrolled recursion, which is a design issue rather than malicious activity. The scores and assessments in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
