{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator to repeatedly execute a function at specified intervals using threading timers.",
  "sources": "The decorator receives a function to be scheduled and uses threading.Timer to initiate repeated calls.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or data leak points are evident. No external network, file, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "The decorator wraps a function, which, when invoked, schedules itself to run periodically via threading.Timer.",
  "anomalies": "The recursive call within 'func_wrapper' re-invokes 'set_interval' without clear termination, potentially leading to unbounded thread creation. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'deco_interval' that, when applied to a function, schedules it to run every 'sec' seconds. The 'set_interval' function sets up a threading.Timer that calls 'func_wrapper', which in turn calls 'set_interval' again, creating a recursive, self-scheduling pattern. While this pattern is common for periodic tasks, the recursion lacks termination conditions and can lead to unbounded thread spawning if not managed properly. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious code constructs are observed. The code appears to be a utility for scheduling repeated execution but with potential for resource exhaustion due to uncontrolled recursion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for scheduling periodic function execution but contains a recursive call that can cause excessive thread creation if misused. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious payloads. It appears to be a benign utility with potential resource management issues rather than malicious code.",
