  "purpose": "Configure Python package metadata and dependencies for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from './version.txt' file.",
  "sinks": "Uses version string in setup() without validation; no other untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "Reads version from file -> passes to setup() as version parameter.",
  "anomalies": "No validation or sanitization of version string; standard practice but a minor potential risk if file is tampered.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script that reads version info from an external file and specifies dependencies explicitly. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The reliance on an external version file without validation is typical but could be exploited if the file is compromised. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0. The security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting minimal concern about external file trust. Overall, the code does not contain malicious behavior or security flaws, and the scores are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign package setup with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minor concern about trusting the version file is typical and does not indicate malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent across reports.",
