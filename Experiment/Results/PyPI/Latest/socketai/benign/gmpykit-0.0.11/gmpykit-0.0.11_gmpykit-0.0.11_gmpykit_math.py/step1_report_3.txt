{
  "purpose": "Calculate a binomial coefficient using factorials from the math library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters 'n' and 'k' passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks for untrusted data or external data; the code only performs mathematical calculations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'n' and 'k' are used to compute the factorials, with no external data flow or output beyond the returned value.",
  "anomalies": "The formula implemented is incorrect for binomial coefficients; it should be C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!), but the code uses 'k * factorial(n - k)', which is mathematically wrong. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to compute a binomial coefficient, but the formula used is incorrect, potentially leading to wrong results. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and uses standard math library functions. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent are apparent. The primary concern is correctness, not security.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks but contains a mathematical bug in its implementation of the binomial coefficient. It is safe from a security perspective but should be corrected for accuracy.",
