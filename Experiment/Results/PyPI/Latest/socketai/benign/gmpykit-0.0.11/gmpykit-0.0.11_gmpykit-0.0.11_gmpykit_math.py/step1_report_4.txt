  "purpose": "Calculate the binomial coefficient for given n and k values.",
  "sources": "Input parameters n and k provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "No external data or untrusted inputs are used in a way that could cause harm or leak data.",
  "flows": "Input n and k flow directly into the factorial calculations to compute the binomial coefficient.",
  "anomalies": "The formula used for binomial coefficient calculation is incorrect; it divides factorial(n) by (k * factorial(n - k)) instead of (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k)). No signs of malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The function aims to compute a binomial coefficient but implements an incorrect formula, which could lead to wrong results. The code uses standard math library functions without any suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious constructs. No external inputs, environment variables, or network operations are present. The code is straightforward and uses clear, simple logic. No anomalies or malicious indicators are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious implementation intended to compute binomial coefficients, albeit with an incorrect formula. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The primary concern is correctness, not security.",
