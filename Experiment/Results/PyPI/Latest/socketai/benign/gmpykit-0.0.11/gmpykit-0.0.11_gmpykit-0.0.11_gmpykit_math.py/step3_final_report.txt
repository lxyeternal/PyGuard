  "purpose": "Calculates the binomial coefficient for given n and k values.",
  "sources": "Inputs n and k, which are parameters to the function.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or untrusted data flows; internal calculation only.",
  "flows": "Input parameters n and k flow into the calculation; result is returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "Uses incorrect formula: divides factorial(n) by (k * factorial(n - k)) instead of factorial(k) * factorial(n - k). No obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to compute a binomial coefficient but implements an incorrect formula, leading to wrong results. The code is straightforward, uses standard math library functions, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The incorrect formula affects correctness but does not introduce security vulnerabilities. The function does not handle invalid inputs, which could cause runtime errors, but this is a correctness issue, not security-related.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or obfuscation and poses no security risk. The primary issue is a mathematical bug affecting correctness. The security risk score should be 0, and malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate at 0. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the overall security posture is safe.",
