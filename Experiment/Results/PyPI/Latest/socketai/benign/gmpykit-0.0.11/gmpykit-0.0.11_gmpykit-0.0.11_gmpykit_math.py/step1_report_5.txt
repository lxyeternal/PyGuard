  "purpose": "Calculate the binomial coefficient (n choose k) using factorials.",
  "sources": "Function parameters n and k, used in factorial calculations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted output handling present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters n and k are used in factorial calculations to produce the binomial number.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs a straightforward mathematical computation without obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the math module and defines a function to compute a binomial coefficient using factorials. The implementation is direct, with no external data sources, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. The calculation appears correct for typical use, though it does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., negative numbers, k > n). There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful side effects. The code is simple and focused solely on mathematical computation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic mathematical utility function for computing binomial coefficients with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns.",
