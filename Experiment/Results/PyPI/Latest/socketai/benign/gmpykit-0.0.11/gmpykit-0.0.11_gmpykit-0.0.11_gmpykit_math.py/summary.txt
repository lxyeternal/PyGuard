  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or obfuscation and poses no security risk. The primary issue is a mathematical bug affecting correctness. The security risk score should be 0, and malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate at 0. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the overall security posture is safe."
