  "purpose": "Calculate the binomial coefficient (number of ways to choose k items from n items).",
  "sources": "Input parameters n and k, which are passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data, as the function only performs calculations; no output or external data is involved.",
  "flows": "Input parameters n and k flow into the factorial calculations, then to the division and rounding operations, with no external or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a straightforward mathematical calculation without suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to compute a binomial coefficient using math.factorial. It accepts two integer inputs and returns a rounded division of factorial values. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, external network calls, or hidden backdoors. The code is simple, well-structured, and does not manipulate or leak data. No unusual language features or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic mathematical calculation without any malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not exhibit signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
