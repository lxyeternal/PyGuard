{
  "purpose": "Calculate the binomial coefficient (number of ways to choose k items from n).",
  "sources": "The function takes input parameters n and k, which are used directly in mathematical calculations.",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data sources; the code performs internal computations only.",
  "flows": "Input parameters n and k flow into the factorial calculations, which produce the binomial coefficient as output.",
  "anomalies": "The formula used is incorrect for the binomial coefficient. It divides factorial(n) by k * factorial(n - k), which does not match the standard formula factorial(n) / (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k)). This indicates a logical error but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to compute a binomial coefficient using the math.factorial function. The implementation contains a mathematical error: it divides factorial(n) by k * factorial(n - k), which does not produce the correct binomial coefficient. Instead, the correct formula should be factorial(n) / (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k)). The code does not read untrusted data, does not perform any I/O, and does not contain suspicious or malicious code patterns. No external libraries or network calls are present. The only concern is a logical error in the calculation, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple mathematical function with a logical bug, not malicious. It poses no security risk or malware threat but produces incorrect results due to the flawed formula.",
