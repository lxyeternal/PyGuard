  "purpose": "Filesystem-based cache management with TTL, configuration via YAML, and data serialization via pickle.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads/writes for cache files and config YAML; uses pickle for data serialization.",
  "sinks": "Read/write operations on cache files; no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Cache key generation from function name and args, reading/writing pickle files, updating config YAML, cache invalidation based on TTL.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded cache directory path '/.cache' is fixed but not malicious; pickle usage is standard but carries inherent security risks if files are tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward cache with TTL management, config stored in YAML, data stored via pickle. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The use of pickle without validation is a common security concern but not malicious. The fixed cache path could be misused if environment is compromised but is not inherently malicious. No backdoors or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious cache utility primarily using standard filesystem operations and serialization. It does not exhibit malicious intent or behavior. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified, mainly due to pickle and fixed path considerations, which are common in cache implementations but should be used cautiously.",
