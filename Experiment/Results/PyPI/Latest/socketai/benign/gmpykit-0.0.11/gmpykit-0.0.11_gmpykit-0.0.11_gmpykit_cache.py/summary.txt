  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious cache utility primarily using standard filesystem operations and serialization. It does not exhibit malicious intent or behavior. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified, mainly due to pickle and fixed path considerations, which are common in cache implementations but should be used cautiously."
