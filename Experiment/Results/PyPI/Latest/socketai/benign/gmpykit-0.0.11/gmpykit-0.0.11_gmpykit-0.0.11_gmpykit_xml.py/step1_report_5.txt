  "purpose": "Parse an XML string and extract all text content without tags.",
  "sources": "xml_text input parameter, etree.fromstring() parsing method",
  "sinks": "Potential use of untrusted XML data leading to parsing issues or resource exhaustion",
  "flows": "xml_text → etree.fromstring() → etree.tostring() → decode()",
  "anomalies": "Use of recover=True in parser which suppresses parsing errors, but no malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code reads an XML string, parses it with recover=True, which allows recovery from malformed XML, then converts the XML tree to plain text. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The use of recover=True might mask maliciously crafted malformed XML designed for denial of service, but this alone isn't malicious. The code does not perform network operations or execute dynamic code. Overall, it appears to be a straightforward XML text extraction utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard XML parsing and text extraction function with no apparent malicious behavior. The only minor concern is the use of recover=True which could potentially hide malformed XML designed for resource exhaustion, but this is not malicious by itself.",
