  "purpose": "Extracts text content from an XML string using lxml library",
  "sources": "xml_text parameter passed into extract_str_from_xml function",
  "sinks": "The output of etree.tostring, which converts XML tree to string",
  "flows": "Input xml_text -> etree.fromstring() parses XML -> etree.tostring() extracts text content -> decoded string returned",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code or obfuscation; uses recover=True which may allow malformed XML but not malicious by itself",
  "analysis": "The code uses lxml to parse XML input with recovery enabled, then extracts all text content from the XML. No network activity, no code execution, and no data leakage mechanisms are present. The usage appears straightforward for extracting text. The recover=True parameter may allow malformed XML parsing but is not inherently malicious. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple XML text extraction without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not involve data exfiltration, code injection, or other security risks.",
