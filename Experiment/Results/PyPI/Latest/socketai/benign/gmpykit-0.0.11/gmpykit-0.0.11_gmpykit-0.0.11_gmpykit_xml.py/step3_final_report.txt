  "purpose": "Extracts all text content from an XML string using lxml's XMLParser with recover=True.",
  "sources": "Input parameter xml_text; internal use of etree.fromstring() with the parser.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "xml_text -> etree.fromstring() -> etree.tostring() -> return",
  "anomalies": "Uses recover=True, which can suppress parsing errors and hide malicious XML constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward XML parsing and text extraction. The use of recover=True allows parsing of malformed XML, which can be exploited in untrusted input scenarios for XXE or DoS attacks. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The core logic is standard, but the parser configuration introduces potential security concerns if input validation is not enforced externally.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for extracting text from XML. It does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. However, the use of recover=True in untrusted contexts can be exploited for XML-based attacks, making it a potential security risk if not properly managed. The malware score is 0, and the obfuscated score is 0. The security risk score should be around 0.3 to 0.4 depending on input trust assumptions.",
