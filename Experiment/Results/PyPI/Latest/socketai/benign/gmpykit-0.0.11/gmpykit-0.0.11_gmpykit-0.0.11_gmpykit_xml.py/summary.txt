  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for extracting text from XML. It does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. However, the use of recover=True in untrusted contexts can be exploited for XML-based attacks, making it a potential security risk if not properly managed. The malware score is 0, and the obfuscated score is 0. The security risk score should be around 0.3 to 0.4 depending on input trust assumptions."
