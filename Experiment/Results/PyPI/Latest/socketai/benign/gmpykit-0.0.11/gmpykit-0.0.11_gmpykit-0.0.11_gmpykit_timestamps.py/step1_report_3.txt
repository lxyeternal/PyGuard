  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to get the current timestamp and format a duration into a human-readable string.",
  "sources": "The code reads system time via datetime.now() in the now() function.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs are present; the functions return processed data internally.",
  "flows": "The now() function reads system time; the format_duration() processes numeric input to produce a formatted string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or hidden behavior are present. The code appears straightforward and typical for utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports datetime and defines two functions: now() and format_duration(). The now() function fetches the current system timestamp in seconds, converting a datetime object to a Unix timestamp. The format_duration() function converts a floating-point number of seconds into a structured, human-readable string detailing years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. It performs arithmetic to break down the total seconds into these units, then formats the results into a string. There is no data leakage, no network activity, and no suspicious code behavior. The functions serve standard utility purposes without involving untrusted inputs or dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely utility functions for time retrieval and formatting, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
