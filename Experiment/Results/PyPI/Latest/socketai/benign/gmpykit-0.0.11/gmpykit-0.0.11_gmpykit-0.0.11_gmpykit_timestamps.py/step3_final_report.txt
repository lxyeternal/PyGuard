  "purpose": "Utility functions for retrieving current timestamp and formatting durations into human-readable strings.",
  "sources": "The functions read system time via datetime.now().timestamp() and accept external input for duration in format_duration().",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flows to external systems or untrusted outputs.",
  "flows": "The now() function outputs a timestamp; format_duration() processes an input duration without external data flow beyond input parameter.",
  "anomalies": "Accepts external input for duration but performs simple arithmetic and string formatting; no anomalies or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and performs simple calculations. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data leaks are present. The only potential concern is that format_duration() accepts external input, but it does not process untrusted data in a harmful way. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this benign assessment. The only minor discrepancy is report 4's securityRisk score of 0.1, which is unjustified given the code's nature; it should be 0. All other scores are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The slight elevation in report 4's security risk score is unwarranted and should be corrected to 0.",
