  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve the current timestamp and format a duration in seconds into a human-readable string.",
  "sources": "datetime.now().timestamp() for current time; the 'duration' parameter in format_duration() which is passed in externally.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly sends data over the network, writes to files, or accesses sensitive information.",
  "flows": "The 'now()' function reads system time; 'format_duration()' takes an input duration and formats it without any external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. The code only performs straightforward calculations and formatting.",
  "analysis": "The 'now()' function retrieves the current timestamp as an integer, which is standard. The 'format_duration()' function converts a duration in seconds into a formatted string representing years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. It uses fixed constants for time units and standard string formatting, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The functions are purely computational and formatting utilities, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple time calculations and formatting without any malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no indications of malware, data leakage, or security risks within this code segment.",
