{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to retrieve the current timestamp and format durations into human-readable strings.",
  "sources": "The source of data is the system clock via datetime.now().timestamp() and the input parameter 'duration' to format_duration.",
  "sinks": "The output is a formatted string; no untrusted data is written to external systems or used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The current timestamp is generated from datetime.now().timestamp() and returned as an integer; the duration parameter is used solely for formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses straightforward, standard library functions and simple arithmetic for formatting durations.",
  "analysis": "The 'now' function retrieves the current timestamp in seconds as an integer, which is standard and safe. The 'format_duration' function converts a floating-point duration into a structured string representing years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds, using fixed calculations and string formatting. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation present. The code appears to be purely computational and formatting utility functions without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe utility module for timestamp retrieval and duration formatting. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The functions rely solely on standard library calls and arithmetic calculations with no evidence of malicious intent.",
