{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to retrieve the current timestamp and to format a duration in seconds into a human-readable string.",
  "sources": "The function 'now()' reads the current system time via datetime.now(). The 'format_duration()' function takes an input duration in seconds, which could be considered untrusted data if sourced externally.",
  "sinks": "The 'now()' function returns a timestamp without processing. 'format_duration()' formats the input duration into a string but does not perform any external data outputs or network actions.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (e.g., user-provided duration) could be passed to 'format_duration()', which then processes and formats it into a string; the 'now()' function simply reads system time.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code constructs, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or external data transmission observed. The code performs standard date/time operations.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python datetime library to fetch the current timestamp and perform duration formatting. The timestamp is derived via datetime.now().timestamp() and cast to int, which is typical. The formatting function computes human-readable durations from seconds, using standard time conversions and string formatting. No external or untrusted data sources, nor data sinks like network or file I/O, are involved. No obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward utility functions for handling timestamps and durations without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The overall security risk is negligible.",
