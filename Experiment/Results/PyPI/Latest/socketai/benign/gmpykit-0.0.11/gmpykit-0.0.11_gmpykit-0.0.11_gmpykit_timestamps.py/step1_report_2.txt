{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to get the current timestamp and format a duration in seconds into a human-readable string.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current system time using datetime.now().timestamp() and accepts a duration value as input to format.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data affects system security or leaks sensitive data; the code only performs calculations and string formatting.",
  "flows": "The source (datetime.now()) provides data to the now() function which returns a timestamp; the format_duration() function processes an input duration value and formats it into a string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code are present. The code performs straightforward date/time calculations and string formatting without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard Python libraries and functions to retrieve and format date/time data. The now() function simply converts the current datetime to a timestamp, and format_duration() decomposes a duration in seconds into years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds, then formats this into a string. No external data sources, user input, or network operations are involved. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing basic date/time operations and string formatting without any malicious behavior or security concerns. It appears to be utility code with no security risks.",
