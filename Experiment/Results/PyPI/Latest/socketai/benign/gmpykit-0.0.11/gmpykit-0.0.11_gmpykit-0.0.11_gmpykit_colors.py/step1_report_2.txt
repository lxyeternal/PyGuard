{
  "purpose": "Generate a random hexadecimal color code",
  "sources": "randrange from the random module, which provides random numbers within a specified range",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs a color string; no external data sinks or leaks are present",
  "flows": "randrange generates values for r, g, b; these are converted to hex and concatenated into a color string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors; use of random for color generation is typical",
  "analysis": "The code imports the randrange function from the random module and uses it to generate three random integers between 0 and 254. Each integer is converted to a two-digit hexadecimal string, then concatenated with a '#' prefix to produce a color code. There are no external data inputs, no suspicious code flows, and no obfuscated or malicious constructs. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for color generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves a simple purpose of generating a random color. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
