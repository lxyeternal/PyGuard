  "purpose": "Generate a random HEX color code",
  "sources": "randrange function from the random module to generate random integers for RGB components",
  "sinks": "Return statement that outputs a HEX color string",
  "flows": "randrange generates RGB components -> components converted to hex -> concatenated into color string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns, standard usage of random functions",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'randrange' function from Python's 'random' module, then defines 'get_random_color' which generates three random integers between 0 and 254 inclusive for RGB channels. Each value is converted to a two-character hex string, then concatenated into a standard HEX color code. The code appears to perform a straightforward task with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data flows. It does not send data externally, access sensitive info, or execute external commands.",
  "conclusion": "This code securely generates a random HEX color code without any malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard library functions appropriately and contains no anomalies or suspicious behavior.",
