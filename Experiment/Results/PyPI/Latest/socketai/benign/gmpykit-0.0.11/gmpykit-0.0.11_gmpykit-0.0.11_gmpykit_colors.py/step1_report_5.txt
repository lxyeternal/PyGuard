  "purpose": "Generate a random hex color code.",
  "sources": "The code reads random numbers using randrange from the random module.",
  "sinks": "The code returns a string representing a color code; no external or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "randrange generates numbers, which are then converted to hex and concatenated into a color string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior are present. The code uses standard library functions appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code imports randrange from the random module to generate three random integers between 0 and 254. These integers are converted into hexadecimal strings, zero-padded to two characters, and combined into a standard hex color string. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The use of randrange is appropriate for generating random colors. No external data sources or sinks are involved beyond standard output.",
  "conclusion": "The code cleanly generates a random color string with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is a straightforward implementation of color generation.",
