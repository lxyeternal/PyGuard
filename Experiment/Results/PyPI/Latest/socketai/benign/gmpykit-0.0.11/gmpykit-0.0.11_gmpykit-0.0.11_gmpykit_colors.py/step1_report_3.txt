  "purpose": "Generate a random hexadecimal color code",
  "sources": "randrange() function calls for generating random integers between 0 and 255",
  "sinks": "Return statement concatenating color code; no external data sinks observed",
  "flows": "randrange() outputs to hex conversion, then concatenated into color string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; straightforward color generator",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'randrange' function from the 'random' module to generate three random integers between 0 and 254 inclusive. It converts each integer to a two-digit hexadecimal string and concatenates these into a standard hex color code. The process appears to be a simple, intended random color generator without any suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious actions. No external inputs or outputs are involved beyond the returned color string. The code does not include any obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a random color generator using standard library functions. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malicious data flow, or security risks.",
