  "purpose": "Performs speech separation on audio data using a specified model, including resampling and outputting separated sources.",
  "sources": "audio.resample(), separation_model.separate_batch()",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks or external data handling observed",
  "flows": "audio.resample() -> separation_model.separate_batch() -> return Audio objects",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an audio processing pipeline step. It resamples input audio, applies a separation model to extract sources, and returns the separated audio streams. No external network activity, data leaks, or malicious code patterns are present. The code relies on external models, which could be a supply chain concern, but this is outside the code snippet's scope. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are evident. The logic is correct and standard for such tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of security risks or malicious intent. The minimal security risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, primarily due to external dependencies, but no active vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.",
