{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for processing audio data through speech separation, resampling, and model inference.",
  "sources": "The code reads input audio data through the 'audio' parameter in the 'process' method and accesses 'self.separation_model' properties.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs Audio objects containing separated audio sources; no clear untrusted data sink is evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'audio' is resampled, then passed to the separation model for inference, and the outputs are wrapped into new Audio objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports audio processing libraries, defines a class for speech separation, and processes audio data by resampling and separating sources. It uses a separation model with defined hyperparameters, performs inference, and returns separated audio streams. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The data flow appears consistent with standard audio processing workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate audio separation functions without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
