  "purpose": "Define a pipeline step for speech separation using a separation model and audio processing libraries.",
  "sources": "Reading audio data via the Audio class and the separation model's data.",
  "sinks": "Returning separated audio objects; no direct data leaks or external network interactions present.",
  "flows": "Audio data from input is processed through resampling and separation, then output as two Audio objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or hidden mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code imports libraries for audio processing and model inference. It initializes a class for speech separation, resampling input audio, and applying a separation model. It extracts two speaker sources and returns them as Audio objects. No external data transfer, credential handling, or malicious logic is present. The code appears straightforward and aligns with expected behavior for such a processing step.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard speech separation pipeline step without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs audio resampling and source separation in a typical manner. No suspicious or malicious code elements are detected.",
