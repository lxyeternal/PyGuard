  "anomalies": [
    "Repeated definition of 'is_silence' function three times with identical code, which suggests unnecessary redundancy or possible obfuscation.",
    "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious hardcoded secrets are present.",
    "No network connections, file manipulations, or system calls are made.",
    "Code appears straightforward with standard processing functions, no obfuscated or misleading code detected."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code implements standard audio processing utilities, such as converting numpy arrays to tensors, resampling, converting stereo to mono, normalization, and silence detection based on energy threshold. The repeated definitions of 'is_silence' are redundant and could be a sign of unintentional code duplication or an attempt to obfuscate. All functions operate purely on provided data with no external network, file, or system interactions. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The functions for silence detection only compute energy levels and do not send data or perform any suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a set of standard audio processing functions with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The repeated definitions of the same function appear to be unnecessary and do not introduce malicious activity. Overall, the package appears safe based on the provided code, with no security risks or malware detected.",
