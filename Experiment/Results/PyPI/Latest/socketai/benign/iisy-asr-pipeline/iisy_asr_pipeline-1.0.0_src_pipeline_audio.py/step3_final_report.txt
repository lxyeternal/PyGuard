  "purpose": "Utility functions for audio processing including loading, conversion, resampling, normalization, and silence detection.",
  "sources": "Input audio data as bytes, numpy arrays, or torch tensors; data read from buffers or variables.",
  "sinks": "Energy level calculations for silence detection; no data leaks or external data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input data (bytes or arrays) -> conversion/normalization -> energy computation for silence detection.",
  "anomalies": "Multiple identical definitions of the 'is_silence' function, indicating redundancy; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard audio processing utilities with no network or system interactions. The duplicate 'is_silence' functions are likely accidental. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code relies on common libraries and performs straightforward computations. The redundancy does not imply malicious intent but suggests poor code hygiene.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily utility functions for audio analysis. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The main issue is redundant function definitions, which are not security concerns but should be refactored for clarity.",
