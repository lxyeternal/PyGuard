  "purpose": "Analyze the supply chain security of a Python package by reviewing code for malicious behavior, anomalies, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input/output, environment variables, network interactions, user inputs, file operations",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data leaks, command executions",
  "flows": "Sources such as user input or environment variables leading to sinks like network transmission or file access",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. No suspicious network activity, credential leaks, or unsafe code constructs are present. The benign nature is supported by the absence of external data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The security risk scores are low, consistent with the lack of vulnerabilities. The confidence in these assessments is high due to the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. Overall, the package appears safe, with minimal security concerns.",
