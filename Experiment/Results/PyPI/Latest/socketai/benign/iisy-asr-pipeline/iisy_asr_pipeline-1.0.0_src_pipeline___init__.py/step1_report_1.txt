{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task based on the logic implemented, possibly related to data processing or network communication, but the exact purpose cannot be determined definitively without additional context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and potentially external modules or libraries. It may also read files or network data if present.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can reach sensitive functions such as network connections, file writes, or system commands. Specific sinks are not explicitly identified in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input functions through processing functions and potentially to sinks like network or file system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic were detected. The code structure appears straightforward, with no unusual language features or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is analyzed step-by-step, examining all parts including imports, variable assignments, function definitions, and control flow. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or hidden backdoors are evident. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated logic were found. The code maintains clear separation of concerns and appears to be legitimate in its function.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the thorough review, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this code segment. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose without attempting to hide its intent or perform malicious actions.",
