{
  "purpose": "The code processes audio data for speech transcription using the WhisperModel, including normalization, resampling, and speech-to-text conversion.",
  "sources": "Reads audio data from an Audio object, including audio.data (tensor) and parameters input_sr, output_sr, and whisper_model provided during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Returns transcribed text, boolean checks, and duration data; does not send data over network or write to external files.",
  "flows": "Audio data is converted to numpy, processed through normalization and resampling, then passed to whisper_model.transcribe; output text is evaluated and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Code appears standard for audio processing and speech transcription.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard audio preprocessing (mono conversion, normalization, resampling) and calls an external model for transcription. The model used is 'faster_whisper', a known open-source library. No network connections or external data leaks are evident. The transcription result is validated against simple heuristics to filter noise or irrelevant output. All operations are typical for speech-to-text pipelines. No obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of audio preprocessing and speech transcription with no malicious intent. It uses common libraries and performs expected operations without any suspicious activities or malicious behavior.",
