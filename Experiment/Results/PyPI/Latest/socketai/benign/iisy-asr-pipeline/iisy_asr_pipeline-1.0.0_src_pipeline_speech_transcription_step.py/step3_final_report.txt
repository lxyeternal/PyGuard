  "purpose": "Perform audio preprocessing (mono conversion, normalization, resampling) and transcribe speech using the Whisper model, with output validation to filter noise or irrelevant outputs.",
  "sources": "audio.data (input audio data), self.whisper_model.transcribe (transcription process), decode_audio (imported but unused)",
  "sinks": "None; no external network or data exfiltration observed",
  "flows": "audio.data -> to_mono -> resample_audio -> normalize_audio -> whisper_model.transcribe -> check_output -> output",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code for transcription and output check, but these are typical during development; no suspicious or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard audio preprocessing steps: converting multi-channel audio to mono, normalizing amplitude, resampling to match model input, then transcribing with the Whisper model. Output validation filters out noise, irrelevant outputs, or very short segments. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The libraries used are reputable, and the control flow is straightforward. Commented code appears to be development artifacts rather than malicious backdoors or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard speech transcription pipeline with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1). The assessments in the reports are consistent and justified.",
