  "purpose": "Base class for audio resampling pipeline step, initializing a torchaudio Resample transform.",
  "sources": "Input sample rate parameters (input_sr, output_sr)",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external data handling present",
  "flows": "Initialization of Resample object with input_sr and output_sr, process method intended for extension",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and lacks suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports torchaudio and a local Audio class, defines a class with an __init__ method that creates a Resample transform, and an unimplemented process method. It is a benign, structural component for audio processing pipelines, with no external data handling, network activity, or malicious code. The code is clear, standard, and intended for extension. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. High confidence is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard base class for audio resampling with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The reports accurately reflect its safe nature, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
