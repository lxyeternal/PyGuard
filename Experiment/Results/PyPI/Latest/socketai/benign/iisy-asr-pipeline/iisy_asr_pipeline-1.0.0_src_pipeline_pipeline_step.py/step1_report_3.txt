{
  "purpose": "Define a base class for audio processing pipeline steps that perform resampling of audio data.",
  "sources": "Import of 'torchaudio' library; instantiation of 'Resample' transform within the constructor.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file I/O operations present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the class defines a structure for processing but does not execute any data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard library functions with clear intent. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'torchaudio' and a local module 'pipeline.audio'. It defines a class 'PipelineStep' with an initializer that creates a 'Resample' transform object, which is used for audio resampling. The 'process' method is a stub meant to be overridden by subclasses. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. All components are standard and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a base class for audio processing steps involving resampling. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate component of an audio processing pipeline.",
