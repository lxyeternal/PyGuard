{
  "purpose": "Define a base class for audio processing steps that resample audio data using torchaudio.",
  "sources": "Initialization of the Resample transform and constructor parameters input_sr and output_sr.",
  "sinks": "The process method is designed to accept an Audio object, but does not perform any external data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "Audio input is expected to flow into the process method, which is unimplemented, so no actual data flow occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is standard class and method definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a known library (torchaudio) and defines a class for audio processing with a resampling transform. It sets up parameters and a method intended for processing, but does not include any external data transmission, system modification, or malicious activity. No suspicious patterns or malicious constructs are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign base class for audio processing with no malicious intent or security issues. It lacks any harmful behaviors or obfuscation, and only defines a structure for future implementation.",
