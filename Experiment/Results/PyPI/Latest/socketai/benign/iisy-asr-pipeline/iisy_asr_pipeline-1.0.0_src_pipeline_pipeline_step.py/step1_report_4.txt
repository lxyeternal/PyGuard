{
  "purpose": "Defines a base class for audio processing steps that involve resampling audio data.",
  "sources": "Imports 'torchaudio' library and 'Audio' class from 'pipeline.audio'. No data input/output operations are explicitly present.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling observed in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow logic present beyond initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code features identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known audio processing library (torchaudio) and a local Audio class. It defines a class with a constructor that initializes a Resample transformation, which is standard in audio processing workflows. The process method is not implemented here, indicating this is a base class meant for extension. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be straightforward, typical for an audio pipeline module.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears to be a standard setup for an audio processing pipeline without any malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a base class for audio resampling steps.",
