  "purpose": "Define a base class for audio processing pipeline steps involving resampling audio data.",
  "sources": "Importing torchaudio library, initializing resampler with input and output sample rates.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data output points identified.",
  "flows": "Resampler object used to process audio; process method designed to be overridden.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports torchaudio and defines a class with a constructor initializing a Resample transformation using provided sample rates. The process method is abstract, intended for subclasses to implement specific processing logic. No external data inputs or outputs are directly handled within this fragment. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign base class setup for audio processing, with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
