{
  "purpose": "Define a base class for audio processing steps involving resampling, utilizing torchaudio library.",
  "sources": "import statements importing torchaudio and pipeline.audio modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no network or file operations present",
  "flows": "Initialization creates a resampler object; process method intended to operate on Audio objects but is not implemented",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports torchaudio and a local Audio class, defines a class with a constructor that sets up a resampler transformation, and declares an unimplemented process method. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activities. The code appears to be a standard abstract base class for audio processing pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign setup for audio resampling with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
