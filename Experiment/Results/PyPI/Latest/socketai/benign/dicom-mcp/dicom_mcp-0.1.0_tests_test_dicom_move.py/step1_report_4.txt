{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the DicomClient class methods move_series and move_study, verifying functionality and response structure.",
  "sources": "Imports from pytest, dicom_mcp.dicom_client, and test fixtures from tests.test_dicom_mcp; data fetched via query_study and query_series methods.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input for dangerous operations; no data is sent over the network or written to files within this code.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke query methods to obtain UIDs, then call move_series and move_study with those UIDs, verifying response structure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing procedures, querying data and invoking move methods, then asserting response structure. No data leaks, no injection points, and no malicious logic detected. The focus is solely on verifying API responses and the flow appears typical for testing client methods.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of unit tests for DICOM movement functions, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It does not perform any network exfiltration, data theft, or backdoor activities.",
