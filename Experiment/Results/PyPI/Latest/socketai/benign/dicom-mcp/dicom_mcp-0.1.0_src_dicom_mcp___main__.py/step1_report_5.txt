{
  "purpose": "Initialize and run a DICOM MCP Server based on provided configuration and transport options",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments ('config_path' and 'transport')",
  "sinks": "None observed; no direct output or data leakage points",
  "flows": "User inputs (arguments) are passed to 'create_dicom_mcp_server' and then used to run the server with specified transport",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, no external data leaks or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a command-line interface for starting a DICOM server, parsing a config file path and optional transport method. It delegates server creation and execution to external functions. There are no embedded secrets, malicious network calls, or code that could be maliciously exploited. The code appears straightforward and intended solely for server initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign entry point for starting a server with configurable options. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are evident.",
