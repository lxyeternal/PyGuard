{
  "purpose": "This script initializes and runs a DICOM MCP Server based on provided configuration and transport type arguments.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments: 'config_path' and 'transport'.",
  "sinks": "The 'create_dicom_mcp_server' function is called with 'config_path', and 'mcp.run' is called with 'transport', potentially passing untrusted input to server creation and execution functions.",
  "flows": "User provides 'config_path' and 'transport' via command-line; these are passed to 'create_dicom_mcp_server' and 'mcp.run', respectively.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code. The code does not perform any network connections or data leaks directly. The 'transport' argument defaults to 'stdio' and is used to control server behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script parses user input for configuration and transport type. It then creates a server instance via 'create_dicom_mcp_server' with the configuration path, and runs it with the specified transport. Since the actual server creation and run methods are imported from an external module, their internal security depends on their implementation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling in this snippet. The only potential concern is if 'create_dicom_mcp_server' or 'mcp.run' improperly handle untrusted input, but this cannot be determined from this code alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, primarily handling argument parsing and delegating server creation and execution to external functions. No malicious behavior or malware is evident. The security risk depends on the implementation of imported functions, but within this snippet, no issues are apparent.",
