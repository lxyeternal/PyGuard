  "purpose": "Entry point script for initializing and running the DICOM MCP server, delegating core functionality to external modules.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments: 'config_path' and '--transport' options.",
  "sinks": "Arguments passed to 'create_dicom_mcp_server' and 'mcp.run' functions; external functions handle server creation and execution.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow from command-line parsing to external server creation and execution functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward delegation with no embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI wrapper that parses user input and delegates server setup and run commands to external functions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. The security implications depend on the implementation of external functions, which are not provided. The code itself appears benign, with low inherent risk. The passing of user-controlled data to external modules is a potential concern if those modules mishandle inputs, but this cannot be assessed here. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, straightforward CLI entry point for server initialization, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security posture depends on external modules, but within this snippet, it appears safe. The malware score is 0, and the risk score is minimal, reflecting the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns.",
