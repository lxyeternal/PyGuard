  "purpose": "Main entry point for initializing and running the DICOM MCP Server based on provided configuration and transport options.",
  "sources": "argparse.ArgumentParser parsing command-line arguments: 'config_path' and '--transport'.",
  "sinks": "Calling create_dicom_mcp_server() with config_path, and mcp.run() with transport type; potential risk if these functions handle untrusted input insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input arguments ('config_path', '--transport') are used to instantiate and run the server, passing untrusted user input directly into server creation and execution functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious behavior, or obfuscated code detected. Commented-out code (mcp.run()) is benign but indicates previous debugging or testing activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI entry point that parses user inputs and initiates server startup. It relies on external functions (create_dicom_mcp_server and mcp.run) whose implementations are not provided. No insecure practices or malicious code patterns are evident within this snippet. The code does not process data directly; it simply passes arguments to other components. Since input parameters are directly used in server creation and execution, potential security concerns depend on the implementations of these external functions, which are not part of this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical application entry point without malicious intent. There are no obvious security risks or malicious behaviors present in this snippet. However, because user inputs ('config_path' and 'transport') are passed directly to server functions, the security of the overall system depends on those external functions' handling of inputs. Overall, low suspicion based on this fragment.",
