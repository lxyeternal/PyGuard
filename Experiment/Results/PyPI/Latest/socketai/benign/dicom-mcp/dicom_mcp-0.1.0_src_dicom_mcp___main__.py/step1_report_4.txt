  "purpose": "Initialize and run a DICOM MCP server based on user-provided configuration and transport options.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments: 'config_path' and '--transport'.",
  "sinks": "The 'create_dicom_mcp_server' function and its 'run' method may process the 'config_path' and 'transport' inputs, but the code does not directly handle untrusted data beyond passing it to these functions.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> 'create_dicom_mcp_server' with 'config_path' -> 'mcp.run' with 'transport' parameter.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The 'transport' argument defaults to 'stdio', which is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code is present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical entry point for a server application. It parses command-line arguments for configuration and transport options, then creates and runs the server accordingly. There are no signs of malicious code or hidden behaviors. The only potential concern is reliance on external functions ('create_dicom_mcp_server' and 'run'), but these are assumed to be legitimate as part of the package. The code does not contain any suspicious logic, data leakage, or insecure patterns. Overall, the script is simple and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a straightforward server startup script with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly delegates core functionality to imported functions and handles user inputs safely. No indicators of malware or malicious intent are present.",
