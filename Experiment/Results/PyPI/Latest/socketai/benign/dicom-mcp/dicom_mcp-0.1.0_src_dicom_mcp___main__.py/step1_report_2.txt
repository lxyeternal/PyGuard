{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and runs a DICOM MCP Server based on provided configuration and transport parameters.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from command-line arguments 'config_path' and '--transport'.",
  "sinks": "The code passes 'config_path' and 'transport' parameters to server creation and execution functions, which could potentially handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are parsed and then used to configure and run the server via create_dicom_mcp_server and its run method.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries and functions.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily acts as an entry point, parsing command-line arguments for server configuration. It delegates the core server logic to an imported function create_dicom_mcp_server, which is external and not provided. There are no signs of malicious code such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated behavior. The usage of command-line arguments is standard, and there are no insecure practices like evaluating untrusted input or executing arbitrary code. The commented out line does not introduce risk. Overall, this appears to be a typical server startup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard entry point for starting a DICOM server with configurable parameters. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment. The server creation relies on an external function, which should be reviewed separately, but based solely on this code, there is no evidence of malware or supply chain compromise.",
