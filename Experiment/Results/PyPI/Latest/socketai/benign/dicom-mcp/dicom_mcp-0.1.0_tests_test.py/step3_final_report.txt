{
  "purpose": "A script to test and interact with a DICOM server by loading configuration, verifying connection, querying patient/study/series/instance data, and retrieving DICOM instances via C-MOVE.",
  "sources": "Configuration file 'configuration.yaml', network connections to DICOM server, user console output",
  "sinks": "Console logs, file system where DICOM files are saved",
  "flows": "Configuration data -> DicomClient instantiation -> network communication for verification and queries -> file storage of retrieved instances",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard DICOM client operations: loading configuration, establishing connection, querying hierarchical data, and retrieving images. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. It handles sensitive data appropriately within expected medical imaging workflows. The code structure and comments suggest a benign testing utility. External functions and libraries used are typical for such tasks. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate DICOM client testing tool with no malicious or security-threatening features. It handles sensitive data as expected for its purpose. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the security risk score reflects minimal concern, primarily due to data handling but no malicious activity.",
