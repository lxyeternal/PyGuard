  "purpose": "A minimal interface module exposing the create_dicom_mcp_server function for interacting with DICOM servers.",
  "sources": "Import from local module '.server'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Import and export of a function; no data flow or network activity within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports a function from a local module and exposes it via __all__. It contains no input/output, data processing, or network operations. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of suspicious constructs. The actual implementation resides in the '.server' module, which is not provided, so potential risks there cannot be assessed. Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, minimal, and appears safe. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues are present in this snippet. The main concern would be the implementation within '.server', but that is outside the scope of this review.",
