  "purpose": "To provide an interface for interacting with DICOM servers through the Model Context Protocol.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '.server' and the module's own metadata variables (__version__, __all__).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code mainly defines imports and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a function from a local module and setting metadata variables. It does not process input, perform network activity, or execute untrusted code. The import from a local module suggests the main functionality resides elsewhere. No malicious behavior or security issues are detectable in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module initializer defining a public API and version info for a DICOM Model Context Protocol server. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks.",
