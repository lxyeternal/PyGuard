  "purpose": "Provides an interface to create a DICOM Model Context Protocol server for interacting with DICOM servers.",
  "sources": "Importing the create_dicom_mcp_server function from a local module (.server). No input or external data sources are explicitly read within this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this minimal code; it only exports a function from a local module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual constructs. The comment describes functionality but does not provide implementation details. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports a function from a local module and exposes it through __all__. It serves as an interface or API surface. There are no inputs, data processing, or output operations. The code appears straightforward and intended for modular use. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detectable in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic interface module exposing a server creation function. It shows no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks based on the provided content.",
