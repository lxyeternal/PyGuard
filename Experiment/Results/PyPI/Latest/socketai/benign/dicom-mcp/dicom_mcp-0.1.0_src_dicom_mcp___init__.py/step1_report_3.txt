  "purpose": "Provides an interface for interacting with DICOM servers via a Model Context Protocol",
  "sources": "Importing create_dicom_mcp_server from a local module (.server)",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code is mainly defining exports and importing a function",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; minimal code, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module, sets version info, and defines exports. It appears to be part of a package that interfaces with DICOM servers. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, or malicious network activity. The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module stub for a DICOM protocol server component, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
