  "purpose": "Provides an interface for interacting with DICOM servers via the Model Context Protocol",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .server import create_dicom_mcp_server",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; module exports create_dicom_mcp_server",
  "flows": "The module exports a function from an internal module; no data flow or external untrusted data handling visible",
  "anomalies": "Simple module declaration with no embedded logic, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code; no obfuscation or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module that imports a function from a local server module and exposes it via __all__, along with a version string. There are no input or output data handling, no network connections, and no suspicious code. The import is relative, indicating internal module structure. No anomalies or malicious patterns are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward package component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module interface with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
