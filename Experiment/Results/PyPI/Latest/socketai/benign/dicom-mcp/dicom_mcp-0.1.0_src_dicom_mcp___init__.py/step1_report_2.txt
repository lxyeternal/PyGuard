  "purpose": "Provides an interface for interacting with DICOM servers using a Model Context Protocol implementation.",
  "sources": "Imports 'create_dicom_mcp_server' from a local module '.server'. No input reading from external sources is evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is visible in this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports a function from a relative module and sets versioning and export variables. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or file operations. It appears to be part of a larger package, serving as an entry point or API interface. No malicious behavior, unusual code patterns, or security risks are detectable in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic module setup with no indications of malicious intent or security concerns. It is likely safe and standard for its purpose.",
