  "purpose": "Define and retrieve predefined sets of DICOM attributes for different query levels based on presets.",
  "sources": "Static dictionaries containing attribute presets; function parameters for levels, presets, additional and excluded attributes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, execute untrusted code, or handle untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (level, preset, additional_attrs, exclude_attrs) influence the returned attribute list; no external data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code solely manages static data and list manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static dictionaries for attribute presets and provides a function to retrieve attributes based on user input, allowing optional additions or exclusions. It includes proper fallback mechanisms if presets or levels are missing, avoiding errors. The logic is straightforward and does not perform any network operations, system calls, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are present. It operates purely on predefined data and user-supplied list modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a static configuration utility for DICOM attribute sets. It appears safe, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. The implementation is clear and standard for managing preset data.",
