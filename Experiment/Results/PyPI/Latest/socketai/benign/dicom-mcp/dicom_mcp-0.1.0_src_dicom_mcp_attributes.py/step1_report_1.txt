{
  "purpose": "This code provides predefined sets of DICOM attributes for different query levels and presets, and a function to retrieve attributes with optional additions and exclusions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the ATTRIBUTE_PRESETS dictionary and function parameters (level, preset, additional_attrs, exclude_attrs).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the function only processes and returns attribute lists. There are no points where untrusted data is used in a vulnerable context such as executing code or SQL queries.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into the function, which processes preset attributes and optional modifications, then returns a list. No external data or untrusted input influences behavior in a risky way.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious behavior are present. The code performs straightforward data manipulation without hidden or misleading code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary of attribute presets for different query levels and a function to retrieve attribute lists based on user inputs. The function handles optional additions and exclusions without executing or evaluating the input beyond list operations. There are no hardcoded credentials, external network interactions, or malicious code structures. The code appears to be a standard utility for managing DICOM attributes with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for managing DICOM attribute presets. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities. It operates solely on data structures and input parameters in a safe manner.",
