{
  "purpose": "Provides predefined attribute presets for different DICOM query levels and a function to retrieve attributes based on preset, level, and additional/exclude options.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs; static in-memory dictionary ATTRIBUTE_PRESETS and function parameters",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks or untrusted data handling evident",
  "flows": "Function get_attributes_for_level reads preset configurations and processes input parameters to produce attribute lists",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Function logic is straightforward; no obfuscated or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static dictionaries with attribute names, which are typical for configuration data. The get_attributes_for_level function manipulates lists based on input parameters with standard list operations. There is no input validation beyond basic list inclusion/exclusion, but nothing inherently malicious or dangerous. No network, file I/O, or environment variable access present. Overall, the code appears to be a benign configuration helper module with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration utility for managing DICOM attribute presets. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious operations. It is safe from a security perspective.",
