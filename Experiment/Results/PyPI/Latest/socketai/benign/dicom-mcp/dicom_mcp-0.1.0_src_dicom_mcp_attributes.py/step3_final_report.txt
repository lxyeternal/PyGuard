  "purpose": "Defines static dictionaries for DICOM attribute presets at various query levels and provides a function to retrieve attribute lists with optional modifications.",
  "sources": "Static dictionaries ATTRIBUTE_PRESETS and function parameters (level, preset, additional_attrs, exclude_attrs).",
  "sinks": "List manipulations within get_attributes_for_level; no external data or untrusted sinks.",
  "flows": "Function reads preset data, modifies attribute lists based on parameters, and returns the list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static data management with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code manages static configuration data for DICOM attributes. The function safely retrieves and modifies lists based on preset and level, with fallback logic. No external data, network activity, or code execution occurs. The code is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified given the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration utility for DICOM attribute presets. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
