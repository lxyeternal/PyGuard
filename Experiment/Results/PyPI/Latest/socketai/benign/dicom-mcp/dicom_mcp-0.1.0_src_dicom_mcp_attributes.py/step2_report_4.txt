  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, security risks, and consistency of scores.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward utility managing static data structures (DICOM attribute presets).\n- No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- The code manipulates lists based on input parameters but does not evaluate or execute code from untrusted sources.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The function's logic is simple, with fallbacks and optional modifications, but nothing that indicates malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears correct and consistent with its purpose. No issues or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; the code is benign.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent; no external interactions or sensitive data handling.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 (correct)\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- The reports mention no suspicious activity, and the code is purely configuration management.\n- The fallback logic in `get_attributes_for_level` is sensible, ensuring robustness if presets or levels are missing.\n- The optional addition and exclusion of attributes are safe operations.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present, the scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate.\n- The confidence scores of 1.0 are justified given the clear, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, well-structured utility module with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
