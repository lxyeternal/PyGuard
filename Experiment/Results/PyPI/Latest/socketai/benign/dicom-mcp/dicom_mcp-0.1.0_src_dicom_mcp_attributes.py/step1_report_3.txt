  "purpose": "Define and retrieve preset attributes for different DICOM query levels with optional customization.",
  "sources": "None; no input or external data read operations.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, network transmission, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Function retrieves attribute lists based on preset, level, and optional customizations within the code but does not process untrusted data inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages static dictionaries defining DICOM attribute presets for various query levels. The function get_attributes_for_level constructs attribute lists based on preset, level, and optional additional or excluded attributes. It performs simple list manipulations without external data processing, network activity, or sensitive information handling. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code appears to be straightforward configuration management without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration utility for DICOM attribute presets. It does not contain malware, suspicious patterns, or security risks. No indicators of malicious intent or sabotage are present.",
