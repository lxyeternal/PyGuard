{
  "purpose": "Define and retrieve DICOM attribute presets for different query levels and presets, allowing customization through additional or excluded attributes.",
  "sources": "The code reads preset definitions from a hardcoded dictionary 'ATTRIBUTE_PRESETS'. It reads input parameters in the function 'get_attributes_for_level'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data externally or perform network operations. It manipulates internal data structures and returns a list of attributes.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'level', 'preset', 'additional_attrs', 'exclude_attrs' flow into 'get_attributes_for_level', which then retrieves and modifies attribute lists based on these parameters, returning the final list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external data fetching.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static dictionary with comprehensive preset attributes for different DICOM query levels. The function 'get_attributes_for_level' retrieves attribute lists based on the preset and level, then optionally modifies them by adding or removing specific attributes. The logic is simple, with fallbacks in case of missing presets or levels. There are no signs of malicious behavior, external data leaks, or suspicious code constructs. The code is well-structured and appears to serve a benign purpose related to DICOM data management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing DICOM attribute presets. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe, with no signs of malware or harmful operations.",
