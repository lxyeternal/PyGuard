  "purpose": "Implementation of a DICOM Medical Content Provider (MCP) server with tools for querying, moving, and verifying DICOM data.",
  "sources": "Configuration loading (`load_config`), DICOM client methods (`extract_pdf_text_from_dicom`, `verify_connection`, `query_patient`, `query_study`, `query_series`, `query_instance`, `move_series`, `move_study`), and environment variables (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via `extract_pdf_text_from_dicom` (retrieves PDF content), network operations in client methods (connection verification, data transfer), configuration changes in `switch_dicom_node`, and exception handling which could expose internal errors.",
  "flows": "Source: configuration loading and client method calls; Sink: network operations, PDF extraction, configuration updates, and exception messages. Flows include querying and transferring sensitive medical data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors detected. Use of standard DICOM operations, legitimate utility functions. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors apparent. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious environment variable usage, no unusual data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a server for managing DICOM data, with functions to query, transfer, verify connection, and list nodes. It uses a client abstraction to interact with DICOM nodes, with configuration management. No signs of malicious code, such as hidden network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions handle sensitive medical data, but only through legitimate DICOM protocols. Error handling raises exceptions with messages that could leak internal details, but this is standard practice. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate implementation of DICOM server utilities with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a DICOM server with querying, moving, and verification tools. No malicious or sabotage behavior detected. It handles sensitive data appropriately, with no evidence of malware or security risks beyond normal operational concerns.",
