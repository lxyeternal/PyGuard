  "purpose": "Implement a comprehensive DICOM MCP server with tools for node management, data querying, movement, and verification, facilitating medical imaging workflows.",
  "sources": "Configuration files, external DICOM client methods, network communication with DICOM nodes, PDF extraction modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks during PDF extraction, network communication with DICOM nodes, configuration updates, and node switching.",
  "flows": "Configuration loading -> Client instantiation -> Node querying/movement/verification -> PDF extraction -> Node switching and data queries.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. External modules are standard; no suspicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard DICOM server functions, including configuration management, node listing, data querying, moving, and verification. It uses external, presumably legitimate modules and handles sensitive data over network protocols. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The functions follow expected patterns for medical data management, with appropriate error handling and data flow. The security implications are minimal, with no evidence of data exfiltration, malicious code, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a DICOM management server. It exhibits no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks beyond inherent operational concerns. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, reflecting typical operational exposure without active threats.",
