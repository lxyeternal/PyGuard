  "purpose": "Implementation of a DICOM Medical Imaging Protocol (MCP) server with tools for querying, moving, and verifying DICOM data and nodes.",
  "sources": "Configuration loading (`load_config`), DICOM client method calls (`extract_pdf_text_from_dicom`, `verify_connection`, `move_series`, `move_study`, query methods), environment variables (not explicitly used), and user input parameters for tools.",
  "sinks": "DICOM client method calls which interact with external DICOM servers; configuration modifications (`config.current_node`); exception raising; data returned from query functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (user-provided or tool-invoked) flow into DICOM client methods; configuration data flow from loaded config into client instantiation and node switching; responses from client methods flow back to user through tool outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs detected. No obfuscated code, runtime dynamic execution, or misleading variables are present. No network connections, data exfiltration, or suspicious external calls are evident. The code mostly performs standard configuration, DICOM queries, and file handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a well-structured interface for interacting with DICOM nodes, querying patient/study/series data, and moving data between nodes. It uses configuration loading and client instantiation appropriately. All interactions with external systems are through explicitly called client methods, with no evidence of malicious actions such as data theft, network exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or environment variable leaks are present. The only potential concern is that user input parameters are passed directly into client methods, but these are typical for such systems and do not indicate malicious intent. The code appears to implement legitimate functionality for medical data management without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard implementation for DICOM data management with no detected malicious intent or sabotage. It facilitates querying, transferring, and verifying DICOM nodes securely. No indicators of malware or malicious behavior are present. The overall security risk is low.",
