  "purpose": "Implementation of a DICOM medical imaging server with various tools for querying, moving, and verifying DICOM data and nodes.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules (mcp.server.fastmcp, .attributes, .dicom_client, .config) and functions within the code that access configuration, network, or file system components.",
  "sinks": "Network operations (client.extract_pdf_text_from_dicom, client.verify_connection, client.move_series, client.move_study), configuration updates (changing current_node), and data retrieval from DICOM nodes.",
  "flows": "Sources such as load_config and DicomClient methods feed data into the functions; these data are used in network calls, configuration modifications, and data processing functions which may send or retrieve data over the network.",
  "anomalies": "Code performs network operations including PDF extraction from DICOM, node switching, and move operations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. No suspicious or malicious data leaks or covert channels are evident. Logging appears standard. No unusual dynamic code execution or data exfiltration mechanisms are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of tools for managing and querying DICOM nodes, including retrieving patient/study/series data, moving series or studies between nodes, verifying connections, and extracting PDF text from DICOM instances. The implementation relies on external client classes and configuration data. All network operations appear standard for DICOM communication. No signs of malicious behavior such as covert data exfiltration, system damage, or backdoors are evident. The code handles configuration and network interactions securely in the context of legitimate DICOM operations. The only notable activity involves network communications with DICOM nodes and PDF extraction, which are typical for such applications. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a DICOM server with tools for managing nodes, querying data, and moving DICOM entities. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code segment.",
