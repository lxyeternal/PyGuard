  "purpose": "Load and parse DICOM configuration data from a YAML file using Pydantic models for validation.",
  "sources": "Reading the configuration file from the filesystem via 'open' and 'Path.exists()', parsing YAML content with 'yaml.safe_load'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; data is only read from file and parsed, with no data being sent or executed elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Filesystem read (source) -> YAML parsing -> Data validation into Pydantic models (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'yaml.safe_load' is safe; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious dynamic code or obfuscation present. The code structure is straightforward and does not include obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models for DICOM configuration and a function to load configuration data from a YAML file. It performs basic file existence checking and exception handling during file read and data validation. No untrusted data execution, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior are present. The code appears standard, well-structured, and free from malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely reads and validates configuration data without executing any untrusted code or performing malicious activities. It does not pose security risks or contain malware. It appears safe for use.",
