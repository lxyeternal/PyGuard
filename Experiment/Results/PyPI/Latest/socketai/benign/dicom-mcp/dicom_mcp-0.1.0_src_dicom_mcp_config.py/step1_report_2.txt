  "purpose": "Load and validate DICOM configuration settings from a YAML file using Pydantic models.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a YAML configuration file specified by 'config_path'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is written or transmitted to untrusted destinations.",
  "flows": "Reads file path -> checks existence -> opens file -> loads YAML data -> parses into Pydantic models.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Usage of standard libraries is appropriate. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code safely loads configuration data from a YAML file with proper existence checks. Uses 'yaml.safe_load' which mitigates injection risks. Data is validated via Pydantic models. No external network operations, no secret handling, no suspicious patterns. No malicious or maliciously intended code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, safe configuration loader with appropriate input validation. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
