  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard configuration loader with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the minimal risk of malformed or malicious configuration data. Overall, the code is secure and benign."
