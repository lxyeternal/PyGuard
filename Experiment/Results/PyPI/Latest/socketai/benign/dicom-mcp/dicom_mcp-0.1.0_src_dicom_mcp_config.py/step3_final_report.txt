{
  "purpose": "Loads a YAML configuration file, checks its existence, parses it safely, and validates data with Pydantic models.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration file from disk using Path.exists() and open(); loads data with yaml.safe_load().",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks such as network, system commands, or secret handling.",
  "flows": "File existence check -> open file -> yaml.safe_load -> Pydantic validation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward configuration loading with proper validation and no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs safe file existence check, uses yaml.safe_load which mitigates YAML deserialization risks, and validates data with Pydantic models. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or hardcoded secrets. The exception handling is standard. No suspicious data flows or obfuscation are present. Overall, the code is a typical, secure configuration loader.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard configuration loader with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the minimal risk of malformed or malicious configuration data. Overall, the code is secure and benign.",
