{
  "purpose": "The code loads and validates a DICOM configuration from a YAML file, defining configuration data models using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration file from a specified path via the 'load_config' function; loads data using 'yaml.safe_load'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks that could lead to data leakage or execution; no network, file, or system commands executed with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads data from the filesystem -> parses with 'yaml.safe_load' -> constructs Pydantic models from data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code. The use of 'yaml.safe_load' is appropriate and not unsafe in this context. No suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models for DICOM configuration and loads data from a YAML file. It performs basic existence checks for the file and error handling for invalid data. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed. Uses standard libraries and functions for configuration management. No network communication, no injection, and no sensitive data handling beyond configuration loading.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration loader with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears safe, with proper validation and error handling. No security risks identified in the code.",
