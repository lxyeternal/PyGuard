  "purpose": "Assign a version string to __version__ for package metadata.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a simple assignment statement.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows, external inputs, or outputs.",
  "flows": "None; the code does not process or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward assignment with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard version declaration in Python packages. It contains no external data sources, sinks, or flows. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The simplicity and clarity of the code are consistent with benign package metadata. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and align with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving solely as a version indicator. There are no security risks, malware, or obfuscation present. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent. No further action or re-scoring is necessary.",
