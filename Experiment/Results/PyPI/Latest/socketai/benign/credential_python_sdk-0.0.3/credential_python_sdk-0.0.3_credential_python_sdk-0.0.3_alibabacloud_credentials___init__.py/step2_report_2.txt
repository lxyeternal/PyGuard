  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is merely assigning a version string to `__version__`. There are no functions, data flows, external inputs, or outputs. The code is minimal and standard for package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious intent. No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Security Risk Score**: All assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all assessments agree on the benign nature, no higher risk scores are justified. The code is standard package metadata.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   The code contains nothing malicious—no obfuscated code, no external data handling, no suspicious constructs. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions or Claims**:  \n   All claims are based on straightforward, minimal code analysis. There are no assumptions about potential vulnerabilities that are unsupported by the code.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks present.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code snippet is a standard, benign version declaration typical in Python packages. There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Overall Recommendation**:  \nNo changes needed; the current assessments are accurate.",
