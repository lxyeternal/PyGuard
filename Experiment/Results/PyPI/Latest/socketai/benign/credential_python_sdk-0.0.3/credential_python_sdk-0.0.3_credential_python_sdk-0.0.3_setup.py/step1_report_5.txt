  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'credential_sdk' Python package, configuring metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; importing standard modules; defining package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no untrusted data handling, command execution, or external data flows.",
  "flows": "No suspicious data flows; the script only reads a file locally and passes static metadata to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures. The use of static data and standard setup procedures are typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It reads a README file for long description and configures package metadata including dependencies. All operations are typical for a setup.py and do not involve dynamic code execution, untrusted input, or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, straightforward setup script with no malicious intent or security risks.",
