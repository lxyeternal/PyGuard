{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'credential_python_sdk', configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports standard libraries and setuptools functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file writes, or execution of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads static file content to assign to 'long_description'; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to follow standard setup conventions without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports os and setuptools modules, reads a README file for package description, and defines package setup parameters. The 'install_requires' includes a package 'snapshot-photo', but this alone is not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious code are present. The code strictly handles package configuration and does not perform any runtime operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a typical package configuration file.",
