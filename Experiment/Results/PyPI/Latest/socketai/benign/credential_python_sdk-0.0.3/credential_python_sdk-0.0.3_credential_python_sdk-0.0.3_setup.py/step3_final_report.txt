{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for packaging the 'credential_sdk' Python module, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description; static variables for metadata; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data or external communications; only static configuration.",
  "flows": "Static data used to configure package setup; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; import 'os' is unused but harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script for packaging a Python module. It imports only standard modules, reads a README file, and defines static metadata and dependencies. There are no dynamic operations, user inputs, or network activities. The dependency 'snapshot-photo' appears benign. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and static nature mean there are no security risks or malicious intent. All signals indicate a benign package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
