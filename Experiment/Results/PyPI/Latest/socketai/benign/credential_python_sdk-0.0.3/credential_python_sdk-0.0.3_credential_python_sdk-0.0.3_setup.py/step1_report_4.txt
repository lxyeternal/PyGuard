{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'credential_python_sdk' to configure its distribution and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata (name, version, description, author, long description) from hardcoded variables and a README.md file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no user input or external data handling beyond static file reading.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions; configuration data is static and predetermined.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns present. The code follows standard setup.py structure without suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines package metadata statically. It reads a README file for the long description, then calls setuptools.setup() with predefined arguments. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic execution occurs. The dependencies are listed statically, with no hardcoded credentials or secrets. Overall, it is a typical, benign setup script for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
