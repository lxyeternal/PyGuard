{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package named 'credential_python_sdk' with its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description and includes static metadata variables such as VERSION, DESCRIPTION, AUTHOR.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; setup configuration is static and uses no untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content into long_description, then passes all setup arguments to setuptools.setup() for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed. Usage of static variables and file reading is standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: importing os and setuptools, defining package metadata, reading a README file for description, and calling setuptools.setup() with specified parameters. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior detected. The only input read is the README.md file, which is a common and trusted source for package description. The package dependencies are specified statically; no dynamic or untrusted data is involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a straightforward configuration for packaging and distributing a Python SDK.",
