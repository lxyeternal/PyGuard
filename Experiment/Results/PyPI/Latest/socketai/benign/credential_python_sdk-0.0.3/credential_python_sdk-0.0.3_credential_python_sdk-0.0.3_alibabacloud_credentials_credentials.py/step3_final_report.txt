  "purpose": "Credential management module for Alibaba Cloud SDKs, handling static, token, role-based, URI-based, and refreshable credentials.",
  "sources": "External network calls via TeaCore to fetch or refresh credentials from provided URIs.",
  "sinks": "Return of credential data (access key ID, secret, security token) through getter methods; no data leaks or insecure storage observed.",
  "flows": "Network request to URI -> JSON response -> parse credentials -> store in object attributes -> provide via getter methods, with refresh logic based on expiration timestamps.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors; standard credential handling pattern; optional import of 'snapshot_photo' is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward credential management system with multiple credential types, including refresh logic and network fetching. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. External network calls are typical for dynamic credential retrieval, with proper error handling. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential external dependency risks. No logical flaws or security issues are identified. The reliance on external URIs introduces a potential attack surface but is standard in SDK credential workflows. Overall, the code is secure, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard credential management module with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified given the external network dependencies, which are typical in such SDKs. No modifications to the existing reports are necessary.",
