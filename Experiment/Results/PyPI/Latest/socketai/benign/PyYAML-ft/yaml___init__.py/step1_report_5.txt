  "purpose": "This module provides functions for YAML serialization, deserialization, and schema management, facilitating YAML data handling in Python applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads from input streams via parameters such as 'stream' in functions like scan(), parse(), compose(), load(), and their variants.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data via streams in functions like emit(), serialize_all(), serialize(), dump_all(), dump(), safe_dump_all(), and safe_dump(). It also returns strings when stream is None.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input streams through loader functions to produce Python objects or representation trees, and then potentially to output streams via dump or serialize functions. The functions do not perform untrusted data processing beyond standard serialization/deserialization.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain obvious anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The only notable aspect is the extensive use of dynamic loading (e.g., optional import of 'cyaml') and flexible resolver and constructor registration, which are typical in schema management but could be misused if misconfigured.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily acts as a wrapper around YAML processing classes (e.g., Loader, Dumper) and provides utilities for parsing, composing, loading, dumping, and registering resolvers, constructors, and representers. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are evident. The optional import of 'cyaml' could be considered if it introduces native code, but it is a standard optional dependency. All functions appear to handle data securely by properly disposing loaders/dumpers and do not perform insecure operations such as executing untrusted code directly. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard YAML processing utility module with no malicious intent detected. It provides flexible and configurable YAML serialization/deserialization functions with standard safety practices. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. The overall security risk is minimal, assuming the underlying 'Loader' and 'Dumper' classes are secure. The confidence score is high due to the straightforward nature of the code and absence of malicious patterns.",
