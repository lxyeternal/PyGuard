  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correctly describes the code as a YAML processing library with functions for loading, dumping, and extension. The sources and sinks match the code's functions.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code is standard for YAML libraries.\n- **Analysis:** The review notes proper resource management, no network activity, and clear separation of safe/unsafe modes. The use of custom resolvers and constructors is typical.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears safe, standard, and benign.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (low, justified)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correctly identifies the functions and flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, standard patterns, but notes potential misuse of extension points.\n- **Analysis:** The reviewer emphasizes the absence of malicious code, network activity, or sabotage, but acknowledges that misconfiguration could lead to vulnerabilities (e.g., arbitrary code execution via YAML tags).\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign, with a note that misuse could cause security issues, but no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (slightly higher, justified due to extension points)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or secrets.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the code as a standard YAML library with safe practices. No network or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign, and typical of YAML libraries.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (justified)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; extension points are standard.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a typical YAML utility with no malicious behaviors. No network or sabotage detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Well-structured, safe, and benign.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (justified)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No obvious anomalies, but notes optional 'cyaml' dependency and extension points.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a wrapper around YAML processing classes, with no malicious activity. The optional dependency 'cyaml' could introduce native code, but that’s standard.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a typical, safe YAML utility module.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (justified due to extension points and optional dependencies)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varies but remains low (0.1–0.2), justified by the extensibility and optional dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0.1–0.2** (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- No evidence of malicious code, sabotage, or obfuscation.\n- The extension points (add_* functions) are standard but could be misused if the user loads malicious YAML tags; however, this is a known risk in YAML processing, not a flaw in the code itself.\n- The optional 'cyaml' dependency, if native code is involved, could pose security concerns, but it’s outside the scope of this module and is a common pattern.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code appears safe, standard, and free of malicious behavior. No further action or revision is necessary based on this review.",
