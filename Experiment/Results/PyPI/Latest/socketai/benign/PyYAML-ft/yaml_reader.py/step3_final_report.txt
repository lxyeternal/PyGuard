{
  "purpose": "Provides classes for reading input streams, detecting encoding, and error reporting for YAML parsing.",
  "sources": "Input data from strings, bytes, or file-like objects; reads and buffers data, detects encoding.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network activity; primarily internal buffer and error handling.",
  "flows": "Reads raw data -> decodes based on BOM or default -> buffers -> checks printability -> raises errors if invalid.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard encoding detection and validation routines.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard input stream handler with encoding detection, position tracking, and error reporting. It handles various input types safely, performs no network activity, and contains no malicious or obfuscated code. Error handling is thorough, and the logic is straightforward. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of a stream reader for YAML input, with no malicious intent or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
