{
  "purpose": "The code defines a YAML resolver class with regex patterns for data types, managing resolver registries and setup functions for implicit and path resolvers.",
  "sources": "The code reads static regex patterns, class attributes, and registry data structures; no external data sources or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; no network or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "The resolver setup functions initialize regex patterns; the resolve method matches values against these patterns to determine tags.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code segments detected; patterns are standard and static.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard YAML resolver with regex patterns for data types, registry management, and resolver logic. It does not perform any malicious actions, network activity, or data exfiltration. Regex patterns are well-known for YAML parsing. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward, with clear structure and purpose, and no suspicious behaviors. The security implications are minimal, and the code aligns with typical YAML parser setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard YAML resolver setup with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting its benign nature.",
