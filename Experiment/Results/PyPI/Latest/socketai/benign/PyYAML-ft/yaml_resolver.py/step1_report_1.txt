{
  "purpose": "This code defines YAML resolver classes and functions to add implicit and path resolvers for YAML parsing, including regex patterns for different data types.",
  "sources": "The code reads regex patterns for YAML scalar types and configuration setup functions; it does not read external data sources or user input.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any data sinks, network communication, or external data transmission points.",
  "flows": "The code flows from setup functions to resolver initialization, adding resolvers with regex patterns, and method calls for resolving YAML tags based on patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behavior detected. No obfuscated code present. No unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily concerned with setting up YAML implicit resolvers with regex patterns for various data types and managing resolver state through class methods. It uses standard Python features, regex for pattern matching, and threading.local for thread-safe setup. The resolver setup functions compile regex patterns for YAML types like bool, float, int, timestamp, null, merge, and others, and add them via class methods. No external data sources, network operations, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code appears to be a standard implementation of YAML resolvers with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward YAML resolver setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured and uses standard patterns. No malware or security threats are detected.",
