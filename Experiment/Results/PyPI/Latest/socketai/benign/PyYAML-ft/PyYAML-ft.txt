Its extension mechanisms and optional dependencies are typical and do not pose inherent security risks. The low risk score reflects that, assuming correct usage, the code is safe and free of malicious behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured YAML serialization framework with no active malicious behavior. The primary risk involves the serialization of complex objects that could be exploited if deserialized improperly elsewhere. Scores are consistent: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, security risk approximately 0.2 due to serialization complexity. No adjustments are necessary."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code facilitates powerful YAML-to-Python deserialization with unsafe pathways that can be exploited for remote code execution. While not malicious by itself, its design inherently supports malicious activity if untrusted YAML is loaded with unsafe constructors. The scores should be set accordingly, with a malware score around 0.8 and a security risk score around 0.85, emphasizing the need for caution."
