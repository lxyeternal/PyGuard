  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured YAML serialization framework with no active malicious behavior. The primary risk involves the serialization of complex objects that could be exploited if deserialized improperly elsewhere. Scores are consistent: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, security risk approximately 0.2 due to serialization complexity. No adjustments are necessary."
