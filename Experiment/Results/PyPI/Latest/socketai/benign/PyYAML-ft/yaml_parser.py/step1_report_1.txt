{
  "purpose": "This code implements a YAML parser based on recursive descent, processing YAML streams and documents into events.",
  "sources": "Token input from the lexer (get_token, peek_token), data directives in process_directives, and token values such as tags, anchors, and document indicators.",
  "sinks": "Generated events such as ScalarEvent, SequenceStartEvent, MappingStartEvent, which could be used downstream for data processing.",
  "flows": "Tokens are read from the lexer; based on token types, events are emitted. No external data or untrusted sources are directly handled here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is structured as a standard parser with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a YAML parser following a recursive descent approach. It processes YAML tokens into parsing events, maintains parser state, and manages document and stream boundaries. No external network calls, file operations, or suspicious data handling is evident. It uses standard error handling for unexpected tokens. All token types are handled explicitly, and no hidden or unusual behaviors are apparent. The code does not perform any malicious actions or leak data; it simply translates YAML tokens into event objects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard YAML parser with no malicious or sabotage code present. It functions as intended for parsing YAML streams and documents. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
