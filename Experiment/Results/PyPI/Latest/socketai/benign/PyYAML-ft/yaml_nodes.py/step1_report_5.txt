{
  "purpose": "Define classes representing nodes in a YAML-like structure, including scalar, sequence, and mapping nodes.",
  "sources": "Class initializers (__init__ methods), __repr__ method, and attribute assignments",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data output, network, or file operations present",
  "flows": "Data flows from initializers to attributes; __repr__ uses 'value' for representation",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code in __repr__ is harmless, no active malicious behavior; no dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures for nodes with attributes such as tag, value, start/end markers, and style. There are no input/output operations, network access, or file handling. The commented code in __repr__ is benign and not active. No hardcoded secrets, no unusual language features, and no obfuscated code. Overall, it appears to be standard data class definitions with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of YAML-like node classes without any malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines data structures with no active or hidden operations that could compromise security.",
