{
  "purpose": "Defines classes representing nodes used in data structures, possibly for parsing or serialization.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output operations identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily defines classes with attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code in __repr__ method; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for Node, ScalarNode, CollectionNode, SequenceNode, and MappingNode. These classes initialize attributes such as tags, values, start/end markers, and styles. The __repr__ method in Node is mostly commented out, performing simple string representations. No input/output operations, external data handling, or suspicious code structures are present. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior are detected. The code appears to be part of a data parsing or serialization library, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward class structure defining data node objects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and primarily serves as a data structure definition.",
