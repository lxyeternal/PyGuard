{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for representing hierarchical data nodes, likely used in YAML parsing or serialization.",
  "sources": "Class constructors initializing attributes; __repr__ method (commented out) for string representation.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code is purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code in __repr__, but harmless and inactive.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises straightforward class definitions for data nodes with no active malicious or suspicious logic. The __repr__ method's commented code is benign. No input/output, network, or dynamic code execution is present. The code appears to be part of a YAML or hierarchical data structure parser or serializer. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident. The scores assigned across reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent and appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of data node classes with no malicious or security issues. The current assessment scores are accurate and should remain as they are.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
