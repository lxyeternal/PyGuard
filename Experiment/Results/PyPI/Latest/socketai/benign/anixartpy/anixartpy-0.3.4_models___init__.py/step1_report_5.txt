{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports a collection of class and function names for use in other modules, acting as an interface or public API.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (base, profile, channel, user_vote, payload, comment, article).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Importing module components, then exporting them via __all__ for external use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs observed. All imports and exports are straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes and functions from local modules and defines __all__ for module exports. It does not perform data processing, input/output, or network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or backdoors. The structure is standard for Python package __init__.py files or module exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export setup without any malicious intent or security issues. It simply aggregates and exposes certain classes and functions for external use.",
