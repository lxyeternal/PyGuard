{
  "purpose": "Defines a base class for models that initializes attributes from a provided dictionary and provides a string representation.",
  "sources": "The data parameter in the __init__ method, which is a dictionary supplied during object creation.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; the code does not write to files, send data over the network, or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input data (dictionary) flows into __init__, where each key-value pair is set as an attribute on the object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The class provides a generic constructor that assigns all items from a provided dictionary as attributes to the object. This pattern is common for model classes and does not inherently pose security risks. There are no external data sources, no unsafe evaluations, and no malicious code. The code is straightforward and lacks behaviors typically associated with malicious intent or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard model class constructor with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
