  "purpose": "Data modeling classes for serialization/deserialization of payloads and blocks",
  "sources": "Input data dictionaries in constructors, specifically 'data' and 'blocks' keys",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows; code does not process external inputs beyond data initialization",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries to class attributes, with nested 'data' extraction in PayloadBlock",
  "anomalies": "Reassignment of self.data in PayloadBlock.__init__, overwriting inherited attribute; unconventional but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward data classes inheriting from BaseModel, with a nested 'data' extraction in PayloadBlock. No network, cryptography, or system modification operations are present. The only unusual pattern is overwriting self.data, which could cause confusion but does not introduce security vulnerabilities. No obfuscation or malicious code is detected. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign, structural nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as data models with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The unconventional reassignment of self.data is a minor maintainability concern but does not elevate security risk. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use.",
