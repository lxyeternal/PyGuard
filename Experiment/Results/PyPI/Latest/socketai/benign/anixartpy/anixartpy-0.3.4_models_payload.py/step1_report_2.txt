{
  "purpose": "Define data models for payload and payload blocks, likely used for data serialization/deserialization.",
  "sources": "Input data dictionaries used to instantiate Payload and PayloadBlock objects.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code mainly processes data into internal models without performing external actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries through constructors into object attributes, especially 'blocks' and 'data'.",
  "anomalies": "The code reassigns 'self.data' within PayloadBlock constructor, which may overwrite or interfere with superclass behavior. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes inheriting from a base model, with constructors initializing attributes based on input dictionaries. PayloadBlock extracts a 'data' sub-dictionary, and Payload constructs a list of PayloadBlocks from input. No external network calls, file access, or system modifications are present. No anomalous or malicious patterns found. The code appears standard for data modeling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data model implementation for managing payload data. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears to be benign and intended for data handling within a larger application.",
