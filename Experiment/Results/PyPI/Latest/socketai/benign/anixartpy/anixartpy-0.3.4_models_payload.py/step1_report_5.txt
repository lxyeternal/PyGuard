  "purpose": "Define data models for payload and payload blocks, likely for processing structured data input.",
  "sources": "Input data dictionaries used in the constructors (__init__) for Payload and PayloadBlock.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data outputs; constructors process input data but do not perform dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Input data → Payload/PayloadBlock objects via constructors → processed data stored in object attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. The class structure appears standard for data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes inheriting from BaseModel, with constructors initializing attributes based on provided dictionaries. PayloadBlock extracts 'data' key with a default empty dict, and Payload creates a list of PayloadBlock instances from 'blocks'. There are no network operations, code execution, or data exfiltration behaviors. The code is straightforward data modeling with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign data model definitions with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is standard and clean, serving to structure payload data.",
