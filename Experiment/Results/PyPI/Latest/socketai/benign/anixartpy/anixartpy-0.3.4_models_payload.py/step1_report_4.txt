  "purpose": "Defines data models for payload structure, including payload blocks and overall payload metadata.",
  "sources": "Input data dictionaries passed to constructors (__init__ methods) for Payload and PayloadBlock.",
  "targets": "The data stored in self.data and self.blocks; no external sinks or outputs present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries through constructors into object attributes; no external or untrusted data flow beyond instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed. No obfuscation or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple data model classes inheriting from BaseModel, initializing attributes from input data. PayloadBlock extracts 'data' from the input dictionary; Payload initializes a list of PayloadBlock objects from 'blocks'. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. It performs typical data handling without suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard data modeling for payload data without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
