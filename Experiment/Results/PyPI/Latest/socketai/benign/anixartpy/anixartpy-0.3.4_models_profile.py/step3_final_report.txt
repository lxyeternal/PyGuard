  "purpose": "Data models for user profiles, badges, roles, social links, stats, notifications, and activity logs, used for representing user-related data within an application.",
  "sources": "Input dictionaries during object initialization, reading fields such as 'id', 'name', 'type', 'url', timestamps, and nested data structures.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data outputs, network calls, or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries into class attributes; no external or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The method 'check_banned' is incorrectly defined with 'self' as a parameter, which is a coding mistake but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward data models with timestamp conversions and nested data. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected. The only issue is a minor coding error in 'check_banned', which does not impact security. The import path '..' is standard in package structures. No external interactions or dynamic code execution are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign data modeling layer with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, though the high security risk scores (e.g., 0.9) should be lowered to reflect the benign nature. The minor coding mistake does not constitute a security concern but should be corrected for code quality.",
