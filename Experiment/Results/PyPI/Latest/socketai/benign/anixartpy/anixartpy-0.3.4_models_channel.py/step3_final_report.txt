  "purpose": "API client classes for managing channels and members, including actions like blocking, permission management, article creation, and media uploads.",
  "sources": "Data read from method parameters, API responses, and response content.",
  "sinks": "API response handling, print statements (debug logs), and data assignments to object attributes.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into API request payloads; responses are processed to update object state or trigger errors; print statements output response info.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a print statement in set_avatar method used for debugging; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper for channel and member management, with methods performing standard operations. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident. The print statement in set_avatar is a debugging artifact, not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior. The low risk score accounts for potential info leakage via logs but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate API client for managing channels and members, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The minor debug print statement does not elevate security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
