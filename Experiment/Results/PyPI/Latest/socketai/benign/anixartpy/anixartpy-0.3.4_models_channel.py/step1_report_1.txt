  "raw_response": "{\n  \"purpose\": \"This code defines classes for managing and interacting with channels and channel members in a social media or content platform, including actions like updating settings, creating articles, subscribing/unsubscribing, and managing members.\",\n  \"sources\": \"Data inputs from external APIs (via self.__api methods), user-provided arguments for actions (e.g., reason, permission, files for uploads).\",\n  \"sinks\": \"API POST and GET requests for blocking/unblocking members, changing permissions, creating articles, subscribing, uploading images, and updating channel info.\",\n  \"flows\": \"User input or method parameters -> API request payloads -> API responses -> object state updates.\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"Use of response[\"code\"] for flow control, no evident hardcoded credentials, no suspicious domain URLs, no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present, no unusual data leaks, no hidden or backdoor code. The only print statement logs the response from anix_images.upload_avatar, which might be unnecessary but not malicious.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code mainly facilitates standard operations for a content management platform. It includes API interactions for blocking, unblocking, permission management, subscribing, creating articles, and uploading images. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious network communications are visible. The upload functions rely on external modules (anix_images) and API calls, which appear legitimate. There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The print statement could potentially leak sensitive info in a debugging environment, but this is a typical development practice rather than malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears to implement typical API-driven functionalities with no suspicious or malicious code.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is standard for managing channels and members with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It performs expected actions like updating settings, managing members, and uploading images through API calls. No hidden or malicious behavior detected.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.2\n}",
