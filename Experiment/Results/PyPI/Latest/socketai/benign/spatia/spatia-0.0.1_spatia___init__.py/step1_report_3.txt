  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some data processing or utility functions based on the function definitions and imports.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, possibly from user input or external configuration files, though specific input sources are not explicitly visible.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, or file operations if present. However, no explicit data leaks, network transmissions, or system modifications are visible in the code provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or imported modules through functions, but without explicit external data inputs or outputs demonstrated in the snippet, specific source-to-sink paths cannot be confirmed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are evident. The code uses standard Python features without obfuscation or unusual language constructs. No malicious behavior or privacy violations are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of typical Python functions and imports, with no signs of malicious payloads or malicious behavior. There are no hidden code segments, obfuscated parts, or suspicious network or file operations visible. The code appears to be standard utility or processing code without malicious intent. Without external context or additional code, no malicious or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears benign and standard, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security threats. It does not contain any suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activities based on the visible content.",
