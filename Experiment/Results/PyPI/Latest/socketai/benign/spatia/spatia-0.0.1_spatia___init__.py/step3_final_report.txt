{
  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies, ensuring the scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, data processing functions, input/output points, network or file operations, code initialization sections.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, logging, data output points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user input) to sinks (network, files, logs) through data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, lack of suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no unusual control flow or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate either benign code, absence of code, or limited information. Malware scores are consistently zero, obfuscation scores are zero, and risk scores are low (~0.2). High confidence is justified when code is present and appears standard; low confidence is appropriate when code is missing or limited. The reasoning aligns with the evidence, and scores are appropriate. No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious intent is detected across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code and reports collectively suggest a benign security posture with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned scores are consistent with the evidence. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
