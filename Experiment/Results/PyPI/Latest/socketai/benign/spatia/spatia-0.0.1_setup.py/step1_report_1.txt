{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project named 'spatia'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description, metadata fields such as name, version, description, URL, author, and dependencies from 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data or user input handling, no network or file operations beyond static reads.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow detected; static data assigned to setup parameters, no dynamic execution or data manipulation observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward setup configuration without suspicious code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard Python package setup using setuptools, including a function to read a README file, and specifies package metadata, dependencies, and configuration options. All operations involve static file reading and data assignment, with no external data input, network activity, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a typical, benign setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is standard and benign. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions solely to package the project with specified metadata and dependencies.",
