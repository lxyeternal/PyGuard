  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'spatia' Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, package metadata, dependencies ('numpy', 'scipy'), and configuration options.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> setting package info -> installation dependencies; no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, static code with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script utilizing setuptools, with static metadata and dependencies. It reads a local README file and defines package configuration. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices indicate no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected or claimed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious features. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
