{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'spatia' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description; reads package requirements from install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external system interaction observed.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code primarily defines package metadata and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package configuration, reads a README file for description, and defines package metadata, dependencies, and other setup parameters. No code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The dependencies listed are common scientific libraries. No anomalies or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is standard for packaging a Python project and contains no malicious or suspicious code. It performs typical package configuration tasks without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
