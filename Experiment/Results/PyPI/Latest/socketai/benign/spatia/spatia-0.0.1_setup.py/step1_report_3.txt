  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'spatia' Python project, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file to include a long description.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the README file into the setup configuration; no external data flow or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools for packaging, reading a local README.md for long description. It specifies project metadata, dependencies, and package configuration. No external input handling, no network operations, or suspicious behavior is present. The code structure is typical for a Python setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup configuration for a Python package without malicious intent or security risks.",
