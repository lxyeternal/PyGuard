{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'spatia', defining package metadata, dependencies, and configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for the long_description.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the README.md file into the 'long_description' parameter in 'setup()'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup. It defines a function 'readme()' that opens and reads 'README.md', which is used for the 'long_description'. The 'setup()' call includes typical package metadata, dependencies ('numpy', 'scipy'), and configuration parameters. There are no indications of data leaks, malicious commands, or suspicious behaviors. The code follows standard practices for Python package setup with no anomalies or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely reads a file and provides package configuration details.",
