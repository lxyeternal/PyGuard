{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for processing financial time series data, specifically for converting date formats, building signal dataframes with shifted signals, and computing period returns.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'date' column from input dataframes, as well as all columns except 'date' for calculations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects; functions perform data transformations without external communication or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dataframes through date conversion, shifting, and percentage change calculations, with 'date' as a recurring key for data alignment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors are detected. The code uses standard pandas operations, with no obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard financial data processing: converting date formats to month-end dates, shifting signals by one period, and calculating percentage returns over specified periods. It imports typical libraries (pandas, numpy, warnings) with no indication of malicious intent. No network, file, or system calls are made; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. All functions are straightforward and typical of financial data analysis routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of data processing functions for financial time series analysis. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It relies solely on pandas for data manipulation and does not contain any suspicious or harmful code.",
