{
  "purpose": "Perform financial data transformations including date conversion to month-end, building shifted momentum signals, and calculating period returns.",
  "sources": "Reads 'date' column for date conversions and calculations; uses DataFrame columns for computations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data, network, or file I/O involved.",
  "flows": "Source is 'date' and data columns; flows into calculations of date adjustments, shifted signals, and percentage returns without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard pandas functions, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical financial data processing tasks: converting dates to month-end, shifting signals for momentum strategies, and computing percentage returns. It relies solely on pandas and numpy, with benign suppression of performance warnings. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious elements are present. The logic is straightforward and appropriate for its purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The minor risk score of 0.1 reflects operational considerations, not security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign financial data processing script with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is negligible, and the scores assigned are appropriate. No security issues are present.",
