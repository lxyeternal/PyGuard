{
  "purpose": "The code processes financial time series data, converting date formats, building signals, and computing returns.",
  "sources": "Reads 'date' column from the input DataFrame, accesses other columns for calculations.",
  "sinks": "Returns DataFrames with computed date and return values; no external data outputs or network communication.",
  "flows": "Uses the 'date' column as input; performs date conversion and shifting; calculates percentage change; returns processed DataFrames.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. No unusual code or hidden operations. Uses standard pandas operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common data processing libraries, suppresses performance warnings, and defines functions for date conversion, signal building, and return calculation. Functions handle data transformations in a straightforward manner, with no external connections or data exfiltration. The shifting and percentage change calculations are standard in financial analysis. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard data processing script for financial analysis, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
