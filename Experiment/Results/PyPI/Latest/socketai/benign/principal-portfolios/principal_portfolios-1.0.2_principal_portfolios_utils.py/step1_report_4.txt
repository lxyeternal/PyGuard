{
  "purpose": "The code processes financial time series data, converting date formats, shifting signals, and calculating period returns.",
  "sources": "Reads input DataFrame 'df', specifically the 'date' column and other data columns for calculations.",
  "sinks": "Outputs modified DataFrames; no external data transmission or sensitive data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "Reads 'date' and data columns from input; processes with date conversions, shifting, and percentage change calculations; outputs transformed DataFrames.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; no unusual language features or obfuscated code detected. Use of warnings filter is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to handle date conversion, shift signals, and compute returns, all using standard pandas operations. No code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior observed. No suspicious data leaks or privacy violations are present. It processes data locally with typical data science operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data processing script for financial data analysis with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It focuses on data transformation tasks without any suspicious behaviors.",
