{
  "purpose": "The code processes financial data for analysis, including date conversion, signal generation, and return calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the input DataFrame columns: 'date' and other numerical columns; uses pandas functions for datetime conversion and data manipulation.",
  "sinks": "Returns DataFrames with processed data, primarily for further analysis or visualization; no direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame -> convert_date_column_for_monthly_data: date conversion; build_signal_df_for_1month_momentum: shifts data for signal generation; compute_period_returns: calculates percentage change over specified periods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden malicious behavior observed; standard data processing functions are used.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data transformations for financial analysis, including date formatting, shifting signals, and calculating returns. All operations are typical for such tasks and do not involve external data fetching, code injection, or data exfiltration. Warnings are suppressed but only for performance warnings, which is not inherently suspicious. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are present. The functions operate solely on the provided data without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward financial data processing script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It uses standard pandas functions for data transformation, with no evidence of malware, security risks, or obfuscation.",
