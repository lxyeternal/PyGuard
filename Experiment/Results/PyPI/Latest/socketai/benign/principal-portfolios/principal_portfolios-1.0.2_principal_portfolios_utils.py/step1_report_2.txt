{
  "purpose": "The code processes financial time series data by converting date formats, building signals for momentum strategies, and computing period returns.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'date' column from the input DataFrame; accesses all other columns in df for calculations.",
  "sinks": "Returns DataFrames with computed signals or returns; no untrusted data is sent elsewhere or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Source (input DataFrame) → Data transformations (date conversion, shifting, percentage change) → Output DataFrames with signals or returns.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard pandas operations for data manipulation. The 'convert_date_column_for_monthly_data' function formats dates as month-end timestamps. The 'build_signal_df_for_1month_momentum' function shifts data to align signals. The 'compute_period_returns' function calculates percentage changes over specified periods. All operations rely on common pandas methods with appropriate handling of data columns. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical financial data processing script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It performs standard calculations related to financial analysis.",
