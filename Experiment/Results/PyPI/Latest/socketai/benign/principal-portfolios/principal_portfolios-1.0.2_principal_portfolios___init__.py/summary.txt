  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent with their scoring, correctly identify the benign or minimal nature of the code, and appropriately assign low malware and risk scores. The main correction involves increasing the obfuscation score in Report 2 to better reflect suspicion. Overall, the security assessment is sound, with no evidence of malicious activity detected."
