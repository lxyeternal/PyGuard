  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'principal_portfolios' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata such as name, version, author, email, description, URL, classifiers, and requirements.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools to specify package metadata. It contains only static data with no dynamic code, external input handling, network activity, or obfuscation. All parameters are hardcoded and the script's purpose is solely to facilitate package distribution. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with common practices for Python package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identified its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
