  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'principal_portfolios' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; static setup script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leakage or external effect points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only package metadata and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The setup script is straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no external data reads, no untrusted input handling, no code execution, and no suspicious behaviors. The script is clean and typical for Python packaging. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The code does not perform any runtime actions beyond package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It simply configures the package metadata and requirements. No security risks or malware are identified.",
