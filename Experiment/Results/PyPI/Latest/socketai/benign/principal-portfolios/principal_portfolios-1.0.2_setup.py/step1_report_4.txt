  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'principal_portfolios' Python package including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input; static configuration code.",
  "sinks": "None, no data output or external interactions beyond package metadata.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from source to sink involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious URL or embedded commands. The URL appears legitimate. No unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script defining package metadata, requirements, and classifiers. All elements are typical for Python packaging and do not include any dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads. The URL points to a public GitHub repository, which appears legitimate. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
