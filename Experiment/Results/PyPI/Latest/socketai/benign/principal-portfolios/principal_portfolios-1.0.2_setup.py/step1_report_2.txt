  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'principal_portfolios' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static setup parameters are hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input; no data leaks or dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; purely static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It does not contain any code that reads input, writes output, or performs operations that could be exploited. No dynamic execution, external data processing, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code appears to be a typical setup.py script for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup configuration script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
