  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools to define package metadata. It specifies package name, version, author details, URL, and classifiers. No user input handling, environment variable usage, or code execution occurs. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present; the script appears to be a typical package setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It solely defines package metadata for distribution.",
