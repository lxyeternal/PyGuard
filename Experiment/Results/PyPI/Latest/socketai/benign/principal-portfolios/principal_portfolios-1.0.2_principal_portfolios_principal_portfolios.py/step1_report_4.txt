{
  "purpose": "The code performs advanced financial data analysis including principal component analysis, eigenvalue computations, regression modeling, and portfolio construction for asset returns.",
  "sources": "Data sources include input_return_dataset_df, signal_df, portfolio_formation_df, and optional factor_data_monthly. These are used to read financial returns, signals, and factor data, primarily via DataFrame columns and date filters.",
  "sinks": "Data sinks include the regression_results function which outputs model parameters, t-stats, and residuals; the build_PP function which outputs detailed portfolio performance metrics and regressions; and the plotting function. No direct data leaks or external transmissions are evident.",
  "flows": "Sources feed into data processing functions (ranking, demeaning, matrix calculations). Data flows through SVD, eigen-decomposition, and portfolio calculations, with outputs stored in DataFrames. Regression results and plots are generated for analysis. No external data flow or network communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code's purpose is complex financial modeling, with extensive mathematical operations, but no unusual, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior detected. No code injection or privacy violations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive financial analysis tool employing PCA, eigen-analysis, and regressions to model asset returns and portfolios. It handles data filtering, normalization, matrix computations, and visualization. All operations are mathematically standard within quantitative finance, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The functions are logically structured and focus on portfolio and factor analysis without external network access or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, sophisticated financial analysis script. It performs statistical and portfolio computations without any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is analytical, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage.",
