{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define an __all__ list for module exports, likely to facilitate import statements in other parts of a package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .logger, .client, .core.resources.live_serverless, .core.resources.resource_manager, and .core.resources.serverless.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly evident in this snippet; no untrusted input handling, network operations, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only contains import statements and an export list without data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions and classes from local modules and defines an __all__ list for module exports. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or include any suspicious logic. Since it is a standard module setup, there are no malicious indicators or security concerns within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a module export definition with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It is a typical part of a package's structure with no suspicious activity.",
