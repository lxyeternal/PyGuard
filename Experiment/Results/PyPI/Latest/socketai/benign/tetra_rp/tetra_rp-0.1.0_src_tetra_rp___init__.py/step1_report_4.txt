  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data, network operations, or sensitive information manipulation are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; only module imports and exports are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of import statements and __all__ declaration. No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific functions and classes from internal modules and defines an export list. No runtime logic, user input handling, network communication, or data processing occurs here. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple module initializer or export hub with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears benign, serving only to organize and expose certain components.",
