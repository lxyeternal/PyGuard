  "purpose": "This code is exporting functions and classes for use in other modules, primarily related to logging and resource management in a serverless environment.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .logger, .client, .core.resources.live_serverless, .core.resources.resource_manager, .core.resources.serverless",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no network calls, file writes, or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Imported functions and classes are made available for external use; no data flows from input sources to sinks within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious imports or code constructs detected. The code appears straightforward and clean.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration to specify exported symbols. It imports local modules related to logging and resource management, then exposes these symbols for other parts of the application. There are no data processing, no network activities, and no sensitive operations evident. The structure and content are typical for a module that consolidates and re-exports functionality. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module initialization with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply exports relevant functions and classes for other modules to use. The risk level is very low.",
