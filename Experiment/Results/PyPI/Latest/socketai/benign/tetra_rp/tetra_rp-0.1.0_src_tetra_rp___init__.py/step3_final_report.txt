{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization or export file, importing internal components and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "The code reads static import statements from internal modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network operations, or external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and clear.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup, importing internal components and exposing them via __all__. It contains no data processing, network activity, or dynamic behavior. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The minimal risk score of 0.1 in one report appears overly cautious but acceptable; overall, the code is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module export file with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
