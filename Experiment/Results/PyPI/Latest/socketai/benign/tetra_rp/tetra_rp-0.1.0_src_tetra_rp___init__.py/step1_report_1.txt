  "purpose": "Module exports for logging and resource management components related to serverless infrastructure.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.logger, .client, .core.resources.*)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows observed; code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes from internal modules and declares them in __all__ for export. There are no data processing, user input, or network operations. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py or module export file.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward module export file with no malicious intent or security issues. It solely imports and exposes components for use elsewhere.",
