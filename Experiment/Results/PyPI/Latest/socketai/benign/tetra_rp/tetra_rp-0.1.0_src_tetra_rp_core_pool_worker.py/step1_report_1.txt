{
  "purpose": "Defines a Worker class to represent individual worker entities in a resource pool, primarily for managing worker states and IDs.",
  "sources": "Imports uuid for generating unique IDs, imports WorkerStatus for status enumeration, and defines class attributes and methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs detected in this code.",
  "flows": "UUID generation in __init__ assigns a worker ID; resource_config is stored but not processed further.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The use of uuid4 for IDs is standard and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, creating a Worker object with a unique ID and status. No input/output from untrusted sources, no external communications, and no obfuscated or malicious code detected. The resource_config parameter is stored but not used maliciously. No signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple class definition for managing worker states with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears benign and intended for resource management.",
