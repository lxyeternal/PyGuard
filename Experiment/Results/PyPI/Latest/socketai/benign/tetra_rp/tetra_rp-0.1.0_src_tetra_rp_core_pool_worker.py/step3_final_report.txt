  "purpose": "Defines a Worker class for resource management, generating unique IDs and storing configuration and status.",
  "sources": "uuid.uuid4() for worker_id, resource_config parameter input, WorkerStatus import (typo in 'dataclass')",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted data flows present",
  "flows": "uuid.uuid4() output assigned to worker_id; resource_config stored; status set to WorkerStatus.IDLE",
  "anomalies": "Typo in import statement ('from dataclass import WorkerStatus' instead of 'from dataclasses import WorkerStatus')",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, creating a Worker object with a UUID-based ID, resource configuration, and status. No malicious behavior, external communication, or obfuscation is present. The only issue is a typo in the import statement, which is a syntax error but not security-related. The UUID generation is standard and safe. No suspicious data flows or external inputs are involved. The code's simplicity and lack of malicious patterns justify malware and obfuscated scores of 0. The minor typo does not impact security, so the risk score should be 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The only issue is a typo in the import statement, which is a coding error, not a security concern. Scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.",
