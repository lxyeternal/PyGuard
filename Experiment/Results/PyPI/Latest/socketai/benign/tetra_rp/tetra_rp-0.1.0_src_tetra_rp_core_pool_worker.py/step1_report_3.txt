  "purpose": "Define a Worker class representing a worker in a resource pool, with unique ID and status management.",
  "sources": "uuid.uuid4() for generating worker ID, import statements for uuid, enum, and dataclass.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows directly to external systems or untrusted sources; no input/output operations are present.",
  "flows": "Constructor uses uuid.uuid4() to generate a worker ID, assigns resource_config and status.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Minor typo in 'dataclass' import, but does not affect execution.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a Worker object with a unique ID, status, and resource configuration. UUID generation appears standard; no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. No unsafe data handling or external calls are present. The import typo ('dataclass' instead of 'dataclass') is likely an error but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving to model a worker with no malicious or suspicious elements. The only issue is a typo in import statement, which does not affect security.",
