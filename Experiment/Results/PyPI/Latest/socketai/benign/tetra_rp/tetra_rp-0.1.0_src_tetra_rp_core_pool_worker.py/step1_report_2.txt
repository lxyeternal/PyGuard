  "purpose": "Define a Worker class to represent a worker in a resource pool, managing worker ID, status, and resource configuration.",
  "sources": "uuid.uuid4() for generating worker_id, input parameter resource_config",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks such as network or file system",
  "flows": "uuid.uuid4() generates a unique ID, assigned to worker_id; resource_config is stored as an attribute",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code creates a Worker class with an initializer that generates a short UUID for worker_id, stores provided resource configuration, and sets initial status to IDLE. The UUID generation uses uuid.uuid4(), which is standard and safe. The class structure appears straightforward with no complex or suspicious behavior. No external inputs are directly used in sensitive operations, and no code appears obfuscated or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a Worker class with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply manages worker attributes and uses a proper UUID for identification.",
