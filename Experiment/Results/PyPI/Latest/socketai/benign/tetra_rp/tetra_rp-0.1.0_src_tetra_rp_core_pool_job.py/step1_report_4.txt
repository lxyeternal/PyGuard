  "purpose": "Define a 'Job' class for managing system jobs, including job ID, configuration, and status.",
  "sources": "uuid.uuid4() generates a unique job ID; resource_config parameter in __init__ method.",
  "sinks": "None directly, as the code does not send data over network, write to files, or execute commands.",
  "flows": "uuid.uuid4() -> self.job_id; resource_config -> self.resource_config.",
  "anomalies": "Use of uuid.uuid4() to generate job IDs is normal; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Job class with a constructor that creates a UUID-based job ID, assigns resource configuration, and sets initial status. There is no external input reading beyond constructor parameters, and no data leaks or suspicious behavior. The import of uuid is standard for generating unique IDs. The import of JobStatus suggests a controlled enumeration, but the code snippet does not show its contents. Overall, the code appears straightforward and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a Job class with no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no apparent security risks.",
