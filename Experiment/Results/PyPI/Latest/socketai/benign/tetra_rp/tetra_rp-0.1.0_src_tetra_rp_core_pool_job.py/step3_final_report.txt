  "purpose": "Defines a Job class for managing tasks with UUID identifiers, status, and resource configuration.",
  "sources": "uuid.uuid4() for job_id, resource_config parameter, JobStatus import",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input handling beyond storage",
  "flows": "uuid.uuid4() generates job_id; resource_config stored directly; status initialized",
  "anomalies": "Typo in import statement: 'from dataclass import JobStatus' should be 'from dataclasses import JobStatus'",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class for job management, using standard libraries. It generates a UUID for job_id, stores resource configuration, and tracks status. No external network calls, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The only technical flaw is a typo in the import statement, which would cause a runtime error but is not malicious. The code does not perform any malicious actions, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1) due to the typo. The code is benign and safe for supply chain use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only issue is a typo in the import statement, which is a coding error, not a security risk. Scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.",
