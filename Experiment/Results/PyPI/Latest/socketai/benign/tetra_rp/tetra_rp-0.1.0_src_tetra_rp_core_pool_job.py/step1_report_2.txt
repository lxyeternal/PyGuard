  "purpose": "Define a Job class to represent tasks within a system, including job ID, resource configuration, and status.",
  "sources": "uuid.uuid4() for generating a unique job ID, importing JobStatus for setting initial job state, resource_config parameter for configuration data.",
  "sinks": "uuid.uuid4() generates a UUID; no other data sinks or external communication present.",
  "flows": "uuid.uuid4() generates a UUID assigned to job_id; resource_config input is stored internally but not used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines a Job class with a constructor that assigns a UUID-based job ID, initial status, and stores provided resource configuration. No external network communication, data leakage, or suspicious behavior detected. The use of uuid4() is typical for generating unique IDs. The code structure and imports do not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a Job class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions to create job objects with unique IDs and tracks their status. No security concerns are evident.",
