  "purpose": "Define a Job class representing a task with unique ID, status, and configuration in a job processing system.",
  "sources": "uuid.uuid4() generating a unique job ID, resource_config input parameter.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no use of untrusted input in a risky way, no data leaks, no external calls, no system modifications.",
  "flows": "uuid.uuid4() generates a new UUID as job ID; resource_config is stored as-is; status is set to an enum value.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class for job representation with a UUID-based ID and configuration storage. UUID generation is standard and secure. The resource_config is stored directly without validation, but this alone is not suspicious. No external network calls, file manipulations, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be a standard implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign class definition for job management with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
