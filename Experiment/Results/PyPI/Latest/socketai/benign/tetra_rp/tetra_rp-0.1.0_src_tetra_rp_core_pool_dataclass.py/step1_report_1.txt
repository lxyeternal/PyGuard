  "purpose": "Define enumerations for worker and job statuses",
  "sources": "Importing uuid module (not used in the code), Enum class from enum module",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data output, network communication, or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flows or data handling paths, just class definitions",
  "anomalies": "Import of uuid module is unused, which might indicate incomplete code or potential for future use; no malicious or suspicious code behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Enum classes for tracking worker and job statuses, which is standard. The uuid module is imported but not used, which is benign but might suggest incomplete implementation. There are no dynamic code execution, data handling, or security-sensitive operations present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be straightforward enumeration definitions with no malicious intent. The unused import of uuid is harmless but might be unnecessary. Overall, the code is benign.",
