  "purpose": "Define enumerations for worker and job statuses in a system, likely used for process or task management.",
  "sources": "Importing uuid (though unused), and reading from Enum definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code only defines enums with string values.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; enums are static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The uuid import is unused, which might indicate incomplete code or redundancy, but this is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Enum classes for worker and job statuses with clear, fixed string values. There are no input or output operations, no data processing, and no handling of external data. The unused uuid import could suggest incomplete or placeholder code, but it does not pose a security risk or malicious behavior. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward and safe definition of status enums with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
