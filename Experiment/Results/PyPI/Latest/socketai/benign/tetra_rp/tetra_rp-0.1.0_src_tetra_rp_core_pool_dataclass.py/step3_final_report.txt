  "purpose": "Define enums for worker and job statuses using string values.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only static enum definitions and an imported module (`uuid`) that is unused.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only declares enums.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of `uuid` module; no other anomalies present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Enum classes with string values, representing worker and job statuses. The `uuid` module is imported but not utilized, indicating a minor oversight. There are no dynamic behaviors, input/output operations, network activity, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward, with no malicious patterns or suspicious constructs. The unused import does not impact security but is a minor code smell. No evidence of malicious intent, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior. The only minor concern is the unused `uuid` import, which does not pose a security risk. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1 due to the minor unused import. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
