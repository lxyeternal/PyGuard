  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks, as code only defines enums",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard enum usage",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'uuid' but does not utilize it, which is unusual but not malicious. The enums are simple and only define static string values for statuses. No input reading, no data processing, no network operations, and no potential data leaks or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines status enums with no malicious intent or security risks. The unused 'uuid' import is a minor anomaly but not suspicious. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
