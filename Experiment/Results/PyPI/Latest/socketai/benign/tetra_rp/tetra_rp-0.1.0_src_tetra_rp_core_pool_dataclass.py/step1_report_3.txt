{
  "purpose": "Defines enums for worker and job statuses, likely for use in a task management system.",
  "sources": "Imports uuid (unused), and Enum class from enum module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data processing involving untrusted input present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code consists solely of enum class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of uuid, but no malicious or suspicious code behavior or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code declares two enum classes with status labels, which are standard constructs. The uuid import is unused, indicating either incomplete code or unnecessary import, but this alone does not suggest malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, data leakage, or suspicious patterns observed. The code is straightforward and lacks any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple enum definitions with an unnecessary import. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
