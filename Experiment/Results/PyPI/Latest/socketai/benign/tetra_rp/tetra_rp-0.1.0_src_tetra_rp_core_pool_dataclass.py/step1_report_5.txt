  "purpose": "Define enumerations for worker and job statuses in a system",
  "sources": "Importing uuid module (not used), defining Enum classes",
  "sinks": "No sinks present, no data processing or output functions",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output; code only declares enums",
  "anomalies": "Import of uuid module which is not used; no other anomalies observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Enum classes representing worker and job statuses. The uuid import is unused, which could be a remnant or placeholder but does not affect security. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or external data sources. No suspicious behavior, code injection, or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward definition of enums with an unused import. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
