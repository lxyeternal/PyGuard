  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score (~0.1) is justified due to minimal exposure through print statements and reliance on external trusted components. Malware score remains at 0, and obfuscation score at 0. Consistent with the analysis, the overall assessment indicates a safe, standard cluster management script."
