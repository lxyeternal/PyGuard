{
  "purpose": "The code manages a cluster of workers and submits jobs based on resource requirements, including adding workers and retrying job scheduling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the ClusterManager class methods: submit_job, get_job_status, add_worker, retry_queued_jobs, list_workers.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that lead to data leaks or untrusted actions; the code primarily interacts with the ClusterManager API and prints status messages.",
  "flows": "Input data (resource configurations and job IDs) flows into cluster management methods; the results (job statuses, worker info) are retrieved via getter methods and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code appears straightforward and relies on an external class for functionality.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a ClusterManager instance, submits jobs with specific resource requirements, adds workers with matching or mismatching resources, and retries scheduling. All actions are typical for cluster management scripts. No malicious code, hidden behavior, or suspicious patterns are identified. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. It simply orchestrates and monitors job scheduling via the ClusterManager class, which is assumed to be a trusted external component.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard cluster job management script without malicious intent or security risks. It interacts with an external cluster management library and performs expected operations without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
