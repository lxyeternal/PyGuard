{
  "purpose": "The code manages a cluster of workers and jobs, submitting jobs, adding workers, and checking statuses.",
  "sources": "Data sources include user input for resource configurations and internal method calls (e.g., submit_job, add_worker, get_job_status, list_workers).",
  "sinks": "Data sinks include print statements and method calls that may output job or worker statuses.",
  "flows": "Input data (resource_config) flows into job submission and worker addition; status checks flow from internal methods to output; no untrusted data directly influences sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard class methods and simple data structures without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a ClusterManager instance and performs job submissions and worker additions with specific resource configurations. It checks job statuses before and after adding matching or non-matching workers, and finally lists worker details. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a straightforward orchestration script for cluster management, relying on external library 'cluster_manager'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign cluster management script with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It only interacts with the ClusterManager API and outputs status information. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident.",
