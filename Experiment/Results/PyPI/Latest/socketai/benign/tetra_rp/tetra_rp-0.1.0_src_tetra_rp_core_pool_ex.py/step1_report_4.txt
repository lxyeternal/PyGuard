{
  "purpose": "The code manages job submission and worker management in a cluster environment, demonstrating scheduling logic based on resource configurations.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include job submissions with resource configurations and worker additions with resource configurations.",
  "sinks": "No data is sent to external systems, networks, or files. No untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from job and worker resource configurations into scheduling logic, but these are internal and controlled flows; no external or insecure data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code appears to be straightforward cluster management logic.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a ClusterManager object and performs a sequence of job submissions and worker additions, with status checks and prints. All data inputs are static, controlled, and related solely to resource configuration parameters. There is no indication of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious intent. The code does not perform any network communication, file manipulation, or execute untrusted input. The usage appears typical for cluster job management without any obfuscated code or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cluster management script demonstrating job scheduling and worker management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present in this code snippet.",
