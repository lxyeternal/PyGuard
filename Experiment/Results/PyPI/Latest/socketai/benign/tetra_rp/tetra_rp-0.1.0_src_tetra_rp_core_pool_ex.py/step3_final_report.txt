  "purpose": "Manage cluster jobs and workers via the ClusterManager class, submitting jobs, adding workers, retrying scheduling, and checking statuses.",
  "sources": "Method calls to ClusterManager: submit_job, add_worker, retry_queued_jobs, get_job_status, list_workers",
  "sinks": "Print statements for status outputs; no untrusted data sinks or external data leaks detected",
  "flows": "Input resource configurations -> ClusterManager methods -> job and worker status updates -> print outputs",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; straightforward logic",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple orchestration script managing jobs and workers through an external ClusterManager class. It performs typical cluster management tasks without network activity, data leaks, or malicious code. The code's structure is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or suspicious behavior. External dependency trust is assumed but not evidenced as malicious. The print statements are standard for status monitoring. No vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score (~0.1) is justified due to minimal exposure through print statements and reliance on external trusted components. Malware score remains at 0, and obfuscation score at 0. Consistent with the analysis, the overall assessment indicates a safe, standard cluster management script.",
