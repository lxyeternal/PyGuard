{
  "purpose": "The code manages workers and jobs within a cluster, including adding/removing workers, submitting jobs, scheduling, and executing them.",
  "sources": "User-provided resource_config dictionaries when adding workers or submitting jobs.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of jobs to workers, execution simulation, and logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Resource configuration input → worker/job creation → scheduling decision → assignment to worker → job execution simulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code primarily contains standard management logic. No suspicious network connections, data exfiltration, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs cluster management operations: creating and removing workers, submitting and scheduling jobs, and simulating job execution. It uses standard Python modules and practices. No use of untrusted input directly affecting security-sensitive operations, nor does it include network calls to external domains or system modifications. The resource_config dictionaries are used to match workers and jobs but are not shown to contain sensitive info. Logging is for operational purposes. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or malware behavior. The overall structure appears typical for such management systems. No obfuscated code or suspicious flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard cluster and job management implementation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It manages resources and jobs through in-memory data structures with typical control flow, and no suspicious activity is evident.",
