  "purpose": "Set up logging configuration for a Python application, including default handlers, formatting, and dynamic log level setting.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LOG_LEVEL' for log level override, system streams (sys.stdout), call stack inspection for caller module name.",
  "sinks": "Logging system output (console/stream), environment variable affecting log level.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'LOG_LEVEL' influences logger level; get_logger() inspects call stack to determine caller module for logging.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. Usage of inspect to determine caller module is standard but can be slightly unusual in dynamic logging setups, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logging configuration with optional custom format and level, based on function parameters and environment variables. It employs inspect to determine caller module name dynamically if no name is provided to get_logger. The setup_logging function avoids adding duplicate handlers. Environment variable 'LOG_LEVEL' is used to override the logging level at runtime. All operations are standard logging practices with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward logging setup with no malicious or suspicious features. It uses common Python modules and techniques for configurable logging. No malware or security risks are detected.",
