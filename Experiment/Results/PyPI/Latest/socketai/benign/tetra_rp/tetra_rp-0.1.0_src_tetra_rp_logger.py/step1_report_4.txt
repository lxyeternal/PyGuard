  "purpose": "Set up and retrieve loggers with configurable log levels and formatting.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LOG_LEVEL' for log level; inspect.stack() for caller module name.",
  "sinks": "Logging output to standard output stream; no data sinks that leak data externally.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'LOG_LEVEL' influences logger level; get_logger uses inspect to determine caller's module.",
  "anomalies": "Use of inspect.stack() to determine caller module could be misused for debugging, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes logging configuration, allowing dynamic level setting via environment variables. The get_logger function infers the caller module if no name is provided. No external network connections, file modifications, or suspicious data leaks are present. No hardcoded credentials or secret data. The code appears to be standard logging setup, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely manages logging configuration and retrieval, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It functions as a typical utility module for logging setup.",
