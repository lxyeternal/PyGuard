{
  "purpose": "Configure and retrieve Python loggers with customizable formatting and levels, with environment variable override.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LOG_LEVEL' for log level override; function parameters for level, stream, and format.",
  "sinks": "Logging output streams; no direct untrusted data sink present.",
  "flows": "Environment variable influences log level; get_logger may access caller's module name; logs are output via stream handler.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns observed. No obfuscation or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions for setting up logging configurations and retrieving loggers, with environment variable support for log level. It uses standard library functions and practices for logging setup, including inspecting the call stack to infer caller module names. There are no signs of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and follows typical patterns for logging configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging setup module with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply configures logging behavior based on parameters and environment variables, with no harmful or suspicious functionality.",
