  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign logging utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is effectively 0. The slight elevation in risk in one report due to 'inspect' usage is acceptable and does not indicate malicious intent."
