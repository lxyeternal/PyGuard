  "purpose": "The code appears to be a sample or template script intended for demonstration or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly present; no explicit input functions or data reads are detected.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious or insecure data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks identified; code executes static operations without data dependency.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated sections, or unusual language features. It appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script performs basic, standard operations without external input handling or risky functions. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. It is either a minimal sample or a boilerplate code snippet. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are present. The absence of network activity, data leaks, or insecure code constructs suggests low risk.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign and safe for use.",
