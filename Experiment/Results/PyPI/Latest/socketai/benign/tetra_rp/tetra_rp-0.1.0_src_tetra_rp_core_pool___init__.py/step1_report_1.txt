  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs some computational or data processing task, but the specific purpose is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input sources could include environment variables, external files, or user inputs if present; however, the provided code does not explicitly read from these sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls, but the code does not demonstrate any such actions.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are evident within the code, suggesting no data leakage or malicious data propagation.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated or misleading variable names are present. No use of dynamic code execution or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the code shows standard syntax and structure with no signs of malicious intent. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious imports, or suspicious control flows were identified. Usage of libraries appears legitimate, and the logic seems to serve its intended purpose without malicious side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in the provided code. It appears to be a benign Python script with no indicators of malware or malicious intent.",
