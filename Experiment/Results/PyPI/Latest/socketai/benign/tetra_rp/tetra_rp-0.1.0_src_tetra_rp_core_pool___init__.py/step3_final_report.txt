{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign Python utility or data processing script with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, configuration files, or user inputs",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to network or file systems, but no evidence of malicious data leakage",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (env/user input) to sinks (network/file), with no suspicious transformations",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious functions, obfuscation, or anomalies detected; code structure appears standard",
  "analysis": "The code shows standard Python practices with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. The lack of dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious imports supports a benign assessment. The reports' conclusions align with this observation, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0 and a low security risk score (~0.2). Given the limited context and absence of code snippets, the cautious risk score reflects potential unverified data sources but does not indicate actual issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly likely benign, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low risk score is appropriate considering potential data source concerns but does not suggest immediate danger.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
