{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to test the functionality of saliency metrics (ssim, psnr, emd) by generating random maps and comparing them.",
  "sources": "Reads no external input; generates random numpy arrays internally.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code merely performs computations on internally generated data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The code appears straightforward, primarily used for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script imports saliency metrics and numpy, then defines a test function that creates random saliency and ground truth maps, and computes metrics between them. There are no inputs from external sources, no network activity, no file I/O, and no manipulation of environment variables. The metrics are used for comparison only within the test function. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign test script for saliency metric functions. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is negligible.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
