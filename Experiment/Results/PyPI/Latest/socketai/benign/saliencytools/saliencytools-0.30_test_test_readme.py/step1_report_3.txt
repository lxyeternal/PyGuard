{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for testing saliency map metrics such as SSIM, PSNR, and EMD using randomly generated data.",
  "sources": "Random data generation for saliency and ground truth maps; import statements from saliencytools and numpy.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow leading to potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Randomly generated saliency and ground truth maps are compared using metric functions, with no external data or untrusted input handling beyond internal random data creation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior detected; the code performs straightforward testing of metrics.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from saliencytools, generates random numpy arrays to simulate saliency maps and ground truth data, and iterates over a list of metric functions to compute similarity measures. The process is for testing or validation purposes only, with no data exfiltration, malicious commands, or obfuscation present. No secrets or credentials are handled, and no external network activity occurs. The code is simple, self-contained, and typical for test scripts.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code. It functions solely as a test utility for saliency metrics with no suspicious activity detected.",
