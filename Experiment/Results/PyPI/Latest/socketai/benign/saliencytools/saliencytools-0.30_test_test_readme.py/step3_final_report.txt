  "purpose": "Test function for computing saliency metrics between randomly generated maps",
  "sources": "Generation of random numpy arrays for saliency and ground truth maps",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external data handling",
  "flows": "Generated arrays are passed directly to metric functions without external influence",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports metric functions, creates synthetic data, and computes metrics in a loop. It performs no external input/output, network activity, or sensitive data handling. The code is simple, clear, and solely for testing purposes. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assess its safety. The only minor inconsistency is the security risk score of 0.1 in one report, which should be adjusted to 0. Given the straightforward, testing-oriented nature, the overall security assessment is that the code poses no threat.",
