{
  "purpose": "The code appears to test saliency metrics (ssim, psnr, emd) by generating random maps and computing their similarity scores.",
  "sources": "Reads none from external sources; uses internally generated random numpy arrays.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data affects system security; only computes metric functions.",
  "flows": "Generates random data -> computes similarity metrics; no data flow to external systems or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation; straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports saliency metrics and numpy, then defines a function to generate random saliency and ground truth maps, and computes similarity scores. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It simply tests metric functions with synthetic data. No external data, user input, or system modifications are involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, intended solely for testing saliency metric functions with randomly generated data. It poses no security risk or malicious intent.",
