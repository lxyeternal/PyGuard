{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test function for evaluating saliency maps against ground truth using metrics like SSIM, PSNR, and EMD.",
  "sources": "Reads randomly generated numpy arrays as input data for metrics calculation.",
  "sinks": "Outputs results of metric calculations as formatted strings, but does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Generates random data -> computes metrics -> formats output string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Uses standard scientific libraries and functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific image similarity metrics and numpy for data manipulation. It defines a test function that creates random matrices to simulate saliency and ground truth maps. It then calculates and formats the results of three metrics on these matrices. There are no indications of malicious code, external network activity, or obfuscation. The data generated are purely synthetic for testing purposes. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected in the code structure, flow, or content.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test script for saliency map metrics, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply performs standard data processing and metric computation.",
