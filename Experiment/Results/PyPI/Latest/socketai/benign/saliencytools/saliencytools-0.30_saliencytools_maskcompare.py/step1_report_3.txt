{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for comparing saliency maps using various similarity and distance metrics, including normalization, and standard image similarity measures.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input numpy.ndarray saliency maps passed to functions such as normalize_mask, normalize_mask_0_1, clip_mask, and various metric functions like emd, mae, jaccard_index, etc.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak if input saliency maps are sourced from untrusted or malicious inputs; no code explicitly writes to external files, network, or system. No sensitive data is stored or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input saliency maps through normalization functions, then into various metric functions which compute similarity/distance measures. No external or system interaction observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. All functions perform standard mathematical operations for comparison metrics. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors detected. No dynamic code execution, no network calls, no file I/O, and no command execution.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard normalization functions and well-known image similarity/distance metrics, with clear and appropriate implementations. No code injections, dynamic execution, or suspicious operations are present. The functions rely on numpy, scipy, and skimage, which are typical in image processing tasks. The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials or system manipulation. All calculations are mathematically sound, and no external communication or data exfiltration mechanisms are implemented.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign library for saliency map comparison, implementing standard and well-understood metrics without any malicious intent or malicious behavior. No signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks are detected.",
