{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions to compare saliency maps using various similarity and distance metrics, including normalization, clipping, and multiple standard image comparison measures.",
  "sources": "Functions receive numpy.ndarray inputs representing saliency maps; no external data sources or I/O are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or transmitted; functions operate solely on provided numpy arrays, with no external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Input saliency maps are normalized or clipped, then compared via metrics such as MSE, SSIM, IoU, etc., with no external data flow or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "The 'sign_agreement_ratio' function appears to compute disagreement rather than agreement, which is inconsistent with its name; this is a logical flaw but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard normalization, clipping, and similarity/distance metrics for images, relying on common scientific libraries. No obfuscation, malicious routines, or external system interactions are present. Minor issues include potential division by zero in normalization functions and a logical inconsistency in 'sign_agreement_ratio'. These do not pose security risks but should be addressed for robustness and correctness. Overall, the code is benign, well-documented, and appropriate for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for saliency map comparison with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
