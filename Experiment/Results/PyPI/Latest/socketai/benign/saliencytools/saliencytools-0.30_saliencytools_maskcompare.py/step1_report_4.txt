{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to compare saliency maps using various metrics and distance measures for image analysis and evaluation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input saliency maps through function parameters, and uses imported libraries such as numpy, torch, skimage.metrics, and scipy.stats.wasserstein_distance.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks are present; the code does not send data over networks, write to files, or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays (saliency maps) through normalization or clipping functions, then to various metric functions for comparison; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are detected. The code uses standard libraries for image comparison metrics. Variable naming is clear; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple normalization functions to prepare saliency maps for comparison, such as normalization to [-1,1] or [0,1], and clipping. It implements various distance and similarity metrics, including Euclidean, Cosine, Earth Mover's Distance, MAE, Sign Ratio, Sign Distance, IoU, Correlation, MSE, SSIM, PSNR, Czekanowski, Jaccard, and their variations. All functions perform standard mathematical operations with no external system calls or hidden code. Names for metrics are assigned for clarity. The code appears purely analytical and statistical, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard image similarity and distance functions intended for saliency map evaluation. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. All operations are straightforward mathematical computations. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
