{
  "purpose": "Provide a set of functions to compare saliency maps using various similarity and distance metrics for image analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input saliency maps through function parameters; no external data sources or untrusted input is directly read or processed.",
  "sinks": "The functions perform calculations on input arrays; no sinks (e.g., network, file writing, or sensitive data leakage) are present that could be exploited for malicious data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input saliency maps are normalized or clipped; then various distance/similarity computations are performed. There are no evident source-to-sink data flows that lead to external systems or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures are present. The code is straightforward, primarily utility functions for mathematical computations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines normalization, clipping, and multiple distance/similarity metrics for images, all using standard libraries like NumPy, SciPy, scikit-image, and torch. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hidden network activity, or data exfiltration. Functions operate solely on input arrays and produce scalar metric outputs. No external I/O, network communication, or environment variable manipulation occurs. The code appears to be a benign utility module for saliency map comparison.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard collection of image similarity and distance functions without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain backdoors, data theft mechanisms, or obfuscated malware components. Its purpose is clearly for saliency map analysis, and it does so using transparent and well-understood computations.",
