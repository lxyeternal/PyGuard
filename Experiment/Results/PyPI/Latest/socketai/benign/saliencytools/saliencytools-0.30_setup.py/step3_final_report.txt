{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long_description; listing dependencies in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network calls or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A; static setup script with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with explicit dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports setuptools, reads a README file for long description, and specifies dependencies with fixed versions. It does not contain any dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The dependencies are standard scientific packages, pinned to specific versions, reducing supply chain risk. The code adheres to best practices for packaging and is free from malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-formed, and poses no security risks. All reports correctly identify it as a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting the code's safety and simplicity.",
