{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the installation of the 'saliencytools' Python package, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Input from user via package metadata, dependencies list, and package discovery functions.",
  "targets": "None explicitly; standard setup process does not contain data leaks or malicious sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; setup script primarily manages package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging Python code. It imports 'setuptools', specifies package metadata, reads a README file, lists dependencies, and configures package discovery. No untrusted input processing, network communication, or suspicious code structures are present. Dependencies are explicitly listed without suspicious versioning or sources. The code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal setup configuration script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages package installation metadata and dependencies, following standard practices.",
