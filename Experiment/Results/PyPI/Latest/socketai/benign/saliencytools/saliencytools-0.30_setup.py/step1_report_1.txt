{
  "purpose": "To configure the packaging and distribution of the 'saliencytools' Python library, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, description files, and dependency specifications.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily defines package setup parameters without untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content flows into the long_description parameter; dependencies are specified statically; no external data flows at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies in a standard manner. It reads the long_description from an external file, which is typical. The dependencies are explicitly listed and pinned to specific versions. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or untrusted input handling is present. The code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no suspicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated elements. Overall, it appears safe.",
