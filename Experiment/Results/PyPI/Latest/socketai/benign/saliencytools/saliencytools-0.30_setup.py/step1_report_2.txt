{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package called 'saliencytools', including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "The setup script reads the README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present in this script; no untrusted data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the README.md file into the long_description parameter during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code follows standard setup.py conventions with no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion. The long_description is loaded from a local file, which is standard. All dependencies are explicitly listed with version constraints, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic is present. The script does not include any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are processed beyond reading a markdown file, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely defines package metadata and dependencies, with no unusual behavior.",
