  "purpose": "To set up and configure the Python package 'saliencytools' for distribution, specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The setup script reads the README.md file for the long description; it specifies dependencies in the install_requires list.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling are present; no data is processed or transmitted by this script.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows or untrusted input processing in the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors detected. The dependencies appear standard for a scientific package.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads a markdown file for long description, which is common practice. No suspicious code, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution is present. All dependencies are typical for scientific computing and machine learning workflows. The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious instructions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only defines package metadata and dependencies in a standard manner.",
