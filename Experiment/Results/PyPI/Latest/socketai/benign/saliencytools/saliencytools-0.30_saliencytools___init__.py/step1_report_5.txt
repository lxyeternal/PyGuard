  "purpose": "This code appears to be a standard Python module intended for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, environment variables, or external files (if any). No explicit input sources are evident from the snippet provided.",
  "sinks": "Data is possibly written to files, printed to console, or sent over network connections; however, no explicit sinks are identified within the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions; without specific code, no suspicious source-to-sink flow can be confirmed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are observed. The code uses standard Python features; no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, employing standard functions and libraries. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. It neither manipulates sensitive data nor accesses system resources in an unusual manner. Given the limited context, it appears benign and consistent with typical utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code seems to serve legitimate purposes without malicious patterns or vulnerabilities.",
