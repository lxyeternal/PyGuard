  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, files, stdin; no specific sources indicated in provided code.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or security effects through network connections, file operations, or environment variables, but none observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks without suspicious patterns; no malicious flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is either absent or benign, with standard data handling practices. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The scoring aligns with the benign assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and low security risk scores (around 0.1 to 0.2). The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code or its absence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
