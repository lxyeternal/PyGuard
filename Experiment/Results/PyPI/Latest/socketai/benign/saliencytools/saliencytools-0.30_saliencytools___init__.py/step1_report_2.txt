{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module intended for data processing or utility functions, with no clear indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reading input from environment variables, standard input, or external files.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable to unsafe data handling in file writes or network communication if present, but none evident in the code provided.",
  "flows": "Input sources feed into processing functions; no untrusted data flows directly into security-sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures observed. No use of obfuscated code, uncommon language features, or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard functions with proper data handling. No signs of malicious payloads such as network communication to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or system modification routines. The code structure is straightforward and lacks complex or obfuscated constructs. Since only the code snippet is reviewed, the likelihood of hidden malicious behavior is low. No insecure practices or malware patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign component with standard operations. Confidence in this assessment is high, and there is no evidence of obfuscation or malware.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
