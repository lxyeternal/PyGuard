  "conclusion": "The code is predominantly benign across all reports, with some patterns such as obfuscation and dynamic code execution warranting cautious monitoring. The scoring aligns with the described behaviors, and no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. Slight adjustments to malware scoring in Report 4 improve alignment with observed anomalies."
