  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, hardcoded strings, external modules, user input, file inputs, network connections, subprocess calls, dynamic code execution patterns.",
  "sinks": "Network communications, file operations, subprocess executions, environment variable access, eval/exec calls.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables, user inputs, or files to sinks like network, file system, subprocesses, or dynamic code execution points.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), incomplete code sections, suspicious placeholders, dynamic handling of data, unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The reports generally indicate benign code with no confirmed malicious activity. Report 4 stands out with obfuscation and dynamic code patterns, which are suspicious but not definitive. The malware scores are mostly zero, aligning with the lack of confirmed malicious behavior. Obfuscation scores are low except in Report 4. Security risk scores reflect cautiousness, higher in reports mentioning dynamic features. Adjustments are suggested for Report 4, increasing malware score from 0.2 to 0.4 due to obfuscation and dynamic patterns. Overall, the scores are consistent with the evidence, with a conservative stance maintained.",
  "conclusion": "The code is predominantly benign across all reports, with some patterns such as obfuscation and dynamic code execution warranting cautious monitoring. The scoring aligns with the described behaviors, and no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. Slight adjustments to malware scoring in Report 4 improve alignment with observed anomalies.",
