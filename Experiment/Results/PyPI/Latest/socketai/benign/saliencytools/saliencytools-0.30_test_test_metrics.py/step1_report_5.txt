{
  "purpose": "The code tests various metrics functions from the saliencytools library for correctness and symmetry.",
  "sources": "Reads randomly generated numpy arrays (test_map_1, test_map_2).",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data output, network communication, or file writing.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from numpy random arrays into metric functions to evaluate their behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code constructs, no obfuscated code. The code only uses standard numpy functions and metric computations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports multiple metric functions and applies them to randomly generated test data. It performs normalization and clipping, then runs assertions to verify properties such as symmetry, non-negativity, and zero value for identical inputs. The code is straightforward, with no data leakage, external communication, or malicious logic. The use of random data for testing metrics poses no security risk. All operations are purely computational and in-memory. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing routine for metric functions with no malicious behavior detected. It solely performs internal validation without any malicious side effects or malicious data handling.",
