{
  "purpose": "The code defines a test function for various image similarity and distance metrics used in saliency map analysis, primarily for validation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads randomly generated numpy arrays (`test_map_1`, `test_map_2`) as input data, and imports functions from the 'saliencytools' library.",
  "sinks": "The code calls various functions from 'saliencytools' with the test data; these functions compute metrics and do not have direct sinks that could leak data or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "Input data (random maps) flow through clip_mask and normalize_mask_0_1, then into metric functions; the outputs are used only for assertions to validate behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network calls, no file operations, no obfuscated code. The test maps are randomly generated, which is normal for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a straightforward validation of metric functions: generating test data, processing with library functions, and asserting expected properties such as symmetry, non-negativity, and zero value for identical inputs. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It uses standard numpy operations and imported library functions. The overall code is safe, with no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for metric functions, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It purely validates mathematical properties of imported functions without any suspicious activities.",
