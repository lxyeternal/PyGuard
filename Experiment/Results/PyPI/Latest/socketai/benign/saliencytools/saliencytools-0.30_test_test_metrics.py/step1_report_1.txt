{
  "purpose": "The code is used to test various metrics for analyzing the coherency of saliency maps in a project, including normalization, clipping, and metric validation.",
  "sources": "Input data is generated internally via np.random.rand() for test maps; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network connections, file I/O, or system commands are present; the code solely performs calculations and assertions.",
  "flows": "Generated test maps are processed through normalization and clipping functions, then metrics are computed and validated with assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code performs straightforward data generation and testing.",
  "analysis": "The script imports functions from a library called saliencytools to process and compare saliency maps. It generates random test maps, normalizes and clips them, then performs multiple assertions to verify properties like symmetry, non-negativity, and zero difference for identical maps. All operations are standard numerical computations and assertions, with no evidence of malicious behavior, external data leaks, or suspicious activity. The code appears to be a benign test suite for metric validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test script that verifies the correctness of various metrics on randomly generated data. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
