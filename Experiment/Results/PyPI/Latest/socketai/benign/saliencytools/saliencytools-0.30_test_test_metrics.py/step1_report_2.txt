{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test various image similarity metrics for consistency, symmetry, and correctness on randomly generated data.",
  "sources": "Reads random numpy arrays generated within the test_metrics() function as test_map_1 and test_map_2.",
  "sinks": "None observed; the code does not output or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Generates data -> processes data through metric functions -> performs assertions for validation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors observed. Uses standard numpy and imported functions without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple functions from a module named 'saliencytools' and applies them to randomly generated matrices. It performs data normalization, clipping, and several validation assertions such as symmetry, non-negativity, and identicality checks. No external network access, system modification, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code structure appears straightforward, focused on functional testing, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for image similarity metrics with no malicious behavior detected. It solely operates on local generated data and performs assertions to verify function correctness. No security risks or malware indications are evident.",
