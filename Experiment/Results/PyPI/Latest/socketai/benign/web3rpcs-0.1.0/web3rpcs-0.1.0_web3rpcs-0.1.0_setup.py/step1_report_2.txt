  "flows": "Reads static file content into long_description; no data flow to external systems",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup configuration, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata and find packages for distribution. It reads a README file for the long description but does not include any dynamic or untrusted input. No code injection, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The code follows typical packaging conventions with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply configures package metadata and content for distribution.",
