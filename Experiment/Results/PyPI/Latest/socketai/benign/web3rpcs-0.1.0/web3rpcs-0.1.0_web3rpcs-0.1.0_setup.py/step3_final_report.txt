  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a project, defining metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description, uses find_packages() for package discovery.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' to populate long_description; package discovery via find_packages().",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without error handling, but common in setup scripts; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools. It reads a local file 'README.md' without validation, which is standard. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or hardcoded secrets are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed. The code's simplicity and adherence to common packaging practices indicate no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
