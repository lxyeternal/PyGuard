{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'web3rpcs', including metadata and package discovery settings.",
  "sources": "The code reads the long description from the 'README.md' file using open('README.md').read().",
  "sinks": "No data is sent to external sources or untrusted locations; the code does not write or transmit data.",
  "flows": "The source reads from the local 'README.md' file; the data is used in the long_description parameter during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools. It reads a local README file for long description, which is common in Python packaging. There are no code injection points, network connections, or dynamic execution. All components appear typical for package configuration. The script does not perform any data processing or external communication beyond reading a file.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a straightforward package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is a typical, safe use of setuptools for Python packaging.",
