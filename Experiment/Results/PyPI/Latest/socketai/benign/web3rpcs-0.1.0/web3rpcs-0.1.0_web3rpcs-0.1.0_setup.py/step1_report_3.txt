  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'web3rpcs' Python library, defining metadata and package information.",
  "sources": "open('README.md').read() to read long description, find_packages() to discover packages",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content during setup; no flow of untrusted data to sensitive operations",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without validation or sanitization; no suspicious code or hidden behaviors; no dynamic execution or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py file for packaging a Python project. It reads the long description from README.md and uses find_packages() to include all packages. No input validation or data manipulation is present. No external or untrusted data sources are used at runtime, and there are no suspicious operations, code injections, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a typical package configuration file with no malicious intent or security concerns identified. It solely prepares the package for distribution.",
