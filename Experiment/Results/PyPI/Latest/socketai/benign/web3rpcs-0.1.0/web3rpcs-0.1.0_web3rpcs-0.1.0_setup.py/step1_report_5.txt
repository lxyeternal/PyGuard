{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'web3rpcs' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file to obtain the long description.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data output or external data usage beyond reading a file.",
  "flows": "Reads static file 'README.md' to set 'long_description'. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable aspect is reading from 'README.md' without validation, but this is standard practice for package setup. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads package metadata, including the long description from an external markdown file. No code injection, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. It does not contain obfuscated code or suspicious operations. No external network calls, environment variable usage, or data leaks are present. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package without malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares package metadata for distribution.",
