  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'web3rpcs' Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads the long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content during package setup; no data flows to insecure functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata. It reads a file ('README.md') for long description, which is typical in setup scripts. There are no inputs from external or untrusted sources beyond file reading, and no data is sent externally. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present in the code. Usage of 'find_packages()' is standard and does not introduce security concerns. No indication of code injection, backdoors, or malicious logic is found.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is a straightforward package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows standard practices for Python package setup.",
