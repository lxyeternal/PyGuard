{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to validate blockchain endpoints by sending minimal transactions on Ethereum, BSC, and Solana networks, primarily for connectivity or health checks.",
  "sources": "Private keys (`from_private_key`), RPC URLs (`rpc_url`), and predefined contract addresses.",
  "sinks": "Sending raw transactions to blockchain networks; potential exposure of private keys during transaction signing.",
  "flows": "Inputs (private keys, RPC URLs) are used to create and sign transactions; signed transactions are then broadcast to respective networks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; code appears standard for blockchain transaction creation. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs observed. Use of private keys passed directly as parameters could pose risk if misused outside a secure environment, but not malicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code securely connects to blockchain nodes and creates minimal transfer transactions to specific validation contract addresses. It uses standard Web3 and Solana client libraries, with proper balance checks and transaction signing. No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The functions perform legitimate network health checks, with no hidden or malicious behaviors. Private keys are handled explicitly, which could be risky if misused, but no hardcoded secrets or malicious data are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for endpoint validation through blockchain transactions. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. It performs straightforward network interactions with proper checks. However, passing private keys directly warrants careful handling outside this code to prevent exposure.",
