  "purpose": "To set up and configure a Python package named 'web3_validator' for distribution, including reading the README.md for long description.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data is being used to execute commands or write files; no network or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Read the README.md content (source) used in the setup function (sink); no data flows that lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard setup script with no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a markdown file for long description and invokes setup with package metadata and dependencies. No user input, network activity, or executable code is present. No suspicious patterns or code obfuscation are detected. The dependencies are standard libraries for blockchain interactions. The code is straightforward and typical for package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "This is a normal setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It reads a file and calls setup() with standard parameters. No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
