  "purpose": "A setup script for packaging a Python project related to blockchain asset transfer utilities.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata and dependencies specified in setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or dynamic code execution; dependencies are standard blockchain libraries",
  "flows": "Reads static file -> calls setup() with static data; no data flows from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static configuration; no obfuscated or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard 'setup.py' script that reads a README file and calls setuptools.setup() with package info and dependencies. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscated elements. All dependencies are common blockchain libraries. The code's structure and content are typical for package distribution, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free from malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its nature and assign appropriate low scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
