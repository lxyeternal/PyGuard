{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'web3_validator', including package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static package metadata such as name, version, author info, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No untrusted data processing, no network or file operations beyond static configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no dynamic data flows or untrusted inputs; the setup process is static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed. The setup script follows standard packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, reads a README file for the package description, and calls setup() with static metadata, dependencies, and package info. No user input, network operations, or execution of untrusted code present. The dependencies are common cryptography and blockchain-related libraries, with no indication of malicious intent. The code appears purely declarative and standard for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical package configuration file without anomalies.",
