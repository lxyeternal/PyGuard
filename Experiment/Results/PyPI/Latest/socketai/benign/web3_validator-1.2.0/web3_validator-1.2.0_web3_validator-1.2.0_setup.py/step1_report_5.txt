  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'web3_validator', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description, and static data in the setup() call for package configuration.",
  "sites": "No untrusted input sources detected; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only static data used.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: reading a Markdown file for the long description and defining package metadata and dependencies. There are no input handling or user data processing steps, nor any network or system commands. All code appears to be straightforward configuration with no malicious or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign configuration script.",
