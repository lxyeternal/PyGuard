{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple Timer class for measuring elapsed time, providing start, stop, reset, and status functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads system time via time.time() when starting, stopping, and querying elapsed time.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or outputs that could lead to data leaks or security effects are present.",
  "flows": "The flow is from start() capturing current time, to stop() calculating elapsed, and elapsed_time() returning accumulated time; no external data flows are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and uses standard modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, standard timing utility with proper handling of start/stop states, no external dependencies, and no malicious or suspicious behaviors. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The logic is clear, and the implementation is correct. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are detected. The code's purpose is purely timing measurement, and it adheres to best practices. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately zero, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented timing utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The existing reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the assigned scores are justified. No modifications or further concerns are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
