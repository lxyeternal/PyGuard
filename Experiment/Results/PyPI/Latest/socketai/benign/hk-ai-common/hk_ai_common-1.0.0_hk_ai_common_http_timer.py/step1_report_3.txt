{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple timer class to measure elapsed time intervals, with methods to start, stop, reset, and query the elapsed time.",
  "sources": "Code reads current system time using time.time() for measuring elapsed durations.",
  "sinks": "No data is sent to external systems, networks, or stored insecurely; no untrusted input is processed that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The flow involves capturing system time at start and stop methods, calculating differences to determine elapsed time, and updating internal state accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors detected. Logging is used for warnings but not for malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a straightforward timer utility, relying on standard library functions without any obfuscated code or malicious logic. It uses logging for warnings about improper usage but does not perform any harmful actions. No external data sources or sinks are involved, and there are no hidden or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a timer class intended for measuring elapsed time. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks present in this code fragment.",
