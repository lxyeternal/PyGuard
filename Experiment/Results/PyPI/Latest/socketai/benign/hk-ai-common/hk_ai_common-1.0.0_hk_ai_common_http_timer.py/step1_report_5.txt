{
  "purpose": "Implement a simple timer class for measuring elapsed time, with start, stop, reset, and status functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reading the current time via time.time() during start, stop, and elapsed_time methods; reading logger warnings.",
  "sinks": "None identified that would cause data leaks or insecure actions; no external data input or output handling that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "start() reads time.time() and sets start_time; stop() reads time.time() and updates elapsed; elapsed_time() reads time.time() if running; main script calls start, sleep, stop, and print functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; code performs straightforward timing functions with appropriate checks.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard timing utility with safeguards against starting an already running timer or stopping an already stopped timer, with no apparent malicious intent. Usage of logger warnings is benign and intended for debugging or informational purposes. The code does not handle untrusted inputs, perform network operations, or access sensitive data. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard timer implementation for measuring elapsed time; it does not contain malware or security risks. It appears to be benign, with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities identified.",
