{
  "purpose": "Implement a simple timer class for measuring elapsed time, with start, stop, reset, and status functions.",
  "sources": "Input data from time.time() calls, method invocations (start, stop, reset, elapsed_time, is_running).",
  "sinks": "None identified that lead to data leaks, system harm, or security effects.",
  "flows": "User calls start() -> records start_time; stop() -> computes elapsed time from start_time to current time; reset() -> clears timing data; elapsed_time() -> returns accumulated or current elapsed time.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. Uses standard library functions appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Timer class with methods to measure elapsed time. It relies solely on standard logging and time modules. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The logic is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs. Usage examples demonstrate normal timing operations. No malicious or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a timing utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected operations securely without any anomalies or malicious behavior.",
