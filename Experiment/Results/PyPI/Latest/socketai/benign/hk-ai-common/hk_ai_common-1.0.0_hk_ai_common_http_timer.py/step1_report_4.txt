{
  "purpose": "A simple Python timer utility class designed to measure elapsed time with start, stop, reset, and status check functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system time via time.time() when starting, stopping, and querying elapsed time.",
  "sinks": "The system time retrieved by time.time() is used internally; no untrusted input or data flows from external sources or user input.",
  "flows": "No external data flows into or out of the code; the timing functions operate solely on system time and internal state.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code performs straightforward timing operations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic Timer class with methods to start, stop, reset, check elapsed time, and determine if the timer is running. Usage involves standard library calls to time.time() and logging warnings when start/stop operations are called in invalid states. No external inputs are processed, and there are no data leaks, code injections, or suspicious behaviors. The code is standard and safe, intended for measuring code execution durations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign timing utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard Python features and does not process external untrusted data. No security vulnerabilities or malware patterns are detected.",
