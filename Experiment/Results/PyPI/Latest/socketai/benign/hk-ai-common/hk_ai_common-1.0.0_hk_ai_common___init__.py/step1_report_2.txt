{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a standard Python script that performs a specific task, likely related to data processing or utility functions, without any clear malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments, configuration variables, or external files. Specific input sources are not explicitly shown in the provided fragment.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to variables, files, or network sockets, or output is printed. No untrusted sink is explicitly evident in the fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., function parameters or file reads) through processing functions to output sinks (e.g., print statements, file writes). Exact paths are not detailed in the fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code structure appears straightforward with no signs of obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical Python script, analyzing input data and producing output. There are no indicators of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or code injection. The use of third-party libraries, if any, is not suspicious by itself. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present in the visible code. The overall structure suggests standard data processing with no anomalies or signs of sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code seems benign, with no evidence of malware or suspicious behavior. The overall security risk is low.",
