  "purpose": "Define a context variable for tracing identifiers in an application.",
  "sources": "The code reads the default value of the context variable, which is set to '-' and uses an enum to define the key name.",
  "sinks": "The context variable 'trace_id_context' stores the trace ID, which could be accessed elsewhere for logging or tracing purposes.",
  "flows": "The code sets the default value of the context variable and initializes it, but there are no untrusted data flows or external inputs processed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enumeration for context variable keys, specifically for trace IDs. It initializes a context variable with a default value of '-' and explicitly sets it. No input/output, external data processing, or sensitive information handling is present. The structure and usage are standard for context management in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a safe, standard implementation for managing trace IDs within application context. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
