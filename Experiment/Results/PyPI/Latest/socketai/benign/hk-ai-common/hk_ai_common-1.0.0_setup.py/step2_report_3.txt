  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python library.\n- No untrusted input handling, code execution, or network activity is present.\n- The code reads a README file for description, defines dependencies, and calls `setup()` with static metadata.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, and the analysis confirms no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Observations:\n- The code is a typical setup script.\n- No dynamic code execution or untrusted data processing.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- The dependencies are common packages.\n- The code does not perform any network operations or data exfiltration.\n\n### Potential Issues or Flaws:\n- None identified. The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n### Scoring and Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as there are no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are accurate; no suspicious activity is present.\n- The reasoning is sound; the code is standard and safe.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final System Assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis setup script is a benign, standard package configuration with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify this as a normal, non-malicious setup script. No changes to scores or assessments are necessary.",
