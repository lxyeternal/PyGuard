{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python package setup configuration for distributing the 'hk_ai_common' library, including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.rst file for long description; reads package dependencies via install_requires; sources are mainly static strings and file read operation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no untrusted data is being executed, written, or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the README file into the long_description variable; dependencies are specified statically; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected; use of standard setup tools without suspicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration for packaging Python modules. It imports standard packaging tools, reads a README file for description, and specifies package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, no untrusted input handling, and no suspicious code patterns are present. All code segments are standard and well-structured for typical package distribution tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup configuration script with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious activity.",
