  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'hk_ai_common'.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file for long_description and the setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data output to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Read from README.rst → assign to long_description; setup parameters configured for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic detected. No obfuscation or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a README file for long description and calls setup() with typical package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No inputs from untrusted sources beyond reading a local file, and no outputs or network activities are present. No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
