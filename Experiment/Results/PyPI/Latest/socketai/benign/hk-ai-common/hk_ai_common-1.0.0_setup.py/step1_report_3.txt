  "purpose": "This code defines a Python package setup configuration for publishing or installing a package named 'hk_ai_common'.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file for long description; static setup parameters like package name, version, author info, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no execution of external commands or handling of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; configuration parameters are static or read from a local file.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets (other than non-sensitive author info), or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setup tools for Python packaging, reading a README file for description. Dependencies are specified explicitly. No code injection, obfuscation, or malicious code appears present. No network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The code structure and content align with common packaging practices, with no anomalies or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate configuration for publishing a Python package.",
