{
  "purpose": "This script defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'hk_ai_common'.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file for long description, importing setup tools, defining dependencies, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is processed or executed in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.rst' flows into the 'long_description' variable; package metadata and dependencies are statically defined without external untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. The code strictly follows standard package setup conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary setup tools, reads a documentation file for description, and calls the setup() function with static package metadata and dependencies. There are no dynamic code executions, no network operations, and no handling of untrusted input. The dependencies are common packages, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate and standard for Python package distribution. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
