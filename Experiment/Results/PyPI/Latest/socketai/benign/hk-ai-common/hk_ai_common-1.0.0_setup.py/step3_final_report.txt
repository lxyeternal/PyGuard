  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python library, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst file; static strings for package info; no untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "File content into variable; static data used in setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, conventional code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports standard modules, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns. All signals point to benign, standard packaging code. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify this, and their scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
