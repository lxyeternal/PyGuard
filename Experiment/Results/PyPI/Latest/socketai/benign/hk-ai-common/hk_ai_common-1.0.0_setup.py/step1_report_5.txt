  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. Use of standard setup script conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities, reads a README file for long_description, and configures package metadata and dependencies. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. No code injection, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The dependencies listed are common and benign. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues.",
