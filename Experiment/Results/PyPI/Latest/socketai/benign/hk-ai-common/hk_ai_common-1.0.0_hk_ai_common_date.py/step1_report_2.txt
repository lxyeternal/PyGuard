{
  "purpose": "The code formats datetime objects into a specified timezone and output format, primarily for displaying or logging date and time information.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'timezone_str' for timezone selection, 'dt' for datetime object (can be user-supplied or default to current time).",
  "sinks": "The formatted datetime string returned by the function; no untrusted data is used in a vulnerable way, and no external outputs are specified besides printing.",
  "flows": "Input 'timezone_str' and 'dt' flow through 'pytz.timezone()' and 'astimezone()' to produce a localized and formatted string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Exception handling captures errors but does not reveal sensitive info. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function to format datetime objects with timezone support, using standard libraries 'datetime' and 'pytz'. It safely handles the default current time and user-specified timezones. Exception handling is in place for invalid timezone inputs. The code simply returns formatted strings or error messages; it does not process or store sensitive data beyond input parameters. No external network calls, file operations, or code injections are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices without suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard datetime formatting utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs safe operations and includes proper error handling. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks.",
