{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a FastAPI application with custom exception handling, logging, and response formatting, primarily for handling errors and providing standardized JSON responses.",
  "sources": "Request data via FastAPI's Request object, including request method, URL, and request validation errors.",
  "sinks": "Logging functions, creating JSON responses, and setting headers in responses. Trace ID is retrieved from a context variable for traceability.",
  "flows": "Input from HTTP requests is processed, errors are caught and logged, and responses are generated with status, message, and trace ID. Errors propagate through exception handlers, which log details and return structured responses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. Use of context variables and structured error handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides exception handling and response formatting for a FastAPI app. It includes logging of request details, error information, and response times, with custom exception classes for business logic errors. No external or untrusted data manipulation, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The use of context variables for trace IDs is standard for distributed tracing, not malicious. The exception handlers properly catch and log errors without executing untrusted code or external commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of error handling and response management in a FastAPI application. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. It focuses on proper error logging, structured responses, and exception management, with no suspicious or malicious signals.",
