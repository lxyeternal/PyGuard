{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and manages exception handling, logging, and response creation for a FastAPI application, including custom error classes and standardized JSON responses.",
  "sources": "Request data from FastAPI's Request object, error details from exception handlers, trace ID from context variables.",
  "sinks": "Response objects returned to clients, log outputs, headers modification.",
  "flows": "Request is received -> logs start -> request is processed -> exceptions caught and logged -> JSON responses created and returned, with trace IDs included.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behavior detected. Use of standard FastAPI exception handling and logging practices. Trace ID inclusion appears legitimate; no suspicious data leaks or backdoors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides middleware and exception handlers to manage errors, log requests, and return consistent JSON responses. It uses context variables for trace IDs, and logs errors with traceback info, which is standard for debugging. No external data is fetched or sent without validation. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns observed. The use of custom error classes and response creation aligns with common best practices. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, structured for robust error handling and logging in a FastAPI application. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It follows standard patterns and does not exhibit suspicious anomalies. Overall security risk is minimal.",
