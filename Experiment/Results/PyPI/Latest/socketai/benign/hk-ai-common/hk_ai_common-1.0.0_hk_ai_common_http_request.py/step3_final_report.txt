  "purpose": "Define data models for API request and response handling using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "Input data for 'taskId', 'param', 'code', 'message', 'data' fields.",
  "sinks": "None; data models only, no processing or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows into model fields; no further processing or transmission within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward schema definitions with no embedded logic or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Pydantic models, AlgRequest and AlgResponse, with simple fields. No functions, external calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The models are standard for API data validation. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are observed. The code is benign and purely declarative. The untyped Dict fields ('param' and 'data') are common in flexible schemas but do not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The confidence scores of 1 are justified. Overall, the code poses no security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of data schemas with no malicious or security issues. The current scores are accurate and require no modification.",
