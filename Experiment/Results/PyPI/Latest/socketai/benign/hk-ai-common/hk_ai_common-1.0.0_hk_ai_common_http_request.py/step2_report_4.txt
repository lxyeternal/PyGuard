  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is solely defining Pydantic models for request and response data.\n- No dynamic code, external calls, or processing logic are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or obfuscation.\n- The models are straightforward, with no embedded malicious patterns.\n\n**Confirmation of issues:**\n- The code does not contain any issues such as code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- The data models are standard and safe.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign.\n- No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign `malware` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `securityRisk` = 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty.\n- The overall assessment that this code is safe and free of malicious behavior is justified.\n\n**Justification for risk scores:**\n- Since the code only defines data schemas with no processing, no risk exists.\n- The scores align well with the analysis.\n\n**Potential points of challenge:**\n- If the 'param' and 'data' dictionaries are used elsewhere for processing untrusted data, there could be risks, but within this snippet, no such processing occurs.\n- No assumptions about the use of these models are necessary here; the code itself is safe.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0, given the evidence.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, standard implementation of data models using Pydantic, with no malicious or risky elements. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
