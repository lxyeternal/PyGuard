{
  "purpose": "Define data models for algorithm request and response handling using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for AlgRequest and AlgResponse, which read data from external inputs (e.g., JSON payloads).",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the 'param' and 'data' dictionaries could be used to process untrusted input if used improperly elsewhere; however, within this code snippet, no data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "External data inputs are mapped into the data models; no further data flow or processing is shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines Pydantic models with straightforward fields for 'taskId', 'param', 'code', 'message', and 'data'. There are no operations, logic, or data processing that could introduce malicious behavior. The models are typical for data validation and serialization/deserialization in an API context. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard data model definitions for API request and response objects with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It is safe and appears purely for data validation purposes.",
