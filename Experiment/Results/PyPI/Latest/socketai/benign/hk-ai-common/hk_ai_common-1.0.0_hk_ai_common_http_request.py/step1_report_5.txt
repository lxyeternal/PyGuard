{
  "purpose": "Define data models for algorithm request and response handling using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; the code does not read external input directly.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external output handling shown.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only declares data models without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. Usage of Pydantic for data validation is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Pydantic models for structured data input and output. No external data sources, no data flows, and no suspicious constructs are present. The models include straightforward fields with no embedded logic or code execution. The code serves purely as data schema definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard use of Pydantic for data modeling without any malicious intent.",
