  "purpose": "Define data models for algorithm request and response payloads using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "Input data through AlgRequest (taskId, param), output data through AlgResponse (taskId, code, message, data).",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data assigned to model fields; however, Pydantic validates and sanitizes input.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from external sources into AlgRequest; processed and output via AlgResponse.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. Usage of Pydantic is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two data models using Pydantic's BaseModel for structured data validation. No external data sources, network operations, or code execution occurs here. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are present. The models simply serve as schemas for request and response data. There are no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code flows.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of data schemas for API communication, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
