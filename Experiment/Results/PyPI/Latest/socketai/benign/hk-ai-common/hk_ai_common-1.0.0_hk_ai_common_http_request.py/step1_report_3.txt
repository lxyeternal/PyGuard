  "purpose": "Defines data models for algorithm request and response handling using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class definitions for data validation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or untrusted data handling beyond data models.",
  "flows": "Data flows are not present; this is solely schema definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type annotations and Pydantic for data validation, defining two simple models: AlgRequest and AlgResponse. No input/output operations, external data fetching, or dynamic code execution observed. The data models are generic, with no suspicious patterns or embedded malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and only contains data model definitions with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
