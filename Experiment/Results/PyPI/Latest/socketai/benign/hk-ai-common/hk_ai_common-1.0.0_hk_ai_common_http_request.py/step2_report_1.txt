  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely defining data models using Pydantic.\n- No external data processing, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The models are straightforward, with no embedded logic or side effects.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: two classes, `AlgRequest` and `AlgResponse`, with simple fields.\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n- The reasoning in each report appears sound and consistent.\n\n**Potential issues or points to challenge:**\n- The 'param' and 'data' fields are of type `Dict`, which are untyped dictionaries. While this is common, it can be a source of untrusted data passing through without validation of internal structure. However, this is standard practice in flexible schemas and not inherently malicious.\n- Since the code is only schema definitions, the potential for malicious behavior depends on how these models are used elsewhere, which is not shown here.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is appropriate given the code.\n- `obfuscated: 0` is correct; no obfuscation is evident.\n- `securityRisk: 0` is justified; no vulnerabilities are introduced by schema definitions alone.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems reasonable.\n\n**Justification for risk scores:**\n- Since the code is purely declarative and does not execute any logic, the risk is minimal.\n- No evidence of malicious intent or security issues.\n- The only consideration is that if these models are used improperly elsewhere (e.g., accepting unvalidated user input), risks could arise outside this code snippet, but within the scope of the provided code, none are evident.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk score: 0.1 (to reflect minimal potential if misused, but within this context, effectively negligible)\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is a standard schema definition with no malicious or security issues.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, and the current scores accurately reflect its benign nature.",
