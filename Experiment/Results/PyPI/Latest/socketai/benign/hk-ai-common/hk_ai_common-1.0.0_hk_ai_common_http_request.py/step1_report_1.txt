{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for algorithm request and response using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "Input data from external sources, likely via API endpoints that instantiate these models.",
  "sinks": "Data is assigned to model fields; no sinks for untrusted data are explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "External input (e.g., taskId and param) flows into models; no further data flow is visible.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines Pydantic models for request and response structures. It imports standard libraries and the pydantic library, then creates two classes with straightforward fields. There are no functions, external calls, or dynamic code execution present. The models serve as data containers without processing logic or side effects. The code appears to be a typical schema definition, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data schema definition for handling algorithm request and response data. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
