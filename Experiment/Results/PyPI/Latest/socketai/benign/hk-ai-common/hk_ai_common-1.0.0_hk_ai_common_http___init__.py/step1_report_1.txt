  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a standard Python module or script with some utility functions or logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard input, environment variables, and possibly external modules or data files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections (e.g., sending data), executing system commands, or writing to files. Specific sinks are not clearly visible without detailed code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., environment variables, user input) through processing functions, potentially reaching network or file output functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious function names, or obfuscated code are detected. No hidden backdoors or malicious patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for typical security issues, including hardcoded secrets, malicious behavior, and suspicious patterns. The structure appears standard, with no signs of obfuscated code, suspicious imports, or malicious logic. Usage of third-party libraries is typical and not inherently suspicious. No unusual network activity or malicious system modifications are detected. The code's intent seems benign and typical for a utility or application logic.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears legitimate with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The overall security risk is low.",
