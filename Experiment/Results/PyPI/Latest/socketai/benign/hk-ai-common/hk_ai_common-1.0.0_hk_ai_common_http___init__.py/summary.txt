  "malware_score": 0.65,
  "security_risk": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0.65,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that Report 4 indicates high suspicion of malicious activity justified by suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and dynamic code execution. Reports 1-3 are benign, and Report 5 shows moderate suspicion. The current scores are appropriate; minor adjustments could be made to Report 5's malware score if additional evidence emerges. Overall, the supply chain security assessment suggests a moderate to high risk primarily driven by the patterns in Report 4, with caution advised when deploying or further analyzing this dependency."
