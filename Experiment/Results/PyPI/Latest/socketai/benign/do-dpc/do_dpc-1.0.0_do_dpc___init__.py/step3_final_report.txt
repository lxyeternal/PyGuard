  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on provided code snippets and analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data reading from environment variables, user inputs, network connections, file I/O, and external libraries.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, potential data leaks, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user inputs flow into processing functions, with outputs potentially sent over network or written to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign code with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. Confidence levels vary but are generally high when detailed code is available. Malware scores are consistently zero, matching the absence of malicious indicators. Risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified. The assessments are coherent and justified based on the descriptions provided.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets reviewed are benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analyses. Overall, the dependency appears safe for use.",
