  "purpose": "This code appears to be a standard Python module or script performing typical operations, with no obvious malicious intent or embedded payloads.",
  "sources": "Reads data from standard input, environment variables, or file system; no suspicious or hardcoded external data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Uses standard library functions for data processing and output; no untrusted data sinks such as network connections or system commands that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through internal processing functions to output or stored variables; no indication of malicious source-to-sink flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present; no obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variable names observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of typical Python constructs with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic. It reads inputs and processes data securely using standard libraries. No network connections, credential handling, or malicious behavior evident. The code structure and formatting are clean and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code appears to be benign and safe for use.",
