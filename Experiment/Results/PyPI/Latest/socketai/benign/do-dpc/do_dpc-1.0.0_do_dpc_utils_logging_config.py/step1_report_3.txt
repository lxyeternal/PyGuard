  "purpose": "Configure application-wide logging with colored console output and file logging, including custom formatting.",
  "sources": "path_manager.get_log_file() call to obtain log file path; logging setup functions and configurations.",
  "sinks": "logging.FileHandler and logging.StreamHandler where log messages are written to file and console respectively.",
  "flows": "Log messages are formatted and sent through handlers, written to file and displayed on console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, external network access, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging with color formatting for console and plain formatting for file output. It retrieves log file path via a method from an imported utility module, which is standard. The formatter definitions, handler setup, and configuration are straightforward. No external inputs, no data leaks, no malicious code, and no suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to serve a benign purpose of logging configuration with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging setup with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code, nor does it perform any unintended actions. It is safe and aligns with typical logging practices.",
