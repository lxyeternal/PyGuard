  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious commands, or malicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code. Uses standard logging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging with custom color formatting for console output and a file handler for persistent logs. It dynamically obtains the log file path via get_path_manager(), which appears to be a legitimate utility call. No external data inputs are processed, and no untrusted data flows into system commands or insecure data handling. No suspicious or malicious code segments are present. The use of standard libraries and patterns indicates benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical logging setup module with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. It leverages a legitimate utility to determine log file locations and uses standard Python logging practices.",
