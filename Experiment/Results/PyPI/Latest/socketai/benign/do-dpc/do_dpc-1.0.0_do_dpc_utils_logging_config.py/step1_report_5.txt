  "purpose": "Configure application-wide logging with colored console output and file logging, utilizing paths from a path manager utility.",
  "sources": "PathManager.get_log_file() method for log file path; logging functions for log output.",
  "sinks": "FileHandler writing logs to disk; StreamHandler outputting to console.",
  "flows": "PathManager.get_log_file() -> log file path; logging calls -> file and console handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of ANSI escape codes is for formatting only; no obfuscated code detected. No external data inputs or untrusted data sources identified.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a logging configuration with color-coded console output and file logging, utilizing a singleton PathManager for log file path. It defines a custom formatter for colored output and attaches handlers to the root logger. There are no apparent data leaks, external network activity, or malicious code segments. The code's behavior is standard for logging configuration, with no unusual patterns, no use of dynamic code execution, and no hidden backdoors or credential theft mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward logging setup module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only formats and directs logs to files and console, with no external communication or data exfiltration involved.",
