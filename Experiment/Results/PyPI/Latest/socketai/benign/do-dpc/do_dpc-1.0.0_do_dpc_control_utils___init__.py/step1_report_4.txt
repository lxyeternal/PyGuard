{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be intended for standard functionality, but without explicit context, its purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables and user inputs, such as os.environ and input() functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous sinks include network communication via socket or requests, file writes, or subprocess calls, though these are not explicitly shown in the code snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or user inputs through processing functions to outputs or external systems, but specific paths cannot be fully traced without the actual code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are detected in the visible code segment. However, the code structure is minimal and may lack context.",
  "analysis": "The code is very minimal and primarily involves reading environment variables and user input. No malicious or suspicious patterns like code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. Without more detailed code or behavior, the risk assessment remains limited.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard but limited in scope. Additional context or code sections are needed for a more thorough analysis.",
