{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to convert system outputs of double integrator models and rocket models into error and derivative of error for control purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'output' and 'output_target' in each conversion function; numpy arrays are read to compute errors.",
  "sinks": "Return values 'error' and 'der_error' are outputs; no external sinks or data leaks present. No data is sent over the network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Input 'output' data flows through calculations to produce 'error' and 'der_error' outputs, based on difference from 'output_target'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. No obfuscated or unusual language features. The code performs straightforward mathematical transformations.",
  "analysis": "The code contains functions to convert the outputs of specific dynamical models into errors and their derivatives, using simple numpy array operations. The functions include input validation for array sizes and default to zero targets if none are provided. No external network, file operations, or environment variable usage. No suspicious code structures or behaviors are identified. All computations are deterministic and relevant to control system modeling. No signs of malicious intent or malicious data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for converting model outputs into control errors, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is well-structured, with proper input validation and straightforward calculations.",
