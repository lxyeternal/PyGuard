  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report concludes the code is legitimate, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It notes the functions perform standard control utility operations, with no external communication or data exfiltration.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score seems reasonable given the code's straightforward nature. The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious indicators. The confidence is high (1.0).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the straightforward nature of the functions, with no external data handling or suspicious behaviors. The domain-specific adjustments are typical in control algorithms.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the previous, the scores seem appropriate. No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the benign nature, with no external communication or malicious code. The adjustments in the rocket function are domain-specific, not suspicious.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower security risk, which is justified. The malware score remains zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—functions are standard control utilities with no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reaffirms the benign, straightforward nature of the code, with no malicious behaviors or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.0\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. Given the code's nature—simple numpy operations, no external communication, no code injection, or suspicious behaviors—the malware score should remain at **0**.\n  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or code hiding techniques. The obfuscated score should be **0**.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The security risk is minimal, primarily because the code is utility functions without external dependencies or side effects. The highest reported is 0.1, which seems reasonable. I would agree with a score of **0.0 to 0.1**.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.0 — no external dependencies, no network or file operations, no suspicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| **0**         | **0**             | **0.0**   |\n\nThe overall assessment confirms that the code is benign, safe, and standard for control utility functions.",
