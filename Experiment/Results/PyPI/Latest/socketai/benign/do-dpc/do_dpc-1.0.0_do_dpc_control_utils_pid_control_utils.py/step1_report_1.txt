{
  "purpose": "Provide helper functions to convert outputs of double integrator systems and rocket systems into error signals and derivatives of error for control purposes.",
  "sources": "Input arguments 'output' and 'output_target' in each function; internal array operations and shape checks.",
  "sinks": "Error and derivative arrays returned; no untrusted data written to external systems or files; no network activity or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'output' is processed with optional 'output_target' to produce error and derivative arrays; no external side effects or data leaks detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors identified. The rocket output processing includes adjustments that may seem specific, but are within normal control system design; no obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code contains three functions converting system outputs into error signals for control loops. Each function performs shape validation, uses simple arithmetic operations, and applies optional target references. The 'rocket_output_to_err_der_err' function implements domain-specific adjustments, but these are typical in control algorithms. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration are present. Usage of numpy for array manipulations is standard. No external communications, credential handling, or obfuscated code detected. The code appears legitimate and adheres to typical control system helper functions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of control utility functions with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard operations for converting system outputs into error signals for control applications, with no suspicious behaviors observed.",
