  "purpose": "Convert outputs from double integrator and rocket systems into error signals and their derivatives for control purposes.",
  "sources": "Input arrays 'output' and optional 'output_target' parameters, which are data from system states and targets.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; data flows are internal calculations within the functions, producing error and derivative arrays.",
  "flows": "Input 'output' flows into calculations for error and derivative, with optional 'output_target' influencing the error computations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs standard validation and straightforward arithmetic operations. Domain-specific adjustments in 'rocket_output_to_err_der_err' are typical in control systems.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for transforming system outputs into control error signals. Shape validation ensures correct input dimensions. Default targets are zero if not provided. The 'rocket_output_to_err_der_err' function includes domain-specific adjustments, but these are standard in control applications. No external communication, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The functions are well-structured, with clear logic and no suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard control utility functions with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The domain-specific adjustments are typical and do not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero.",
