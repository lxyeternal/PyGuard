  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its purpose, and the provided assessments.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code performs straightforward numerical transformations.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or file operations are present.\n- The functions include input validation and default behaviors.\n- The domain-specific adjustments in `rocket_output_to_err_der_err` seem typical for control systems.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code snippets match the described functions.\n- Shape checks and default target handling are consistent.\n- The calculations are standard for control error signals.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **No significant errors or flaws** are evident in the code logic.\n- The shape validation checks are correct.\n- The optional `output_target` defaulting to zeros is appropriate.\n- The domain-specific adjustments in `rocket_output_to_err_der_err` seem reasonable.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- All reports assign malware scores of **0**, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1 or 0), aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign high risk; all are around 0.1 or 0.\n- The code is standard utility functions without malicious intent.\n- No suspicious behaviors justify higher scores.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The only domain-specific adjustment is in `rocket_output_to_err_der_err`, which appears legitimate.\n- No signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- The functions do not process untrusted external data sources beyond input arguments.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, due to domain-specific adjustments but no real security concern.\n\n### My reasoned estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to the specific adjustments in `rocket_output_to_err_der_err`, but these are standard in control systems and not suspicious).\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a set of legitimate, domain-appropriate helper functions for control systems. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present. The low risk score is justified, and the overall security posture is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** I recommend maintaining awareness of domain-specific adjustments, but in this case, they do not raise security concerns.",
