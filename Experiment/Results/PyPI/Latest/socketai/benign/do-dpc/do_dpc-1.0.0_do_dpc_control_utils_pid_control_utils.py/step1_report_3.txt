{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions to convert system outputs of double integrator models and a rocket model into error signals and their derivatives for control purposes.",
  "sources": "The functions read system output arrays (`output`) and optional target arrays (`output_target`).",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks such as network communication, file writing, or data exfiltration. The code mainly performs mathematical operations.",
  "flows": "Input arrays (`output`, `output_target`) are processed to compute error and derivative of error, which are returned as numpy arrays.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs straightforward mathematical transformations. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or misleading variables are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions to convert model outputs into error signals suitable for control algorithms. These functions check output array dimensions and handle optional target arrays. The functions perform standard calculations involving differences between system outputs and targets, with some domain-specific adjustments (e.g., y_adj in rocket function). The code imports only standard and control utility modules, with no network, file I/O, or system commands. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign helper functions for control systems, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs mathematical conversions without any hidden or harmful operations.",
