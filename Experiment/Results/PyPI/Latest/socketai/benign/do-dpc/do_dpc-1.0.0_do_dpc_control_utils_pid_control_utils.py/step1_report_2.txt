{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to convert double integrator system outputs into error and derivative of error for control purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via function arguments (output, output_target). No external data sources or untrusted inputs are explicitly read within the functions.",
  "sinks": "Calculations produce error and derivative error arrays. No data is written to external systems, files, or network connections within this code.",
  "flows": "Input 'output' and 'output_target' flow through the functions to generate error and derivative error outputs; no external untrusted data sources or sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward numerical computations; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The 'rocket_output_to_err_der_err' function includes specific adjustments, but these are consistent with control logic and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform standard transformations of system outputs to error signals. They include shape checks and default zero targets, which are typical in control utility code. The 'rocket_output_to_err_der_err' function contains domain-specific calculations, but nothing suspicious or malicious. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious network activity is present. The code is clean, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions for control system error calculation without malicious behavior. It does not perform any suspicious operations, external data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions are domain-specific but safe and standard in control applications.",
