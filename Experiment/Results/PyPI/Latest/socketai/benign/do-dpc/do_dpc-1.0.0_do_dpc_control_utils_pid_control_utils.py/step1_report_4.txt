  "purpose": "Provide helper functions to convert system outputs of double integrator models and rocket models into error signals and their derivatives for control purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'output' and 'output_target' arrays in each function.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network communication, or file writing present. No untrusted data processing beyond input handling.",
  "flows": "Input 'output' arrays are processed to compute error and derivative, with optional use of 'output_target' as a reference. No external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The rocket output function contains domain-specific calculations but nothing inherently malicious. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward data transformations converting system state vectors into error signals for control algorithms. It includes validation checks for input array sizes and optional target references. The functions perform standard mathematical operations and array manipulations without external communication or hidden behaviors. The domain-specific calculations in 'rocket_output_to_err_der_err' relate to physics modeling, not malicious activity. No anomalies or suspicious patterns found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate helper functions for control system error calculation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation is standard and domain-appropriate. Overall, it is safe for use.",
