  "purpose": "Assess the security posture of the provided Python code snippets or descriptions, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, descriptions of code behavior, and documentation provided in the reports.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows from input sources to outputs or external communications, including network connections, data processing, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input variables or data files through processing functions to sinks like network transmissions, file writes, or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "Any hardcoded secrets, suspicious external connections, obfuscation techniques, or unusual code constructs; none identified in the provided descriptions.",
  "analysis": "All reports describe minimal or non-operational code, with no suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the descriptions. Risk scores are mostly low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern but some caution due to limited context. For reports lacking code or documentation, setting risk to 0 would be more precise. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited information. Overall, the assessments are reasonable and aligned with the content.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets and descriptions indicate a benign, non-malicious state with no obfuscation or malicious activity detected. The scores are appropriate, though minor adjustments to risk scores for non-code reports could improve accuracy. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears secure based on current data.",
