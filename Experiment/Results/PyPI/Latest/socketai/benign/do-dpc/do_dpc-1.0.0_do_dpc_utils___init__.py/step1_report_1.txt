  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for general functionality; no explicit purpose is discernible from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'input_data' variable and potentially from environment variables or external files if present (not shown).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to 'output_result' or makes network requests if present; no explicit sinks are shown in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output points; exact paths are unclear due to incomplete code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual language features are evident. The code structure is straightforward with no obfuscation or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is minimal and appears to be a simple data processing script. No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, file modifications, or secret exfiltration mechanisms are present. The absence of complex or obscure code structures suggests low risk. Since only a fragment is provided, full assessment of hidden malicious intent is limited, but nothing suspicious is apparent from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with standard data handling. Due to limited context, confidence remains moderate, but no malicious or obfuscated elements are detected.",
