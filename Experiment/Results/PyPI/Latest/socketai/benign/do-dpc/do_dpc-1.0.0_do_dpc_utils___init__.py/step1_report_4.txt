{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a placeholder or template for code review instructions rather than actual executable code. It defines a detailed process for analyzing code but does not contain any functional logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "No actual data input or external data sources are read; the code does not perform any data input operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present; the code does not write or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths exist as there is no functional code involved.",
  "anomalies": "The entire content is a static JSON object with no operational code, which may suggest it is a template or placeholder. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behaviors present. The code structure is a consistent JSON schema without obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a static JSON structure outlining a code review methodology. It does not execute any logic, process data, or interact with external systems. The structure is clear and well-defined, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Since it lacks actual code implementation beyond the review instructions, there are no security issues, no data leaks, and no suspicious behaviors. It functions solely as documentation or a guide for review, not as operational code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-executable template outlining a security review process. It poses no security risk, malware, or malicious intent, and it is not obfuscated. It serves as a procedural guide rather than active code. Therefore, no security concerns are identified.",
