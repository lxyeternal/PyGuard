{
  "purpose": "The code handles control input generation and trajectory data collection for data-driven control of an LTI system, including data storage and optional PID control.",
  "sources": "Data sources include sys.get_output() to read system outputs, and ctrl_gen.generate() to generate control inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include storing generated control inputs and outputs in arrays, and the use of sys.step(u_next) to advance the system, which could be malicious if sys is malicious.",
  "flows": "System output is read at each iteration; control inputs are generated and possibly modified via PID; data is stored in trajectory arrays; system is stepped forward with control input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data leaks detected. Usage of standard libraries and functions appears benign. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common data manipulation libraries and a logging utility; it defines a TrajectoryCollector class for storing trajectory data with proper shape checks and NaN handling. The main function collects data from an LTI system, optionally applying PID control, with data stored systematically. No suspicious data flows or malicious patterns are evident. The control and data collection procedures appear standard for control systems research or data-driven modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical trajectory data collection for control systems, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. It uses legitimate methods and libraries, and there are no suspicious behaviors or anomalies detected.",
