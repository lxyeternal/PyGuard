{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for control input generation and collecting trajectory data from an LTI system for data-driven control applications.",
  "sources": "Reads from the system via sys.get_output() and sys.step(), generates control inputs using WhiteNoiseGenerator, optionally modifies control inputs with PIDController, and reads internal variables like np.nan and np.zeros.",
  "sinks": "Stores control inputs and outputs in numpy arrays, which are later returned. No direct sink for untrusted input; the data is internally generated or retrieved from the system.",
  "flows": "System output from sys.get_output() -> control input generation -> optional PID modification -> store_measurements() -> system step -> repeat until data collected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are observed. The code performs standard control data collection and logging, with no evident malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data collection routines for control systems, initializing trajectory storage, generating control signals via a noise generator, and optionally applying PID corrections. It collects data over a specified number of samples, storing outputs and inputs into arrays, and cleaning data before returning. No suspicious network activity, file manipulation, or malicious code constructs are present. Logging is used for tracing internal states, but no hidden or obfuscated behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation for collecting control and trajectory data from an LTI system with optional PID control. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code adheres to standard practices for such data collection tasks.",
