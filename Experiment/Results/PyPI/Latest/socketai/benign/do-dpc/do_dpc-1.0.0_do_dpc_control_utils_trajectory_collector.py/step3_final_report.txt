  "purpose": "Collects system output (`y`) and control input (`u`) trajectories for data-driven control applications, optionally applying PID correction.",
  "sources": "Reads system output via `sys.get_output()`, generates control inputs using `WhiteNoiseGenerator`, and optionally computes PID corrections.",
  "sinks": "Stores data in internal numpy arrays (`self.y`, `self.u`), returns `InputOutputTrajectory` object; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Generates control input (`u_next`), applies optional PID correction, stores measurements (`y_next`, `u_next`), advances system (`sys.step(u_next)`), repeats for `n_samples`.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. NaN handling is standard; no external communication or suspicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation for collecting trajectory data from a control system simulation. It uses standard libraries (`numpy`, `tqdm`) and well-known control utilities. Data is stored internally, with NaN values cleaned before returning. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data leaks are present. The external `sys` object is assumed to be benign; if malicious, it could cause harm, but this is outside the code's scope. The scoring aligns with the code's benign and transparent nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign data collection utility for control systems with no malicious or obfuscated elements. Security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is zero. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.",
