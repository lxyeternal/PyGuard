{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for data collection from a linear time-invariant (LTI) system, generating control inputs, and recording trajectory data for control applications.",
  "sources": "Reads system output via sys.get_output(), generates control inputs using WhiteNoiseGenerator, and optionally modifies inputs with PID control.",
  "sinks": "Stores data into internal arrays within TrajectoryCollector, and returns trajectory data. No evident data leaks or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Input control signals are generated, possibly modified by PID, then stored. System outputs are read, stored, and used for further control. Data is retrieved at the end.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or hidden code. Usage of NaN for placeholders is standard. No obfuscated code features or unusual dynamic execution present. No signs of malicious backdoors or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically initializes trajectory storage, generates control signals with optional PID correction, and collects system outputs. It performs data validation, logging, and NaN handling. No external or suspicious code paths are observed. Functions are straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns or embedded malicious logic. It relies on external libraries for noise generation, logging, and system simulation, all of which are common in control systems. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data theft, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data collection utility for control system experiments, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe based on the provided code snippet.",
