{
  "purpose": "This code handles the collection of trajectory data from an LTI system for data-driven control applications, including optional PID control and noise generation for input signals.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from system output (`sys.get_output()`) and control input generator (`WhiteNoiseGenerator.generate()`). External configuration is provided via function arguments (`n_samples`, `exc_dev`, `pid_combo`).",
  "sinks": "Data is stored into numpy arrays (`self.y`, `self.u`) within the `TrajectoryCollector`, and final data is returned as an `InputOutputTrajectory` object.",
  "flows": "The system output `y_next` is generated by `sys.step()`, control inputs `u_next` are generated by `WhiteNoiseGenerator` and possibly modified by PID control, then stored in trajectory arrays. Final trajectory data is cleaned and returned after collection.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data leakage routines are present. The code appears standard for data collection in control systems.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes trajectory storage with NaNs, stores system outputs and control inputs sequentially, and warns when data is incomplete. It utilizes existing libraries for noise generation and logging. The control flow is straightforward: generate control input, optionally modify with PID, step the system, and store results. Final data cleaning replaces NaNs with zeros, which is typical. No obfuscated language features or malicious routines are detected. All data flows are from trusted functions to safe storage, with no external network communications or sensitive data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard data collection for control system experiments, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as expected for its purpose, with proper data handling and logging. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security breaches.",
