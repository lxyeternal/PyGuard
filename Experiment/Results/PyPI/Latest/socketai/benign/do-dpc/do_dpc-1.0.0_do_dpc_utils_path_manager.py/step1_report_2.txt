{
  "purpose": "Manages file paths for logs, data, examples, and videos, ensuring directories exist and providing formatted filenames with optional timestamps.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters, system file paths, current date/time, and static folder names.",
  "sinks": "Provides paths for log and data files; no direct untrusted data input or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Uses internal data (base directory, filenames, current date) to generate full paths for logs and data; no external data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; directory creation is straightforward; no hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles filesystem operations, directory creation, and path formatting. It employs standard libraries and practices for path handling and logging. No external data inputs, network activity, or sensitive information handling are present. The singleton pattern is used for the PathManager instance, which is a common design pattern. All operations are safe and well-contained, with appropriate error handling for directory creation. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical filesystem management module with no malicious intent or security risks. It securely creates and manages paths, with no indications of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is minimal.",
