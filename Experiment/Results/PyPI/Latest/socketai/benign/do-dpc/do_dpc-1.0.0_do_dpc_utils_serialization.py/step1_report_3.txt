  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for serializing and deserializing dataclass objects to and from NumPy `.npz` files, supporting numerical data types.",
  "sources": "Reads dataclass fields using `dataclasses.fields()`, loads `.npz` files via `np.load()`.",
  "sinks": "Writes data to `.npz` files via `np.savez_compressed()`, reconstructs dataclass objects from loaded data.",
  "flows": "Dataclass fields are extracted and stored in a dictionary; saved via `np.savez_compressed()`. On load, data from `.npz` is mapped back to fields for object reconstruction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code only handles numerical data types and standard serialization logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for saving and loading dataclasses in NumPy's compressed format. It strictly supports numerical types (`np.ndarray`, `float`, `int`) and raises errors for unsupported types, reducing risk of malicious data injection. The data flow involves serializing fields from dataclass instances into a NumPy `.npz` file and reconstructing dataclass instances from such files. No network activity, command execution, or system modification is present. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, safe utility for serializing dataclasses with numerical data. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. It is a standard implementation with no signs of malware or security risks.",
