  "purpose": "Utility functions for serializing and deserializing dataclass objects using NumPy's compressed `.npz` format, supporting numerical types.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the `.npz` file in `load_dataclass_npz` and from dataclass attributes in `save_dataclass_npz`.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to a `.npz` file in `save_dataclass_npz` and loaded from a `.npz` file in `load_dataclass_npz`. No external sinks like network or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Dataclass fields are collected and stored in a dictionary during save; during load, data from `.npz` is used to instantiate the dataclass.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code explicitly restricts data types to numeric types, avoiding unsafe data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward serialization/deserialization functions focused on numerical dataclass attributes, avoiding strings, lists, or dicts. There are no network operations, system calls, or dynamic code execution. The functions handle standard file IO and data conversions, with clear type restrictions. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks is found. All operations are typical for serialization tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for numerical dataclass serialization using NumPy, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It strictly manages data types and performs safe file operations.",
