{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for saving and loading dataclass objects to and from NumPy compressed `.npz` files, supporting numerical data types.",
  "sources": "Data is read from dataclass attributes during save_dataclass_npz, and from the `.npz` file during load_dataclass_npz.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to a `.npz` file by save_dataclass_npz, and read back during load_dataclass_npz; no external untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "Data from dataclass attributes flows into a dictionary and is saved into a `.npz` file; upon loading, data from the `.npz` file flows back into the dataclass constructor.",
  "anomalies": "The code strictly handles only numpy.ndarray, float, and int types; there are no suspicious data manipulations or code obfuscation. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for serializing and deserializing dataclasses with NumPy arrays and scalar numerical types. It validates data types before saving, raising errors for unsupported types, which prevents unintended data leaks or malicious data handling. The loading function correctly reconstructs the dataclass, handling 0D numpy arrays and ensuring only supported types are processed. No external inputs are processed insecurely, nor are there any network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration routines. The code is straightforward, purpose-driven, and employs standard libraries without obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears secure, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behaviors. It performs standard serialization tasks with proper data validation and error handling. There are no indications of malware, backdoors, or data leaks within this code snippet.",
