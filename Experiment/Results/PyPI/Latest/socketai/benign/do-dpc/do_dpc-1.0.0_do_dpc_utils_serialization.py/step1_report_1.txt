  "purpose": "Utility functions for saving and loading dataclass objects to and from NumPy compressed `.npz` files.",
  "sources": "Reading dataclass fields with `dataclasses.fields(obj)` and `np.load(filename)` for data retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Data is stored in files specified by `filename`, but no external data is transmitted over the network or written outside local file storage.",
  "flows": "Dataclass attributes are extracted and validated, then stored in a `.npz` file; data is loaded from a `.npz` file and used to instantiate a dataclass object.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data handling are present. The code is straightforward with proper data handling. No hardcoded credentials or unusual behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard serialization/deserialization functions for dataclasses using NumPy. It restricts stored data types to numerical types, preventing potential misuse. The loading function converts 0D NumPy arrays to scalars, ensuring correct data types. No network operations, no data exfiltration, and no backdoors are present. The code appears purely for data storage and retrieval with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for saving and loading numerical dataclasses with NumPy; there are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It adheres to best practices for type validation and data handling. Overall, the code is benign and safe.",
