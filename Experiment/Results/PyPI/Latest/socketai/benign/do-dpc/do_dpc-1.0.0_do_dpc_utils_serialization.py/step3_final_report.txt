{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for saving and loading dataclass objects using NumPy's compressed `.npz` format, supporting only numerical types (np.ndarray, float, int).",
  "sources": "Reads dataclass fields via dataclasses.fields() during save; loads data with np.load() during load.",
  "sinks": "Writes data to a file via np.savez_compressed; reads data from a file via np.load().",
  "flows": "Extracts attribute values from dataclass instances; serializes supported types; during load, reads data and reconstructs dataclass instance, converting 0D numpy arrays to scalars.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no network activity, no suspicious data handling. Strict type enforcement limits support to numerical types only.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward serialization/deserialization of numerical dataclass attributes, with validation to prevent unsupported types. It converts 0D numpy arrays to scalars for ease of use. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. Error handling is appropriate for unsupported types. The design is simple and secure, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for numerical dataclass serialization. It supports only specific data types, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The security risk is minimal, and the implementation aligns with safe coding practices.",
