{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for serializing and deserializing dataclass objects to and from NumPy `.npz` files, supporting numerical data types.",
  "sources": "Reads data from `.npz` files using `np.load` and from dataclass fields using `dataclasses.fields()`",
  "sinks": "Saves data to `.npz` files via `np.savez_compressed`; reconstructs dataclass instances using `cls(**field_data)`",
  "flows": "Reads data from files into memory (`np.load`), processes data, then writes or reconstructs objects based on dataclass definitions",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no hidden data processing, and no suspicious dynamic code execution or code injection detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard serialization/deserialization of numerical dataclass attributes using NumPy's save/load functions. It enforces type constraints (np.ndarray, float, int), raising errors for unsupported types. The load function converts 0D NumPy arrays to scalars and reconstructs dataclasses via their constructors. All data handling appears safe, with no evidence of data leaks, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior. File operations are straightforward and typical for serialization tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe utility for handling numerical dataclass serialization. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. It strictly handles numerical data and standard file I/O, with appropriate error handling. Overall, it appears secure and benign.",
