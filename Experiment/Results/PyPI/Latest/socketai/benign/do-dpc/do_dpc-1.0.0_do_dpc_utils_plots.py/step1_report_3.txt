{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions to generate plots for training data, rocket actuators, states, and to display videos within a Jupyter Notebook environment.",
  "sources": "Input data: training_data.u, training_data.y, actuator_data, state_data, video_title; Data read from the filesystem: video files.",
  "sinks": "Embedding the video data into HTML for display in Jupyter Notebook; potential for large data handling but no direct malicious output or data leakage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables to plotting functions; video file is read from disk, encoded, and embedded into HTML for display.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. File reading is straightforward with exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard plotting operations with matplotlib, displaying data provided via function arguments. The show_video function reads a video file from disk, encodes it in base64, and embeds it into HTML for display, which is typical for Jupyter notebooks. The file access is controlled via the path_manager, and exception handling is in place to catch file read errors. There are no indications of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. Use of base64 encoding and HTML embedding is common for displaying media in notebooks. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic was identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for visualization purposes in a Jupyter Notebook environment. No malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident based on the code review. The functionality aligns with standard plotting and media display tasks without any suspicious elements.",
