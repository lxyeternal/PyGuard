  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for visualization in Jupyter notebooks, with no malicious intent or behavior. The only minor concern is the potential for path traversal via 'video_title' if not sanitized. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting this minor concern."
