{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to plot training data, rocket actuator data, rocket state data, and to display a video in a Jupyter Notebook environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from parameters, loads a video file based on a provided title, and accesses configuration paths via imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe sink is the embedded HTML for displaying videos which includes base64-encoded content.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (actuator_data, state_data, training_data, video_title) to plotting functions, and from file reading to base64 encoding and HTML display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors observed. The code uses standard libraries for plotting and file handling. The only dynamic content is the video file loading and embedding, which is controlled by user input (video_title).",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard plotting routines with no evident malicious intent. The show_video function reads a specified video file, encodes it in base64, and embeds it in HTML for display, which is typical for Jupyter Notebook videos. The filename is constructed from an input string, but this does not pose immediate security concerns unless user input is maliciously crafted to exploit path handling or content injection. No external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Usage of imports and functions appears legitimate and appropriate for visualization tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign visualization utility for plotting and displaying videos within a Jupyter Notebook environment. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are identified. The only minor consideration is ensuring that user-provided 'video_title' is validated to prevent path traversal, but this does not constitute malicious intent in the current context.",
