{
  "purpose": "Provides visualization functions for plotting training data, actuator states, system states, and displaying videos in Jupyter notebooks.",
  "sources": "Reads numpy arrays for plotting; reads video files from disk based on 'video_title' parameter.",
  "sinks": "Displays plots in the notebook; embeds base64-encoded video data into HTML for display.",
  "flows": "Data flows from numpy arrays into plots; 'video_title' is used to construct filename, which is read and encoded for display.",
  "anomalies": "Potential lack of sanitization of 'video_title' allowing path traversal; exception handling is broad but standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard visualization tasks with no malicious code or backdoors. The main concern is that 'video_title' is used directly to construct filenames without sanitization, which could enable path traversal if exploited. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. Exception handling is broad but not malicious. Overall, the code is benign with a minor security concern related to input validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for visualization in Jupyter notebooks, with no malicious intent or behavior. The only minor concern is the potential for path traversal via 'video_title' if not sanitized. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting this minor concern.",
