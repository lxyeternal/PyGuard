{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for plotting training data, actuator states, robot states, and displaying videos in Jupyter notebooks for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameters (training_data, actuator_data, state_data, video_title) and external files (video files from disk).",
  "sinks": "Generates visual outputs (plots, embedded videos) in a Jupyter notebook environment. No direct sink to external systems or network communication.",
  "flows": "Input data is received via function arguments; video file is read from disk and encoded in base64 for display.",
  "anomalies": "The show_video function reads video files from disk based on a provided filename; it constructs filenames dynamically and reads file contents for base64 encoding. The code does not sanitize or validate 'video_title' inputs, which could potentially lead to directory traversal if used maliciously with a crafted input. No other suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The functions primarily generate visualizations and display media in Jupyter notebooks. The plotting functions are straightforward and do not perform any data processing beyond visualization. The show_video function reads a video file from disk based on a constructed filename from a 'video_title' parameter, then encodes and displays it. Since 'video_title' is externally supplied, there is a potential risk if an attacker provides path traversal characters (e.g., '../../') to access unintended files. However, the filename is constructed with a fixed pattern and does not explicitly sanitize input, which could be a minor concern, but overall, no malicious behavior is evident. No network calls, external command executions, or hidden backdoors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is mainly for visualization purposes in Jupyter notebooks. The only minor concern is the potential for path traversal via 'video_title' input in 'show_video', but no malicious intent or malicious code is detected. Overall, the code appears benign and does not contain malware or significant security risks.",
