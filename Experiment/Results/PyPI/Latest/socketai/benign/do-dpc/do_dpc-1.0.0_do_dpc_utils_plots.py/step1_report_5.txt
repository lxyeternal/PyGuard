{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for plotting training data, actuator data, state data, and displaying videos within a Jupyter Notebook environment, primarily for visualization and analysis of rocket simulation or control data.",
  "sources": "Input data from 'training_data' (attributes 'u' and 'y'), 'actuator_data', 'state_data', and 'video_title' which influences file path and name.",
  "sinks": "The video display function encodes video files as base64 and embeds them into HTML for display; no other sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables ('training_data', 'actuator_data', 'state_data', 'video_title') through plotting or encoding processes, ending with display or rendering outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code uses standard libraries for visualization and file handling. The only file I/O is reading a specified video file, which is then base64-encoded for display.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard plotting libraries (matplotlib), file reading, and base64 encoding to embed videos in Jupyter notebooks. The 'show_video' function constructs file paths based on a 'path_manager' utility, checks for file existence, and reads binary video data for embedding. No code injection, suspicious network activity, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears designed for visualization purposes only. No obfuscation or malware signatures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely intended for visualization in a Jupyter notebook environment. It reads data and media files, then displays plots or videos without performing any suspicious or malicious actions.",
