{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for plotting training data, actuator states, and system states, as well as displaying videos in Jupyter Notebooks.",
  "sources": "Reading data from numpy arrays for plotting; reading video files from disk based on user input.",
  "sinks": "Displaying HTML content in Jupyter Notebook; reading and encoding video files to base64 for embedding.",
  "flows": "Data flows from numpy arrays into plots; video filename input determines reading from disk; file content is encoded and embedded into HTML for display.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling when processing files; no input sanitization on video titles; reliance on external file paths that could be manipulated; no input validation shown for video_title, potentially leading to path traversal if path_manager.get_video_path() is insecure.",
  "analysis": "The functions primarily generate plots based on numpy array inputs, which are safe as they handle internal data. The show_video function reads a video file based on a title, constructs a filename, and reads the file directly from disk. It then encodes the video content to base64 and embeds it in HTML for display in Jupyter. The only potential security concern is that video_title is used directly to construct a filename without sanitization, which could allow path traversal if path_manager.get_video_path() or the filename are manipulated maliciously. However, there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration in the provided code. The code does not perform any network operations, external command executions, or handle sensitive data beyond reading files and displaying plots. The broad exception handling could obscure errors but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard plotting and display functions for Jupyter Notebooks with minimal security risks. The only minor concern is the potential for filename manipulation via the video_title input, but this depends on the implementation of path_manager.get_video_path() and the environment in which the code runs. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage are evident.",
