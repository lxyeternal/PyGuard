  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project related to Data-Driven Predictive Control (DPC) with dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'requirements.txt', reads 'README.md', and package metadata defined in the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No explicit untrusted data sinks; standard setup procedures. No data processing or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; dependency list is static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The dependencies are typical for development and scientific computing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It loads dependencies from a requirements file and specifies package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or other risky behaviors are present. The dependencies are typical for development environments and scientific computation, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious or suspicious features. It appears to be safe and intended for standard package distribution.",
