  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project.\n- No report indicates any suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- The code only reads static files ('requirements.txt' and 'README.md') and defines package metadata and dependencies.\n- The dependencies are common scientific and development tools, with no unusual or malicious packages.\n- The 'load_requirements' function is defined but not used within the setup() call, which is typical and not suspicious.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution is present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues are present in the code. It is a straightforward setup script.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risks:** Very low, given the static and standard nature of the code.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports. Correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports give 0.1 or 0, which aligns with minimal security concern. Given the lack of suspicious activity, a score of 0.1 might be slightly high but acceptable as a conservative measure.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The only minor point is that 'load_requirements' is defined but not used, which could be considered redundant, but not a security concern.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Adjustments to scores:** Since no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present, the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Should stay at 0 or possibly be lowered to 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign setup script with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are consistent with this assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe setup.py code is safe, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated code. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
