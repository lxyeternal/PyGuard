  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, defining dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' (function defined but not used), 'README.md' for long description, static dependency list in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "The 'load_requirements()' function is defined but not invoked; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. Dependencies are standard, and no dynamic or network operations are present. The unused 'load_requirements()' function is a minor inefficiency but not a security concern. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate, though the risk could be set to 0 given the static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are consistent with the analysis; minor adjustments could set the risk score to 0, but current scores are acceptable.",
