{
  "purpose": "The class provides a simple reversible token obfuscation method using character substitution and string reversal, ostensibly for encoding tokens.",
  "sources": "The 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods read the input token and encrypted token respectively.",
  "sinks": "The 'encrypt' method outputs a transformed string; the 'decrypt' method outputs the decoded token. No other external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input token -> 'encrypt' (substitution + reversal) -> output encrypted token; encrypted token -> 'decrypt' (reverse + substitution) -> original token.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward character substitution and reversal without any complex or suspicious operations. No hardcoded credentials, network communication, or malicious payloads are present. No obfuscation beyond simple character mapping and reversal. No dynamic code execution, no external dependencies, no suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a reversible encoding scheme, replacing characters with symbols according to a predefined table, then reversing the string to produce an encrypted token. The 'decrypt' method reverses this process, applying the inverse mapping and string reversal to recover the original token. The code appears to be a basic obfuscation tool rather than malicious code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The only potential concern is if used improperly for hiding malicious payloads, but from the code alone, this is simply a reversible substitution cipher with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple reversible character substitution and reversal obfuscation mechanism with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware or suspicious anomalies. It is likely intended for simple token obfuscation rather than malicious activity.",
