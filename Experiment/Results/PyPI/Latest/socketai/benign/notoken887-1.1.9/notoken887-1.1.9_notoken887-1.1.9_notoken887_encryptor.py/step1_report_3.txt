{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple character substitution encryption and decryption methods for tokens, using a predefined replacement table to transform characters and reverse the process.",
  "sources": "The method encrypt reads the input token; the method decrypt reads the encrypted token provided as input.",
  "sinks": "The encrypt and decrypt methods process and output transformed data; no external or untrusted data flows are evident beyond function input parameters.",
  "flows": "encrypt takes a token, applies character substitution, reverses the string, and prepends 'ENC#'; decrypt takes an encrypted token, removes the prefix, reverses it, and applies the reverse substitution to obtain the original token.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The transformation is straightforward; no code injection, backdoors, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic substitution cipher with a fixed table, providing simple reversible encryption/decryption functions. The class uses static mappings for character substitution, and the methods are simple string manipulations involving character replacement, string reversal, and prefix addition or removal. The approach is naive and not suitable for security-sensitive purposes but does not exhibit malicious intent or malicious behaviors. No external inputs, network communications, or insecure practices are evident. The code structure and logic are transparent and standard for such simple ciphers.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to implement a simple character substitution encryption scheme without any malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is insecure for protecting sensitive data but does not pose a malware or supply chain risk. There are no obfuscated or malicious elements present.",
