{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods to encode and decode tokens by replacing characters with symbol mappings and reversing the string, likely for obfuscation or simple encryption.",
  "sources": "The 'encrypt' method reads the input 'token'; the 'decrypt' method reads the 'encrypted_token' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly send data over the network, access system files, or perform any I/O beyond returning transformed strings.",
  "flows": "The 'encrypt' method maps characters to symbols, reverses the string, and prepends 'ENC#'. The 'decrypt' method removes the prefix, reverses the string back, and translates symbols back to characters.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a character substitution table and string reversal for 'encryption', which is a trivial obfuscation technique. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. No suspicious network activity or system modification is evident.",
  "analysis": "The class performs character substitution based on a predefined mapping, followed by string reversal and a prefix addition for 'encryption'. The 'decrypt' method reverses these steps. The mappings seem consistent and do not involve external dependencies or malicious code. No evidence of data leakage, system interference, or malware features. The approach appears to be simple obfuscation rather than secure encryption. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected, and the code is straightforward and self-contained.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement a basic reversible obfuscation mechanism using character replacement and string reversal. It contains no malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It may be used for lightweight token hiding but is not suitable for secure encryption. Overall, the code is benign.",
