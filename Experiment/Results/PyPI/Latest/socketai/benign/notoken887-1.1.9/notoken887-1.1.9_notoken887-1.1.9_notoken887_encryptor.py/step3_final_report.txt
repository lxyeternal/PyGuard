{
  "purpose": "A reversible character substitution cipher with string reversal, intended for lightweight obfuscation of tokens.",
  "sources": "The 'encrypt' method reads input characters and applies a static substitution table; the 'decrypt' method reads the encrypted token, removes the prefix, and applies the inverse substitution.",
  "sinks": "The substitution and reversal process acts as a sink for the input data, transforming it into an obfuscated form; the inverse process restores the original token.",
  "flows": "Input token -> substitution table -> string reversal -> output with 'ENC#' prefix; for decryption, input with prefix -> remove prefix -> reverse -> inverse substitution -> original token.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a static substitution table with no dynamic or external data; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present; the 'ENC#' prefix is mentioned in reports but not in the actual code provided.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple, deterministic substitution cipher combined with string reversal, serving as a lightweight obfuscation method. No external dependencies, network activity, or system modifications are present. The substitution tables are static and do not contain secrets. The process is straightforward and reversible, with no malicious payloads or backdoors. The main concern is that such simple schemes are insecure for protecting sensitive data but do not indicate malicious intent. The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with high confidence (0.9+). The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is low (~0.2), and the security risk score is minimal (~0.1), all consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, simple reversible substitution cipher used for lightweight obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities that would pose a significant threat. The assigned scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
