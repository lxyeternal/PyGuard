{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods to encode (encrypt) and decode (decrypt) tokens by substituting characters based on a predefined mapping and reversing the string.",
  "sources": "Input is taken via the 'token' parameter in encrypt(), and 'encrypted_token' parameter in decrypt(). The data read is the input string that is to be encoded or decoded.",
  "sinks": "The methods output transformed strings, but do not directly affect system state, files, or network. No external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed via character replacement according to 'replacement_table', then reversed for the encrypted form; decrypt reverses this process to restore original data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or system modifications are present. The code performs simple character substitution and string reversal. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The class solely performs a deterministic character substitution cipher with reversible transformations, implemented via a fixed mapping. The encrypt() method transforms each character based on the 'replacement_table' and then reverses the string, prepending 'ENC#'. The decrypt() method strips the prefix, reverses the string, and then maps characters back to original. There are no indications of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations. The code appears as a straightforward, custom, reversible encoding scheme with no external dependencies or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a simple reversible substitution cipher for encoding and decoding tokens. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It is a benign obfuscation method, not malicious malware. No security risks are evident from this isolated code.",
