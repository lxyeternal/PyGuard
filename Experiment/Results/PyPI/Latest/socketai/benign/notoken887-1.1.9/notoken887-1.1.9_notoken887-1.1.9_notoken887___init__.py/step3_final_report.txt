  "purpose": "Assessment of supply chain security and malicious behavior in open source Python dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input reading functions (stdin, environment variables, files), dynamic code execution (eval()/exec()), external modules, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code patterns.",
  "sinks": "Console output, file writing, network communication, system commands, dynamic code execution pathways.",
  "flows": "Input sources through processing functions to sinks, especially where eval()/exec() or network connections are involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() on untrusted data, obfuscated variable names, hardcoded credentials, dynamic imports, suspicious network domains, unusual code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code with eval()/exec() and obfuscated patterns indicates potential for malicious activity, especially if untrusted input is processed. Absence of code or benign patterns suggest low risk. Suspicious indicators are moderate, leading to a cautious malware score. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are confirmed in benign-looking code. The scores reflect suspicion levels, with higher scores in reports indicating signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, but no definitive malware presence. The analysis aligns with the scores, which are consistent with the observed patterns and descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are generally consistent with their scoring. Suspicious patterns in Report 2 justify a moderate malware score (0.4) and obfuscation (0.6). Reports with no code or benign analysis appropriately have zero or low scores. Overall, the scoring accurately reflects the assessed risk levels based on the available data.",
