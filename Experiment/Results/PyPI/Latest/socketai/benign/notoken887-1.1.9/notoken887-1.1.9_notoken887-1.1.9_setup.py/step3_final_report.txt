  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools with suspicious contact metadata.",
  "sources": "Metadata fields: author, author_email, url",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing; static setup configuration",
  "flows": "No data flow; static configuration without dynamic input or output",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email 'hitler@gmail.com' and URL 'https://thugging.org'; no malicious code or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script defining package metadata. No dynamic or malicious code is present. The only anomalies are unprofessional contact info and a suspicious URL, which could indicate malicious intent or sabotage but do not constitute active malicious behavior. Malware score is correctly 0; obfuscation is absent. Security risk scores vary slightly, reflecting metadata suspicion rather than code-based vulnerabilities. The highest risk score (0.6) is justified by metadata concerns but overstates actual threat. Overall, the package is benign in code but warrants caution due to metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with suspicious contact information but no malicious payloads or obfuscation. The malware and obfuscation scores are 0. consistent with the absence of malicious code. The moderate security risk score (~0.3-0.4) reflects metadata suspicion. Overall, the package is safe in functionality but should be reviewed for metadata integrity before distribution.",
