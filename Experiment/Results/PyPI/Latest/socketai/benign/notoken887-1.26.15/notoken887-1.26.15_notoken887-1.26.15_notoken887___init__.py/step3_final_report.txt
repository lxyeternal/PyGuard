  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing or network communication tasks without signs of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, external files or network connections",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, system commands, file writes",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, env vars) through processing functions to sinks (network, files)",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity; code is minimal or incomplete",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently identify no signs of malware or obfuscation, with scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation. Risk scores are low (~0.2-0.3), justified by the lack of suspicious patterns but acknowledging incomplete or minimal code snippets. Confidence levels vary but remain high where code is complete; lower where code is incomplete. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The cautious assessments are appropriate given the limited information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The overall security risk is minimal. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
