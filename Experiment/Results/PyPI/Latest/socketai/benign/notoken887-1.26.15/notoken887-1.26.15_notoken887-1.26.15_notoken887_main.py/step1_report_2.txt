{
  "purpose": "The code provides command-line utilities for encrypting and decrypting Python scripts using the TokenCryptor class from the notoken887.encryptor module.",
  "sources": "Reading input file content with open(input_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8')",
  "sinks": "Writing output file content with open(output_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8')",
  "flows": "Input file content is read, processed (encrypted or decrypted), then written to output file; encrypted code includes embedded encrypted data and code that decrypts and executes it at runtime",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic execution via exec in run_decrypted_code(), embedding encrypted code in a string, and decrypt/decrypting logic. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. The code relies on an external module 'notoken887.encryptor'.",
  "analysis": "The script encrypts Python code by replacing lines with encrypted versions, then embeds a decryption and execution routine. The decrypt function extracts encrypted data from the code and decrypts it for execution. No suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are evident. The use of exec for runtime code execution, while potentially risky, is typical for obfuscation or encryption schemes, not malicious behavior per se. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads detected. The code appears to be a utility for secure code handling, with possible misuse if used maliciously, but nothing indicates malicious intent within this module itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for encrypting and decrypting Python scripts using a specified cryptor. It employs runtime decryption and execution but does not contain malicious payloads or suspicious behavior. Its use of exec warrants caution but is not inherently malicious. Overall, no malware or malicious intent is detected.",
