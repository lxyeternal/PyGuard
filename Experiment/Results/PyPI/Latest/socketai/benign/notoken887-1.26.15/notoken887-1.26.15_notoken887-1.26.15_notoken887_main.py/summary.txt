  "conclusion": "The code functions as an obfuscation utility that encrypts source code and executes it dynamically at runtime. While no malicious payloads are present, the pattern of decrypting and executing code on the fly introduces security risks, especially if the encrypted content is untrusted. The current analysis suggests low malware likelihood but high potential security risk due to runtime code execution. The scores should reflect this balance, with low malware probability but significant security concern."
