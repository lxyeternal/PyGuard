{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods for encoding and decoding strings through character replacement transformations, acting as a simple cipher or obfuscation tool.",
  "sources": "Input data is received through the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods as method arguments.",
  "sinks": "Output data is returned from the methods; no other sinks such as network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed character-by-character in 'encrypt' to produce an encoded string, and in 'decrypt' to recover the original string, via sequential replacements.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs extensive character replacements for obfuscation but contains no hardcoded secrets, environment variable use, or unusual code structures. No malicious backdoors or hidden functionalities are apparent. The code appears solely as an encoding/decoding utility.",
  "analysis": "The class offers straightforward character substitution methods for string encoding and decoding, mapping standard characters to symbols and vice versa. The implementation uses chained replace calls, which are standard for simple ciphers but can be inefficient. There are no indications of malicious activities such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The code is clearly structured, focused solely on string transformation, and does not include obfuscated or suspicious logic beyond simple replacement mappings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign character substitution utility with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as a basic cipher or obfuscator without any malicious intent.",
