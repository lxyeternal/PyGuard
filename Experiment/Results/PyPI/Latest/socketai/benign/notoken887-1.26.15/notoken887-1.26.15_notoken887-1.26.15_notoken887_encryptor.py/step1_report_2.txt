{
  "purpose": "This class provides methods to encode and decode strings by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa, serving as a simple obfuscation or encoding scheme.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the parameters 'string' in encrypt() and 'encrypted_token' in decrypt(). No external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Output is returned as a string. There are no sinks where data is sent to external systems, files, or network resources.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed character-by-character through chained replace() calls in both methods, converting characters to emojis and back.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, using chained replace() calls for encoding and decoding. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation techniques are used.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a reversible character substitution cipher, replacing each character with a unique emoji and vice versa. The implementation is static and purely functional, with no signs of malicious intent. The code does not interact with external systems, handle untrusted inputs in a dangerous way, or include any hidden or malicious logic. The purpose appears to be simple obfuscation, not malicious activity or supply chain attack. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected beyond basic character replacement.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign character encoding/decoding utility designed for obfuscation purposes. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is a straightforward implementation without hidden or malicious intent.",
