  "purpose": "A class providing character substitution encoding and decoding using emojis for obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Input string to encrypt or encrypted token to decrypt via method parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input string passes through chained replace calls to produce encrypted output; reverse process for decryption.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static substitution cipher with extensive replace chains.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static character-to-emoji substitution for encoding and decoding. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or access external data. The extensive replace chains are inefficient but not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, environment variables, or obfuscation techniques beyond simple replacements are present. The logic is transparent and benign, serving as a simple obfuscation utility.",
  "conclusion": "The class implements a basic, static character substitution cipher with no malicious intent or malicious code. It is a benign utility for encoding and decoding strings. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.1, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate, though a score of 0 for obfuscation and risk could also be justified given the code's transparency.",
