{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple substitution cipher for encoding and decoding text messages by replacing characters with emoji symbols.",
  "sources": "The methods 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' process input strings and encrypted tokens respectively, using string replacements.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources, perform network operations, or access sensitive system information.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed character-by-character through sequential replacements during encryption and reverse during decryption.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses extensive chained replace calls for character substitution, which is inefficient but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or system modifications are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two methods for character substitution using replace. These methods act as a simple cipher, converting characters to emojis and back. The substitution appears straightforward and solely involves character replacement without external input or side effects. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or backdoors. The structure is clear, and no obfuscation or hidden logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign character substitution cipher implementation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code serves a simple encoding/decoding purpose without harmful behavior.",
