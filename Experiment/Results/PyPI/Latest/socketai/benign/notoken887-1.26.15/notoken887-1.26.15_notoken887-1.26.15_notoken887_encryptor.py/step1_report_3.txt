{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods to encode and decode strings by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa, effectively serving as a simple substitution cipher.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from method parameters 'string' and 'encrypted_token'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leakage, system modification, or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed via character replacements in 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods, with data flow confined within these transformations.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses extensive character replacement for encoding, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or network activity is present. No obfuscated code techniques are used. No external system calls or suspicious modules are imported.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a straightforward substitution cipher by replacing characters with emojis in 'encrypt' and reversing these replacements in 'decrypt'. The replacement mappings are extensive but static, and the methods do not perform any network activity, file operations, or system modifications. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated behavior. The design appears intended for simple encoding rather than security or malicious purposes. The absence of external data access or system interaction indicates low risk. The only potential concern is misuse for hiding malicious data, but as a code review, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign character substitution cipher implementation with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It neither exfiltrates data nor executes harmful actions. The code is straightforward, static, and does not contain any suspicious elements.",
