{
  "purpose": "Defines package metadata and entry points for the 'notoken887' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads static metadata fields such as name, version, author, description, url, classifiers, and entry_points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external effects in this setup script.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; static metadata used to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org'); mention of 'obfuscation test lib' in description, but no actual obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with no embedded malicious code or dynamic behaviors. The only notable anomalies are unprofessional contact info and URL, which could be used maliciously if combined with malicious module code. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code and obfuscation, assigning malware scores of 0. and low security risk scores (0.2-0.3) due to metadata suspicion. The potential for malicious activity depends on the content of the 'main' module, which is outside this snippet. The setup script itself is benign, but metadata warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, benign configuration with suspicious contact info and URL. No evidence of malicious code or obfuscation. The primary concern is metadata that could be used maliciously if the associated 'main' module contains harmful code. Overall, the code itself is safe, and scores are appropriate.",
