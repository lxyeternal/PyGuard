  "purpose": "A minimal, static setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields within the setup() call (name, version, author, description, classifiers).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is declarative and static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static setup script with no dynamic behavior, external data, or code execution. All reports agree that it is benign, serving as a placeholder package. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious activity are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all correctly assigned as 0, reflecting the benign and straightforward nature of the code. The package's purpose as a placeholder aligns with the lack of any suspicious signals. The code's simplicity and static metadata confirm the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are justified. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
