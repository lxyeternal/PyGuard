  "purpose": "Define a placeholder Python package setup configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static values in the setup() function such as name, version, author, author_email, description, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields; minimal information but not suspicious or malicious. No dynamic code, no secrets, no code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It contains static metadata with no user input, environment variable usage, or code execution. There are no indicators of malicious behavior such as hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The package appears to be a placeholder with no harmful intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It serves as a minimal placeholder package setup.",
