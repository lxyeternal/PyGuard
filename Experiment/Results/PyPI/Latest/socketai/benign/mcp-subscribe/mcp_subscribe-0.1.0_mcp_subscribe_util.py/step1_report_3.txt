  "purpose": "The function asynchronously calls a tool based on a URI scheme, parsing query parameters as arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'uri' object (scheme, host, query) and the 'session' object for calling 'call_tool'.",
  "sinks": "The 'session.call_tool' method executes a potentially external or untrusted tool with provided arguments.",
  "flows": "URI scheme and query parameters flow into 'call_tool', which then executes based on user-controlled input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The code parses external input and invokes a method based on the URI scheme and host.",
  "analysis": "The code inspects the URI scheme; if it is 'tool', it parses the query parameters into arguments, extracts the host as the tool name, and then calls 'session.call_tool' with these arguments. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code, but the invocation of 'call_tool' based on URI data could pose security risks if the 'call_tool' implementation is not secure or if untrusted input is used to control tool invocation. Since 'call_tool' is an external method, potential risks depend on its internal implementation, which is not shown here. The code itself does not contain malicious behavior but allows dynamic tool invocation based on external input, which could be dangerous if misused.",
  "conclusion": "The code is relatively straightforward and does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. Its security depends on the implementation of 'session.call_tool' and validation of 'uri' components. It could be exploited if the input URI is maliciously crafted to invoke unintended tools or commands, but based solely on this snippet, no malicious intent is evident.",
