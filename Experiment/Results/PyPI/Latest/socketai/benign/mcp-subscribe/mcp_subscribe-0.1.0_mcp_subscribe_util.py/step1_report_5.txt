{
  "purpose": "To parse a URI with a 'tool' scheme and invoke a tool with the extracted arguments via an asynchronous session call.",
  "sources": "The URI object (uri) providing scheme, host, and query components.",
  "sinks": "The session.call_tool method, which executes a tool identified by name with supplied arguments.",
  "flows": "The code extracts arguments from the URI query, then passes the tool name and arguments to session.call_tool.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs observed. The use of parse_qs and await appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if the URI scheme is 'tool', then parses query parameters into a dictionary, handling single and multiple values. It assigns the host as the tool name, then asynchronously calls session.call_tool with these parameters. The logic appears straightforward, with no evidence of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious data handling. No insecure operations, such as unsafe data execution or external network calls beyond the intended method, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs safe URI parsing and method invocation based on the URI scheme. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It functions as a typical URI handler invoking tools via an async session.",
