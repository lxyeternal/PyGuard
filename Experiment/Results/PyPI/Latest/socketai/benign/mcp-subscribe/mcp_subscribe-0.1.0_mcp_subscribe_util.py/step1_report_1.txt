{
  "purpose": "To parse a URI and invoke a tool with query parameters if the URI scheme is 'tool'.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'uri', which is expected to be a URI object with 'scheme', 'host', and 'query' attributes.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'session.call_tool(name, args)', which invokes an external session method potentially executing the tool identified by 'name' with provided arguments.",
  "flows": "The URI scheme is checked; if 'tool', then query parameters are parsed into 'args', and 'session.call_tool' is invoked with the host as 'name' and parsed args.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of 'parse_qs' and asynchronous call appear standard. No obfuscated code or malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code extracts query parameters from a URI and conditionally calls an asynchronous session method to execute a tool identified by the URI's host. The parameters are safely parsed, and the function only proceeds if the scheme matches 'tool'. No data leaks, injection, or malicious behavior detected. The function's behavior relies on external 'session' and 'uri' objects, but within this code, nothing appears malicious or suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a straightforward URI parsing and tool invocation process without evident malicious intent or security issues. It properly checks the scheme before processing and safely parses query parameters. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
