{
  "purpose": "This code defines an asynchronous function to parse a URI and invoke a tool via a session object based on the URI's scheme and query parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads the URI object (uri.scheme, uri.host, uri.query) and the session object (session.call_tool).",
  "sinks": "Calls session.call_tool with the tool name and arguments, which may invoke external or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Parses the URI's query parameters into args, then calls session.call_tool with the host as tool name and parsed args.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns detected. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious code. The code's behavior depends on the input URI and session implementation.",
  "analysis": "The function verifies the URI scheme is 'tool', then extracts query parameters into a dictionary, converting single-value lists into scalar values. It uses the URI host as the tool name, which could be potentially manipulated if input is untrusted. The function then calls an asynchronous method on the session object with these parameters. There are no hardcoded secrets, no network connections or data leaks within this code snippet, and it relies on external inputs. The main concern is that if an attacker controls the URI, they could specify malicious tool names or parameters, but that depends on the broader system context. Overall, this is a straightforward parameter parsing and function invocation with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, parameterized invocation of a tool based on a URI scheme, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware within this fragment. Its security depends on the trusted context of the URI source and the implementation of session.call_tool, which is outside this code's scope.",
