{
  "purpose": "The code implements a proxy server for MCP that forwards requests to a base server, manages subscriptions, and polls resources for updates.",
  "sources": "Data is read from command-line arguments, environment variables (e.g., PYTHONUNBUFFERED), network calls via 'call_tool_from_uri', and MCP requests/responses.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can reach the network via 'call_tool_from_uri', server responses, or logging outputs; resource contents are retrieved and possibly leaked.",
  "flows": "Inputs from command-line/env -> MCP request handlers -> call_tool_from_uri or base server methods -> potential data leakage or modification; subscription polling periodically fetches resource data and updates server.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed. Use of 'hashlib.md5' is standard for content hashing. The code's structure is typical; no obfuscated patterns detected. No suspicious network domains or backdoors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a proxy for MCP with subscription polling, forwarding requests to a base server, and managing resource updates. It utilizes standard asynchronous patterns, handles errors gracefully, and does not include malicious behavior or obfuscated code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual logic are present. The use of 'call_tool_from_uri' for resource checks is consistent with intended functionality. No signs of malware such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or covert channels are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate MCP proxy implementation with resource polling and request forwarding. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided source. It is a standard, well-structured application code for resource subscription management.",
