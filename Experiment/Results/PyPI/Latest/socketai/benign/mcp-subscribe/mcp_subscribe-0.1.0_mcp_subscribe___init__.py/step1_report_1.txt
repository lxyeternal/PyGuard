  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple utility or script that performs specific functions, potentially related to data processing or system operations. Without additional context, it is not explicitly clear, but no obvious malicious intent is apparent.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are likely read from standard input, function parameters, or external files, although no explicit input sources are visible in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network requests, or file operations. However, in the visible code, there are no explicit insecure sinks such as network transmissions or file modifications with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (if any) through processing functions towards output or system calls. No suspicious or unusual data flow paths are evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are observed. The code uses straightforward syntax and standard library features.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a basic implementation with standard Python features. There are no signs of malicious payloads such as code injection, network exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious in itself. Without specific functionalities or external inputs shown, no malicious behavior or security risks are apparent. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code seems benign and straightforward, with no suspicious activities or anomalies detected.",
