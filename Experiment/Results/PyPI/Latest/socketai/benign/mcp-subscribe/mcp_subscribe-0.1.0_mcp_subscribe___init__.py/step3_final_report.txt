  "purpose": "Analysis of supply chain security and malicious potential of the Python dependency based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input reading from environment variables, function parameters, data sources, and dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network connections, system modifications, or malicious payloads via eval/exec or indirect function calls.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables leading to sinks like eval/exec, network communication, or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation patterns, dynamic execution, complex string manipulations, indirect function calls, and inconsistent code patterns suggestive of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "Most reports describe benign code with no suspicious activity, consistent low malware and obfuscation scores, and high confidence. Report 5 indicates obfuscation and dynamic execution, with scores (malware=0.6, obfuscated=0.8, securityRisk=0.65) justified by the described suspicious patterns. The scores across reports are internally consistent, with benign reports aligning with low scores and the suspicious code appropriately reflecting higher suspicion. The overall assessment suggests a low to moderate security risk, with the highest concern centered on report 5's obfuscation and dynamic features.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are generally consistent and justified. The high obfuscation and malware scores in report 5 are appropriate given the described suspicious patterns. No further adjustments are necessary unless additional code evidence emerges.",
