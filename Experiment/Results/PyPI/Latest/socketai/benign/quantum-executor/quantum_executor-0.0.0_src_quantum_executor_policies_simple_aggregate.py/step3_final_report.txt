  "purpose": "Merge job results by summing measurement counts from nested dictionaries containing 'ResultData' objects or dicts.",
  "sources": "The nested dictionaries 'results' containing 'ResultData' objects or dicts, and 'policy_data' parameter.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; data is processed in-memory and returned without external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Iterates over 'results' to accumulate counts into 'merged_results', passing 'policy_data' unchanged.",
  "anomalies": "Type check 'isinstance(result_data, dict)' on 'ResultData' objects; no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward data merging, summing counts from nested structures. It only checks if 'result_data' is a dict, which is a minimal validation. No external calls, network activity, or code execution occurs. The logic is benign, serving as a simple utility for aggregating quantum measurement results. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected. The type check on 'ResultData' is cautious but not malicious; potential malformed data is a minor concern but not security-critical.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data merging function with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It performs in-memory aggregation safely. The minimal validation does not introduce security risks. Overall, the code is safe, non-obfuscated, and appropriate for its purpose.",
