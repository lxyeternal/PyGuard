  "purpose": "Merge job results by summing measurement counts from nested ResultData objects.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'results' parameter (nested dictionaries containing lists of 'ResultData' objects).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or system effects; function only processes in-memory data.",
  "flows": "Extracts 'ResultData' objects from nested results, iterates through them, and sums counts into 'merged_results'.",
  "anomalies": "Type checking with 'isinstance(result_data, dict)' on 'ResultData' objects, but no evidence of malicious code. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward merge operation, summing integer counts from nested 'ResultData' objects stored in a nested dictionary structure. The check 'isinstance(result_data, dict)' suggests that 'ResultData' objects are expected to behave like dictionaries, but this is standard in data processing. There are no dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious data handling. The code appears to be a typical data aggregation function with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data merging function with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It processes in-memory data structures safely without external dependencies or side effects.",
