{
  "purpose": "Merge job results by summing measurement counts from nested ResultData objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'results' dictionary, specifically from nested ResultData objects.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks are evident; the code only processes and returns aggregated results.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'results' input through nested loops, extracting 'ResultData' objects, then summing counts into 'merged_results'.",
  "anomalies": "The code expects 'ResultData' objects to be dicts containing bitstring counts; the isinstance check may be overly permissive but is not suspicious in itself. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data aggregation from nested dictionaries, with checks to ensure 'result_data' is a dict and counts are integers before summing. It imports only standard 'typing' modules and a type for type checking purposes. No code injection, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. No obfuscation or malicious code observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign data merging operation for quantum measurement results. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks; it functions solely as a data processing utility.",
