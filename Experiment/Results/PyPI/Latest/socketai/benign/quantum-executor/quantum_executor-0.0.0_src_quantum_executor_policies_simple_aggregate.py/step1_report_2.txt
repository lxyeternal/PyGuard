{
  "purpose": "The code merges measurement counts from quantum job results by summing counts associated with bitstrings.",
  "sources": "Results data from the 'results' parameter, specifically from nested dictionaries containing 'ResultData' objects or dicts.",
  "sinks": "The 'merged_results' dictionary where counts are accumulated; no external sinks or data exfiltration points are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'results' through nested loops, with 'result_data' checked and used to update 'merged_results'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The code performs straightforward data aggregation.",
  "analysis": "The function processes nested dictionaries of results, iterates through each 'ResultData' object or dict, and sums counts for each bitstring. No external calls, network operations, or environment variable usages are present. The code is a simple, well-structured merging routine without any obfuscation or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign data merging utility for quantum measurement results with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
