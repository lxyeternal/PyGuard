{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to merge quantum computation results by summing measurement counts from multiple ResultData objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'results' parameter, specifically from nested dictionaries containing lists of 'ResultData' objects, and also reads 'policy_data' but does not use it.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; there are no data outputs to external systems, network connections, or file writes. The function only processes and returns data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'results' through nested iteration into 'merged_results' by summing counts; 'policy_data' is passed through unchanged. No external data or untrusted input influences system behavior beyond the input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code checks if 'result_data' is a dict, which is inconsistent with the expected 'ResultData' object type, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The function processes nested input data structures, summing integer counts from 'ResultData' objects. There is no use of external system calls, network activity, or dangerous operations. The check for 'result_data' being a dict suggests some flexibility or defensive coding but does not raise security concerns. The code appears clean, straightforward, and intended solely for merging measurement counts. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign data aggregation task without any malicious intent. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured merge function for quantum measurement results.",
