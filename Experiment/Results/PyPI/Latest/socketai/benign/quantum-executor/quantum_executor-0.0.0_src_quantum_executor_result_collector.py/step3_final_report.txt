{
  "purpose": "Implement thread-safe collectors for aggregating job results, including registration, storage, retrieval, and merging of results in a concurrent environment.",
  "sources": "In-memory data structures such as nested_results, _job_mapping, and internal variables within classes like ResultCollector and MergedResultCollector.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; data flows are confined within in-memory structures and synchronization primitives.",
  "flows": "Job registration updates nested_results and _job_mapping; result storage updates JobResult instances; get_results and get_jobs read from nested_results; merging functions set and retrieve merged results and policy data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, external communications, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard thread synchronization mechanisms with ReadWriteLock and threading events to manage concurrent access to in-memory data structures. It manages job registration, result storage, and merging with proper locking. No external network or file operations are present. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code's purpose is clear, and its implementation aligns with typical patterns for thread-safe data management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured, thread-safe implementation for managing and merging job results. No malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation is evident. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score are justified and appropriate.",
