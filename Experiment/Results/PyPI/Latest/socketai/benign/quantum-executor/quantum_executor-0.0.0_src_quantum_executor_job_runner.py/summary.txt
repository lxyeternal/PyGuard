  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard helper function for quantum job execution. No malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to broad exception handling, but no vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: ~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
