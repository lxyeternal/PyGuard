{
  "purpose": "Initialize and configure the Quantum Executor Module by setting version, importing necessary components, and configuring logging.",
  "sources": "The module imports components from relative modules (.dispatch, .executor, .virtual_provider) and reads the __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external data output is evident.",
  "flows": "The code sets up module metadata and logging configuration without data flow or input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The logging setup is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining module metadata and importing necessary classes. It only configures logging and does not process any untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated code. The absence of dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or data leaks indicates low risk.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a benign initialization script for a quantum executor package with no malicious behavior detected.",
