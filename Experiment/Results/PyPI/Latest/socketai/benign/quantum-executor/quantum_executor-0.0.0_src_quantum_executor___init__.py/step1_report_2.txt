  "purpose": "Define a quantum executor module with versioning, logging configuration, and import statements for core components.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: .dispatch, .executor, .virtual_provider.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no external data or user input processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only sets up imports, version, and logging.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard module setup without suspicious code patterns or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a module with version info, sets up logging, and imports core classes from local modules. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no external data handling are present. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file or main module setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with no malicious intent or security issues. It merely imports and configures basic components and logging.",
