  "sources": "Import statements for Dispatch, QuantumExecutor, VirtualProvider; logging configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points identified.",
  "flows": "Logging configuration flows into the overall package setup; import statements do not involve data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious code patterns. No apparent anomalies or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes module metadata, imports three components from local modules, and configures logging. No user input handling, network operations, or data processing present. No signs of malicious behavior or security issues are detected. The code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module setup with imports and logging configuration. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
