  "purpose": "Initialize the Quantum Executor Module by setting version and importing core components.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reading; static code only.",
  "sinks": "No sink points where untrusted data could cause vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets up imports and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; straightforward import and configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module with version info, imports specific classes from internal modules, and configures logging. There are no dynamic evaluations, external inputs, or data handling beyond static import statements. The logging setup is standard and does not contain secrets or insecure configurations. No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code appears to be a typical initialization script for a package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely sets up version info, imports core classes, and configures logging.",
