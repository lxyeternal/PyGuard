  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module setup: defining version, importing local components, and configuring logging.\n- No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is standard for a Python package's initialization or main module.\n\n---\n\n### Issue Presence and Code Review:\n- **Issue confirmation:** All reports agree that the code is benign and standard. I find no evidence of malicious code, vulnerabilities, or anomalies.\n- **Logical flaws or mistakes:** None are evident. The code is minimal, clear, and well-structured.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Obfuscated score (0 or 1):** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and clarity.\n- **Malware score (0 or 1):** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Security risk score:** Most reports assign 0, with one report assigning 0.1. Given the absence of any risky behavior, a score of 0 is more appropriate. The 0.1 seems unjustified unless considering the logging configuration, but since it’s standard, it doesn't pose a risk.\n\n### Risk Score Justification:\n- Since there's no dynamic code, external data handling, or secrets, the overall security risk should be **0**.\n- The only point to consider is the logging configuration, but since it’s standard and not exposing sensitive info, it doesn't increase risk.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All scores are consistent with the code analysis.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n### Overall assessment:\nThe code is a typical module initialization script with no security issues, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are mostly appropriate, with the exception of the one report assigning a 0.1 risk score, which should be adjusted to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n- The scores should reflect no malware, no obfuscation, and no security risk.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the code's straightforward nature.",
