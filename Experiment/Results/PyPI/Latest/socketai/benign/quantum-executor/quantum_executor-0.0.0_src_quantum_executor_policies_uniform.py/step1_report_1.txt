  "purpose": "Distribute quantum circuit execution across multiple backends with an equal shot count.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'circuit', 'shots', 'backends', 'policy_data'.",
  "sinks": "dispatch.add_job() method where jobs are scheduled with specific backend and circuit data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) are used to compute 'backends_shots'; these values flow into 'dispatch.add_job()' as backend_shots.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data; the code primarily distributes workload uniformly without malicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code computes the total number of backends, divides 'shots' evenly among them, and distributes remaining shots. It then creates a Dispatch object and adds jobs for each backend with copies of the circuit. No external data is fetched or sent, and no suspicious code paths or obfuscated constructs are present. The logic appears straightforward and intended solely for workload distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple workload distribution function for quantum circuits without any malicious intent. It does not perform any harmful operations or contain hidden backdoors. The overall security risk is minimal.",
