  "purpose": "Distribute quantum circuit execution evenly across multiple backends.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters: circuit, shots, backends, virtual provider, policy data.",
  "sinks": "Adds jobs to the Dispatch object with circuit copies and assigned shots.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> calculation of total backends -> distribution of shots -> creation of Dispatch -> adding jobs with circuit copies and shot counts.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in variable name 'bakends_num' (should be 'backends_num'), but this does not affect functionality or security.",
  "analysis": "The code calculates total backends, evenly distributes shots, handles remainders, and schedules jobs via Dispatch. No external data fetching, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The typo is minor and non-malicious. The logic is straightforward and transparent, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward workload distribution function for quantum circuits. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The minor typo does not impact security or functionality. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
