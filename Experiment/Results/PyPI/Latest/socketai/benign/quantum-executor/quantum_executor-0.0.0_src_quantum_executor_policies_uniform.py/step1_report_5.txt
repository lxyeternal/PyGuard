{
  "purpose": "Distribute a quantum circuit and shot count uniformly across multiple backends for execution.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'circuit', 'shots', 'backends', '_virtual_provider', 'policy_data'. The code reads input data from these parameters.",
  "sinks": "The 'dispatch.add_job' method where untrusted data such as 'circuit', 'backend_name', 'provider_name', and 'shots' are used to schedule jobs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> 'dispatch.add_job' calls with 'circuit.copy()', 'provider_name', 'backend_name', 'backend_shots' -> Job scheduling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code performs standard distribution of workload without suspicious behavior. No obfuscated code, no unusual data flows, or hidden network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily distributes the total shots evenly among backends, handling remainder distribution correctly. It creates a Dispatch object and adds jobs with the provided circuit and calculated shots. There are no external data leaks, no network communications, and no system modifications. Usage of 'circuit.copy()' is standard for avoiding side-effects. The logic appears straightforward and benign, serving a workload distribution purpose. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple workload distribution function with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs standard operations for job scheduling without any suspicious actions or security concerns.",
