  "purpose": "Exporting local Qiskit Aer provider and backend classes for compatibility with qBraid.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'device' and 'provider' modules within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "Importing modules and exposing classes via __all__, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes from local modules and defines __all__ for package exports. It contains no logic, no data processing, and no external interactions. The imported modules are assumed to be part of the same package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward module setup for exporting classes, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
