{
  "purpose": "Defines and exports classes for local Qiskit Aer provider and backend, compatible with qBraid.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '.device' and '.provider'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imports flow from local modules to the exported list, no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from local modules and exposes them via __all__. There are no external data inputs, no network communication, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or suspicious logic. The structure is typical for Python package exports and does not contain any malicious or malicious-looking constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module that exports specific classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present.",
