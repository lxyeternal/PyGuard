{
  "purpose": "Provides local Qiskit Aer provider and backend classes compatible with qBraid.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .device and .provider",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no external network communication or data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; imports are local and define classes for use within the package",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, straightforward module exports; no anomalies observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from local modules and exposes them via __all__ for package use. It is a simple, standard module definition with no external data handling, no environment variables, and no network activity. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger package providing Qiskit backend classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard module export code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
