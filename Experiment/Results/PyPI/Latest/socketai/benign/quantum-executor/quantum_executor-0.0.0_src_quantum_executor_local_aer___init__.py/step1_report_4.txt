  "purpose": "Exports LocalAERBackend and LocalAERProvider classes for a local Qiskit Aer provider setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements from device and provider modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leaks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imported modules are exposed via __all__, no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports two classes from internal modules and defines the public API via __all__. It does not contain any user input handling, network operations, or security-sensitive operations. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module that re-exports classes for Qiskit backend providers. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this code fragment.",
