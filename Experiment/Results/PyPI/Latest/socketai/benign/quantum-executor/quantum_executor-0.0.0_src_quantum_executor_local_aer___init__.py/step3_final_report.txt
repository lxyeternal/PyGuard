  "purpose": "Exports LocalAERBackend and LocalAERProvider classes for Qiskit Aer provider, compatible with qBraid.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.device and .provider).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leaks, no network communication.",
  "flows": "Import of classes from local modules; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward module export with no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports two classes from local modules and exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns confirm its safety. The security of the overall package depends on the imported modules, but the snippet itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
