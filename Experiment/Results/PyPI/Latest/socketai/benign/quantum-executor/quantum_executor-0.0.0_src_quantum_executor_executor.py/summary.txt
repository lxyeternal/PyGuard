  "conclusion": "The code allows dynamic loading and execution of external Python policies without validation, posing a significant security risk if policies are untrusted. No malicious code is present in the code itself, but the mechanism can be exploited. The scores should reflect a malware risk around 0.6 and a security risk around 0.7, emphasizing the importance of trust and validation for external policies."
