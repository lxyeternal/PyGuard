  "purpose": "Manage splitting, dispatching, execution, and optional merging of quantum jobs with dynamic policies loaded from external Python files.",
  "sources": "Reading policy files from disk, importing modules via importlib.util.spec_from_file_location, executing modules with spec.loader.exec_module, copying files into policies folder.",
  "sinks": "Execution of imported modules, copying files into policies directory, potential execution of malicious code if files are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> importing modules -> executing modules -> copying files into policies folder.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import and execution of external Python files without validation or sandboxing, copying arbitrary files into policies directory after execution.",
  "analysis": "The code loads external Python scripts dynamically using importlib, executing their code without validation, which can run malicious payloads if files are untrusted. The copying of files into the policies folder after execution can propagate malicious code. No sandboxing or integrity checks are present. While no malicious activity is observed, the mechanism itself presents a significant security vector. The scores assigned in the reports (mostly low or zero malware, moderate risk) are somewhat conservative; a higher malware score (~0.6) is justified due to the potential for executing untrusted code. The obfuscated score is correctly zero. The overall security risk should be higher (~0.7) to reflect the inherent danger of dynamic code execution from untrusted sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code allows dynamic loading and execution of external Python policies without validation, posing a significant security risk if policies are untrusted. No malicious code is present in the code itself, but the mechanism can be exploited. The scores should reflect a malware risk around 0.6 and a security risk around 0.7, emphasizing the importance of trust and validation for external policies.",
