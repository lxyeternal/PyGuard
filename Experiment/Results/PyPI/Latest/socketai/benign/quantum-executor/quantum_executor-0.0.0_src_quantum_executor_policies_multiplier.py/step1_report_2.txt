{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to distribute quantum circuit jobs across multiple backends with a uniform policy.",
  "sources": "The function reads input parameters: 'circuit', 'shots', and 'backends'.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'dispatch.add_job', which adds jobs to an internal dispatch queue; no external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the loop to generate jobs; no external data flows or outputs other than job registration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Usage of 'circuit.copy()' is normal for avoiding mutation. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The function systematically adds jobs for each backend, using provided circuit copies and shot counts. The import statements are standard, and the 'Dispatch' class is used as intended. No signs of malicious actions such as data exfiltration, code injection, or external network calls are present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a uniform distribution policy for quantum jobs.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, transparent task of job distribution without any malicious intent. No malicious or security-risk behaviors are evident.",
