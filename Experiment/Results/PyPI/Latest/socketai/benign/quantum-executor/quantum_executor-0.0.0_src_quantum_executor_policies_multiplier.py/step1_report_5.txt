{
  "purpose": "Assigns the same quantum circuit and shot count to multiple backends and schedules jobs for execution.",
  "sources": "The function reads input parameters 'circuit', 'shots', 'backends', and '_virtual_provider'.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with the Dispatch object via add_job, which manages job scheduling; no external untrusted data sink is evident.",
  "flows": "Inputs ('circuit', 'shots', 'backends') flow into dispatch.add_job for each backend; no external data flow to sensitive sinks or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. Usage of 'circuit.copy()' appears standard. No obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Dispatch object and populates it with jobs for each backend specified. It iterates over the 'backends' dictionary, creating a job per backend with the provided circuit and shot count. There are no network connections, data leaks, or suspicious code behaviors. The parameters are used straightforwardly, and no dynamic execution or obfuscated logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, straightforward scheduling function for quantum jobs. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply schedules identical jobs across specified backends.",
