{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to distribute quantum circuit jobs across multiple backends with uniform parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters: 'circuit', 'shots', 'backends', '_virtual_provider', and 'policy_data'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data leading to data leaks or security effects are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into dispatch.add_job calls, with 'circuit' being copied and 'shots' used directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports relevant modules and defines a function 'split' that schedules jobs across backends. It does not process untrusted data beyond basic parameter passing. The 'circuit' is copied to prevent side effects, and each job is added to the 'Dispatch' object. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears straightforward, intended for parallel job dispatch, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation for dispatching quantum jobs to multiple backends. It shows no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities.",
