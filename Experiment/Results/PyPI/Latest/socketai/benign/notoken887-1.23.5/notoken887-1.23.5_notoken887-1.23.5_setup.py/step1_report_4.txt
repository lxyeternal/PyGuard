  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() function such as package name, author info, description, URL, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no code execution or data leakage points detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static inputs into the setup() function; no external data or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of suspicious URL (https://thugging.org) and a provocative email address ('hitler@gmail.com') suggesting potential malicious intent or social engineering; otherwise, no unusual code patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script defining package metadata. No dynamic code execution, no input/output handling, and no obfuscated or malicious code present. The URL and email appear intentionally provocative but do not constitute code-based malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with some potentially provocative metadata. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within the code itself.",
