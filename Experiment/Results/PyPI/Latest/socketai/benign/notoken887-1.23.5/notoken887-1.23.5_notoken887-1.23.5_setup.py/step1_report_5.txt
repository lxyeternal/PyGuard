  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'notoken887', including package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "User-provided setup() call with package metadata fields such as name, version, author, description, and URL.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not process untrusted input or data that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "N/A; static setup configuration with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of suspicious email address 'hitler@gmail.com' which may be considered inappropriate or malicious in context, but not technically malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata. No code execution, input handling, or external data processing occurs. The email address used is unusual and potentially malicious in intent, but the script itself contains no malicious code or behaviors. No signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious payloads are present. The package appears to be a simple configuration with no malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration with no malicious behavior or security risks. The only notable aspect is the suspicious email address, which could raise concerns about the package author's intent or reputation, but does not constitute malicious code.",
