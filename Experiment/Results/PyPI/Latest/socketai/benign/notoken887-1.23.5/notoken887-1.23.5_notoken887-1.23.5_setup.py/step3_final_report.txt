  "purpose": "Define package metadata for 'notoken887' using setuptools in a standard setup script.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields: name, version, packages, author, author_email, description, long_description, url, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static data assignment without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org') in metadata; no code obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with static metadata. No dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected. The metadata contains provocative contact info, which could be social engineering or reputation concerns but does not indicate malicious intent or code-based sabotage. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.15), reflecting metadata concerns but no technical vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code is benign and standard. The only issues are provocative metadata, which do not constitute malicious code or obfuscation. Scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are absent, and the security risk is minimal. No technical security threats are present.",
