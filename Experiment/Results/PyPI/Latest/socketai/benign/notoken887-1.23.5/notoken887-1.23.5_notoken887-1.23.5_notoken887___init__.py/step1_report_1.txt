  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly clear due to lack of comments and context; it appears to be a utility or setup script.",
  "sources": "Data sources include imported modules and any user input or environment variables, but none are explicitly read from input or external sources in the visible code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file writes, or system commands, but none are evident in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No clear data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is observable in the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual language features are evident. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python import statements and possibly configuration or setup logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments are present. The absence of external data handling or suspicious operations suggests low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and straightforward, with no indications of malware or security threats.",
