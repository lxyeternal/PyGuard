  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a basic utility for handling data, possibly involving input processing and output generation. No explicit purpose is provided within the code snippet itself.",
  "sources": "Input sources include data received from user input functions or external data files, such as 'input()' calls or file reads.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output functions like 'print()', network transmission functions, or writing to files. However, specific sink functions are not clearly identified in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the sources (user input or external data) to processing logic, then potentially to sinks such as output functions or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "There are no apparent anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code constructs. The code appears straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple, performing standard data processing tasks without complex logic. No signs of malicious behavior like data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are observed. Usage of third-party libraries, if any, is not inherently suspicious. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or system modifications are present. The code structure and content do not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script with standard functionality. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is very low.",
