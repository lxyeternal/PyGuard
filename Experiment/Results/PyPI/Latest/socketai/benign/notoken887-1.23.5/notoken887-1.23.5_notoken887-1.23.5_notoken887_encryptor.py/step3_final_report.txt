  "purpose": "Provides reversible substitution cipher for simple obfuscation of text data.",
  "sources": "Input string in encrypt() and encrypted_token in decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data flows, network calls, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace() chain in encrypt(); encrypted_token -> replace() chain in decrypt().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static substitution cipher with hardcoded mappings.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a deterministic, static substitution cipher with fixed mappings for each character. It performs character replacements in both encryption and decryption, serving solely as an obfuscation utility. No external dependencies, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The cipher is insecure for cryptographic purposes but does not contain malicious behavior or backdoors. The code's simplicity and transparency mean it is not obfuscated beyond basic substitution. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is detected. The security risk score is very low (around 0.1), reflecting the weakness of the cipher rather than malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward and not intentionally hidden or complex. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9 to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, deterministic substitution cipher used for obfuscation, with no malicious features or malicious intent. It does not perform any harmful operations or external communications. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its benign nature. The primary concern is its insecurity for protecting sensitive data, but this does not constitute malicious behavior.",
