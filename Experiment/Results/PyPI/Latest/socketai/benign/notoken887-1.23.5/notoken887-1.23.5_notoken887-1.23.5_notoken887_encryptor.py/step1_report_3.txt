{
  "purpose": "The class TokenCryptor provides simple substitution cipher functionality to encode and decode strings using a set of Unicode characters as symbols.",
  "sources": "Input data is received via the encrypt() method's 'string' parameter and the decrypt() method's 'encrypted_token' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any external data transmission, file operations, or system modifications; it only processes and returns transformed string data.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed into symbols in encrypt(), and those symbols are transformed back into characters in decrypt(), following a direct substitution flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs straightforward character replacement without any obfuscation, external calls, or hidden behavior. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a basic substitution cipher with predefined mappings between alphanumeric characters and Unicode symbols. Both encrypt() and decrypt() methods perform complementary replace() chains that map characters to symbols and vice versa. There are no external dependencies, data leaks, or malicious code such as network communication, file modification, or code execution. The logic is simple, deterministic, and limited to character substitution, which is inherently insecure but not malicious. No signs of obfuscation or malware behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs simple encoding and decoding via character substitution with Unicode symbols. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a non-secure, obfuscation-like encoding mechanism rather than malicious code, with no external or harmful effects.",
