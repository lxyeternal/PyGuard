{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple character substitution cipher to encode and decode strings, possibly for obfuscation or basic encoding purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings for encryption and decryption through method parameters 'string' and 'encrypted_token'.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs transformed strings, but does not write to files, network, or external systems; no immediate sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed to 'encrypt' or 'decrypt', which then perform chained replacements to convert characters to symbols and vice versa, returning the transformed strings.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs extensive character replacements without any validation, cryptographic security, or handling of edge cases. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. The class's sole function is simple substitution cipher, which is inherently insecure but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The class 'TokenCryptor' implements a basic substitution cipher by replacing characters with symbols in 'encrypt' and reversing this process in 'decrypt'. The replacement mappings are extensive but straightforward. No external data sources, network activity, or system modifications are present. The code does not perform any malicious operations such as data exfiltration, command execution, or system manipulation. The only concern is the use of a weak, easily reversible cipher, but that is a security weakness rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple substitution cipher for encoding and decoding text, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors. It appears to be for obfuscation purposes only, not malicious activity. No security risks or malware are detected.",
