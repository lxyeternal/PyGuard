{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods to encode (encrypt) and decode (decrypt) strings by replacing characters with symbols and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to encrypt() and encrypted tokens fed into decrypt().",
  "sinks": "Return statements outputting the transformed strings; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed character-by-character through string replacement, with no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code solely performs character replacements without external dependencies, data leaks, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two methods: encrypt and decrypt, both performing straightforward character substitutions. The mappings are static, hardcoded, and reversible, serving as a simple encoding scheme. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network communication, code injection, or backdoors. The structure and logic are simple, transparent, and focused on character replacement. No external dependencies or runtime environment manipulations are evident. Overall, the code appears to serve as a simple cipher or obfuscation utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a basic character substitution cipher with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations, data leaks, or external communications. It is a straightforward implementation of reversible character mapping for obfuscation purposes.",
