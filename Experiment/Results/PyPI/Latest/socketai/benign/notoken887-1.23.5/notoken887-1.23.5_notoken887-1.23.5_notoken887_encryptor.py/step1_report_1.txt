{
  "purpose": "The class TokenCryptor provides simple substitution-based encryption and decryption methods for obfuscating text strings.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided to the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods as the parameter 'string' and 'encrypted_token'.",
  "sinks": "The functions perform string replacements; no external data sinks or network calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed via character replacements in 'encrypt' and reverse in 'decrypt'. No external flows or untrusted data influence system state.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses straightforward, reversible character substitution. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation beyond simple replacement logic. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a basic substitution cipher with character mappings for encryption and decryption. The replacement pairs are fixed and deterministic, serving only as an obfuscation layer, not security. There are no input/output vulnerabilities, no external data dependencies, and no suspicious code patterns. The methods are self-contained, with no malicious behavior or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple substitution cipher utility with no malicious or security-compromising features. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. It appears to serve only as an obfuscation tool without malicious intent.",
