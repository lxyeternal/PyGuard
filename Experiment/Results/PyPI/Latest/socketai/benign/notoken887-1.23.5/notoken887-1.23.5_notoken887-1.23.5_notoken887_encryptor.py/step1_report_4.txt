{
  "purpose": "The class provides a simple substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings, likely for obfuscation or basic privacy purposes.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to the encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "Output of the encrypt and decrypt methods; potential for misuse if integrated with other code that handles sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Input string → encrypt method (replaces characters with symbols) → output encrypted token. Encrypted token → decrypt method (replaces symbols with characters) → output original string.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs only straightforward character replacements with no external data access, network calls, or environment variable usage. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The mapping appears purely for encoding/decoding, with no side effects or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a static substitution cipher for alphabetic characters and digits, replacing each with a specific Unicode symbol in 'encrypt' and reversing the process in 'decrypt'. The approach is purely deterministic and does not involve external inputs beyond the method arguments. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoor mechanisms. The code is simple and straightforward, focusing solely on character substitution. No obfuscation or complex logic that could hide malicious intent is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. Its simplicity and lack of external dependencies or network activity suggest it is unlikely to be used maliciously. Overall, the code appears safe and non-malicious.",
