{
  "purpose": "Provides decorators for CUDA operations, device selection, tensorization, and resource management in ML workflows.",
  "sources": "System commands ('nvidia-smi -pm 1'), torch.cuda, psutil, checkpoint saving during exceptions, tensor and device operations.",
  "sinks": "Device selection, tensor movement, checkpoint files, system power management commands, function execution.",
  "flows": "Input data (tensors, models) -> device selection -> tensorization -> resource commands -> function execution -> checkpoint saving.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'nvidia-smi -pm 1' for persistence mode, saving checkpoints during exceptions, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code manages CUDA devices, tensor operations, and resource settings with standard practices. No malicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. Use of system commands for power management and checkpointing are typical in GPU workflows. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected. The resource management commands could be misused but are legitimate in context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for CUDA resource and device management, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified due to system commands but does not indicate malicious activity.",
