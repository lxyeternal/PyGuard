{
  "purpose": "To provide easy device management and decorators for PyTorch, TensorFlow, and CuPy in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports from .decorators and .context modules within the package",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities",
  "flows": "Imports functions and assigns an alias; no data flow from untrusted sources is present",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific decorators and a context manager from internal modules, then assigns an alias to simplify usage. It defines __all__ to specify exported symbols. The code is straightforward and primarily involves module organization without any data processing, input handling, or external communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation in this minimal initialization code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package initialization, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply re-exports components for external use.",
