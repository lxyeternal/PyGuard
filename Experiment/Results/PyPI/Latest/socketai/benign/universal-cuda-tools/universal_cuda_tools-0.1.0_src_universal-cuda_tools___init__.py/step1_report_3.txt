  "purpose": "To provide easy device management utilities for deep learning frameworks and mathematical operations in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .decorators and .context",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flows to external systems or sensitive areas",
  "flows": "Imports from local modules are assigned to variables and exposed via __all__, with no external data flow or untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes from local modules, assigns an alias to one of the imported functions, and defines the __all__ list for module exports. The purpose is to facilitate device management for ML frameworks, with no evidence of malicious behavior or suspicious patterns. No data input, external connections, or obfuscation are present. The structure is simple and standard for an __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a straightforward module initializer for device management utilities. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no security risks.",
