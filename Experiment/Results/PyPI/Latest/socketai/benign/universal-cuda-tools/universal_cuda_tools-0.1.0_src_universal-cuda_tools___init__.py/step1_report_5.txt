{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and exports decorators and a context manager for device management in machine learning frameworks, specifically PyTorch and TensorFlow, using CuPy.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .decorators and .context",
  "sinks": "None present; the code only imports and assigns attributes without processing untrusted input",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; simple attribute assignment and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns observed. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of module docstring documentation, import statements, attribute assignment, and export list definition. It is straightforward, with no dynamic code, network activity, or credential handling. It primarily serves as an API surface for device management decorators and context managers, with no indication of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module initializer that exports device management utilities for machine learning frameworks. No malicious intent or security risks are evident based on this code alone.",
