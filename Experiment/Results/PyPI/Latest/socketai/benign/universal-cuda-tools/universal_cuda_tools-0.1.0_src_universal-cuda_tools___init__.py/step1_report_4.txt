{
  "purpose": "This code initializes the 'universal-cuda_tools' package, importing and exposing CUDA-related decorators and a device context manager for device management in machine learning frameworks.",
  "sources": "The code sources its components from local modules: 'decorators' and 'context' within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, user input, or external data sources are present; the code primarily imports and assigns attributes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only assigns imported functions to attributes and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code structure is straightforward, serving as an initializer for package exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes from local modules and sets up an alias for convenience. It assigns 'cuda.advanced' to 'cuda_advanced' and defines the public API with '__all__'. No user input, network operations, or data processing occurs here. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior; it solely manages package exports and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It simply exposes utility functions and classes for device management in machine learning workflows.",
