{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer for 'universal-cuda_tools', exposing device management utilities for ML frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.decorators and .context), assignment of cuda.advanced, and definition of __all__.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Importing functions/classes from internal modules, assigning an alias, and exposing them via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py that manages imports and API exposure. It contains no data handling, network activity, or dynamic execution. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with its benign, utility nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple package initializer. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No security risks or malicious intent are evident.",
