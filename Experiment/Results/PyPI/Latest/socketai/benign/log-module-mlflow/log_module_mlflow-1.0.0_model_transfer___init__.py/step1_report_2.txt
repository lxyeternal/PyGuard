  "purpose": "Importing the function 'log_to_mlflow' from the local module 'log_module_mlflow'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'log_module_mlflow' module from the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs within this snippet; the function is only imported.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or output handling is present in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and appears to be a standard import statement; no anomalies or suspicious activity are evident.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward import statement importing a function named 'log_to_mlflow' from a local module. It does not perform any actions, data processing, or communication. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. Since this is only an import, it’s unlikely to be malicious by itself. No obfuscation or malicious intent is detectable from this line alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a part of a larger project that uses MLflow for logging. No suspicious activity detected.",
