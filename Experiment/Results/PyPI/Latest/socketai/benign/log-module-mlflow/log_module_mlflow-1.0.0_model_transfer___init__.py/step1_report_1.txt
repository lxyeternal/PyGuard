{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'log_to_mlflow' from a local module 'log_module_mlflow', likely used for logging data or metrics to MLflow.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing 'log_to_mlflow' from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; no untrusted data processing or output in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A – only import statement, no data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation present in this simple import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement that references a local module, 'log_module_mlflow', and a function within it. There is no execution of untrusted input, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded secrets or credentials. The structure appears typical for modular Python code that utilizes MLflow for experiment tracking.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It is a standard import statement intended to include logging functionality from a local module.",
