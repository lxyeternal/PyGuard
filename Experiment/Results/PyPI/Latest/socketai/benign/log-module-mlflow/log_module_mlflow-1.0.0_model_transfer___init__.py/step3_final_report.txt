  "purpose": "Import a logging function from a local module for MLflow integration.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .log_module_mlflow import log_to_mlflow",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only imports a function, no data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the import does not execute or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import statement with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import of a function from a local module, with no execution, data flow, or network activity. No obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are evident. The import alone cannot be malicious, and the code is clear and standard. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this snippet, assigning low or zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. Given the context, the code poses no threat.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
