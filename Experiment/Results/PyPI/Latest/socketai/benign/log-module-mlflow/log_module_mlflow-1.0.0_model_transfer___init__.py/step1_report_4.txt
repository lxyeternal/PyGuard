{
  "purpose": "Importing a function named log_to_mlflow from a local module log_module_mlflow, likely for logging data to MLflow.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the local module log_module_mlflow.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform external actions are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable beyond the import statement; no source-to-sink flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a function from a local module, which is common in Python projects. It does not execute any code, perform any data processing, or interact with external systems directly. Since the import is from a local module, no external network activity or malicious behavior can be inferred from this fragment alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, performing a simple import of a logging function from a local module. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies present in this minimal code.",
