{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'log_to_mlflow' from a local module 'log_module_mlflow'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module within the package",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the 'log_to_mlflow' function could perform external logging or network communication when called, but this code only imports the function, not its execution.",
  "flows": "No execution or data flow occurs in this snippet; only an import statement is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function from a local module, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. Since no execution or additional context is provided, it is not possible to determine if the imported function performs malicious actions. The import itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger module intended for logging to MLflow.",
