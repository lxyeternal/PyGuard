  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python module named 'log_module_mlflow' to upload to PyPI.",
  "sources": "Input data from setup() parameters such as name, version, packages, description, author, author_email, classifiers, and python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or points where data could leak or be exploited; no network or system calls, no external data handling.",
  "flows": "The code initializes package configuration data, which is static and does not involve data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected. Usage of standard setup tools without dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools to define package metadata and configuration. It specifies package details such as name, version, packages, description, author info, classifiers, and required Python version. All elements are static and standard for Python packaging. No suspicious or malicious code, no dynamic execution, and no external data interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical and benign setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is standard boilerplate code for packaging purposes.",
