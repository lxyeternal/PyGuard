  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata for a Python package using setuptools, including name, version, description, author info, classifiers, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata fields and calls find_packages() for package inclusion.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no sinks capable of data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "N/A; static metadata declaration without data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and standard for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple setup script with no dynamic code, external data handling, network calls, or suspicious patterns. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The code's static and well-known structure indicates no malicious intent or obfuscation. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports are accurate, and the current scores are appropriate.",
