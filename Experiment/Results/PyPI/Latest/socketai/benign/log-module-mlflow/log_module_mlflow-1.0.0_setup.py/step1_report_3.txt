  "purpose": "To configure and package a Python module named 'log_module_mlflow' for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "N/A (No input or data reading sources; standard setup parameters)",
  "sinks": "N/A (No untrusted data handling or output to external systems; only package metadata and configuration)",
  "flows": "N/A (No data flows from sources to sinks, as this is a standard setup script)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setuptools setup script with typical parameters. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, defines a setup configuration with package metadata such as name, version, description, author, and classifiers. It uses find_packages() to include all sub-packages. The script is a typical setup.py for Python packaging, with no dynamic code, no external data sources, no network activity, or suspicious logic. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious or security-risk behavior detected.",
