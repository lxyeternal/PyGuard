{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to validate inputs and log parameters, metrics, and artifacts to an MLflow experiment tracking server.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (`experiment_name`, `params_map`, `metrics_map`, `artifact_paths`), environment variable `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI`, and file system for artifact paths.",
  "sinks": "MLflow API functions (`mlflow.set_tracking_uri`, `mlflow.set_experiment`, `mlflow.start_run`, `mlflow.log_param`, `mlflow.log_metric`, `mlflow.log_artifact`) that send data to the MLflow server, which could potentially be malicious if compromised.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and environment variable flow into validation and configuration steps, then data flows into MLflow logging functions, with potential file system access for artifacts.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior detected. The code uses standard logging, environment variables, and file system access. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. Artifact logging handles directories and individual files properly.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs input validation, environment configuration, and data logging to MLflow, a standard ML tracking tool. It accesses environment variables and the file system, which are normal in such workflows. No suspicious patterns, hidden behaviors, or malicious code segments are identified. The error handling and logging are straightforward, with no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate MLflow utility script with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It follows common practices for input validation, logging, and artifact handling. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on the provided code.",
