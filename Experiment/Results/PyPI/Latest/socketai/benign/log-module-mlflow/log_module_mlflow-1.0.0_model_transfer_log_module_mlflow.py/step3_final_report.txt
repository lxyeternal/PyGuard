  "purpose": "A utility script for validating inputs and logging parameters, metrics, and artifacts to MLflow during machine learning experiments.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI', input parameters 'experiment_name', 'params_map', 'metrics_map', 'artifact_paths', filesystem checks for artifact existence.",
  "sinks": "MLflow API calls for logging parameters, metrics, artifacts; environment variable access; filesystem reads for artifacts.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated, environment variable 'MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI' is retrieved, then MLflow tracking URI and experiment are set, followed by logging parameters, metrics, and artifacts if they exist.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward with standard practices; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation, retrieves the tracking URI from environment variables, sets up MLflow experiment, and logs parameters, metrics, and artifacts. Artifact handling correctly distinguishes between files and directories. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. Error handling is via logging. The code is a typical MLflow utility with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard MLflow logging utility with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to environment variable reliance and filesystem interactions, which are common in such scripts. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting very low operational risk.",
