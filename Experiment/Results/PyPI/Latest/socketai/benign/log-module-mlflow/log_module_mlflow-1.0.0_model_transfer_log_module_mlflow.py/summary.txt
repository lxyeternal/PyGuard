  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard MLflow logging utility with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to environment variable reliance and filesystem interactions, which are common in such scripts. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting very low operational risk."
