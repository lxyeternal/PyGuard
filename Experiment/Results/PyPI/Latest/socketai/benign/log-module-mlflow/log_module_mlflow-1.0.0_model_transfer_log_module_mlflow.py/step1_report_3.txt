{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to validate inputs and log parameters, metrics, and artifacts to an MLflow experiment for machine learning model tracking.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI' for MLflow tracking URI; function arguments 'experiment_name', 'params_map', 'metrics_map', 'artifact_paths'; file system for artifact existence checks and logging artifacts.",
  "sinks": "Logging to console and system logs; MLflow API calls which could log parameters, metrics, or artifacts; potential reading of environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI' -> mlflow.set_tracking_uri -> mlflow.set_experiment -> mlflow.start_run -> mlflow.log_param / log_metric / log_artifact",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior detected. Standard logging, environment variable access, and MLflow API usage are normal. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs input validation, environment variable access, and uses MLflow APIs to log data. It includes file system checks before artifact logging. No malicious logic or backdoors are present. All data handling appears legitimate and consistent with typical MLflow usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard MLflow logging utility with input validation and artifact handling. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or suspicious anomalies are detected. The code appears safe and intended for legitimate ML experiment tracking.",
