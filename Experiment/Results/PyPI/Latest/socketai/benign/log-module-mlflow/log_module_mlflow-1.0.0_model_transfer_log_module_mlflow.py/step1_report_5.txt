  "purpose": "The code is designed to validate inputs and log parameters, metrics, and artifacts to an MLflow experiment for machine learning experiment tracking.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the function 'log_to_mlflow' (experiment_name, params_map, metrics_map, artifact_paths); Environment variable 'MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI'; File system via os.path.exists and os.walk.",
  "sinks": "MLflow logging functions (log_param, log_metric, log_artifact); Environment variable usage for tracking URI.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI' -> mlflow.set_tracking_uri -> mlflow.set_experiment -> mlflow.start_run -> logging of params, metrics, artifacts.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials; no obfuscated code; standard usage of environment variables and logging.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation of input parameters, retrieves tracking URI from environment variables, and logs ML experiment data using MLflow APIs. It includes routine logging and artifact handling, with no signs of malicious behavior. No external network communication beyond MLflow's normal operations is present. The use of environment variables is typical for configuration. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. The code appears to be a straightforward ML experiment logging utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of MLflow logging with input validation and artifact handling. It contains no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe for use in legitimate machine learning workflows.",
