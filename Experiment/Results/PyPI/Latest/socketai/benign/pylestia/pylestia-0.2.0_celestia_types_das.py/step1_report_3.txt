  "purpose": "Define data structures for tracking sampling and worker statistics in a system, with methods for initialization and deserialization.",
  "sources": "Input data for SamplingStats.deserializer method, and constructor parameters for SamplingStats and Worker classes.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the constructor of SamplingStats, which processes 'workers' data into Worker objects. Deserializer processes external result data into a SamplingStats instance.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code is straightforward data class definitions and initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two dataclasses, Worker and SamplingStats, for managing system statistics. SamplingStats constructor converts a list of dicts into Worker objects. The deserializer method creates an instance from external data. No external input is processed directly; all data handling appears controlled. No network, file, or environment variable operations are present, and no code injection or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard data container classes with straightforward initialization and deserialization. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
