{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for sampling statistics and worker information, with methods for initialization and deserialization.",
  "sources": "Data passed into the constructor via parameters, especially 'workers' and 'result' in deserializer.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data into sensitive operations or outputs.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into class constructors and deserializer method, with no further data handling or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The use of dynamic tuple creation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides dataclass definitions for 'Worker' and 'SamplingStats', with an explicit constructor initializing attributes and converting a list of dictionaries into 'Worker' instances. The static method 'deserializer' reconstructs a 'SamplingStats' object from a dictionary. There are no external network calls, eval, exec, or obfuscated code. No hardcoded credentials, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic are present. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward data structure implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data container implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any network activity, data leakage, or system manipulation. The design is standard for data modeling purposes.",
