  "purpose": "Defines data classes for system sampling statistics and workers, with deserialization from dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Input dictionaries passed to the deserializer and constructor for data initialization.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input dictionaries -> Worker instances -> SamplingStats object; deserializer reconstructs object from dict.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward data modeling with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two data classes with standard initialization and deserialization methods. It converts a list of worker dicts into Worker objects and constructs SamplingStats instances from dictionaries. No external data sources, network calls, code execution, or obfuscation are present. The logic is simple and safe, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data container with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
