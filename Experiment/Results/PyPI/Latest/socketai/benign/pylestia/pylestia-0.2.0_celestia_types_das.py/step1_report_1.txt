  "purpose": "Define data structures for sampling statistics and workers, including initialization and deserialization methods.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'workers' in __init__ and 'result' in deserializer method.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct data leaks or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to class attributes; deserialization flows from result dict to SamplingStats instance.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward with standard data class usage and explicit attribute handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two data classes, Worker and SamplingStats, for representing sampling process data. The __init__ method in SamplingStats converts a list of worker dicts into Worker objects, which is standard practice. The deserializer method creates an instance from a dictionary if provided. There are no external data sources, no network operations, no dynamic code execution, or other suspicious behaviors. The code is purely for data modeling without any apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical data model implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs data encapsulation and deserialization in a straightforward manner without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
