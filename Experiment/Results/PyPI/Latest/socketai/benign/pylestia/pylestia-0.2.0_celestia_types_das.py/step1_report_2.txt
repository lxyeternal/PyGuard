  "purpose": "Define data structures for sampling statistics and workers, with a deserialization method.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and a static method; no external data input points.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is directly sent or executed.",
  "flows": "The deserializer method creates an instance from a result object, but there are no data flows involving external inputs in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The use of tuple[Worker, ...] suggests compatibility with modern Python, but nothing suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two dataclasses: Worker and SamplingStats. SamplingStats includes an __init__ method for initializing attributes and converting a list of dicts into Worker instances. The static method deserializer creates a SamplingStats object from a result dict if provided. No external data sources, network calls, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be straightforward data structure definitions with standard initialization and deserialization logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign; it solely defines data containers with standard methods. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is present.",
