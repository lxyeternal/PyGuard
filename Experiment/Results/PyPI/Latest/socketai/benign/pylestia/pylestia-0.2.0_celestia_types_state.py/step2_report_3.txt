  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a set of data classes with deserialization methods for blockchain data. No external calls, no malicious patterns, straightforward data modeling.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - The code reads data from dictionaries into objects; no external system interaction or code execution is evident.  \n  - No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent.  \n  - The deserializer methods assume well-formed input but do not perform validation, which is typical for such models.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct, no malicious code)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)  \n  - Security Risk: 0 (benign data models)  \n\n- **Conclusion:** The score aligns with the code's nature. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, defining data classes for blockchain responses, with deserialization methods, no external calls.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - Same reasoning applies: no external system interaction, no malicious code, no obfuscation.  \n  - The code is standard data handling.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.1 (slightly above zero, possibly due to general caution but justified as no actual risk).\n\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines data classes for blockchain data, deserialization, no external or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - No suspicious patterns, no external commands, network calls, or data leaks.  \n  - Import of a local module (`celestia._celestia.types`) is noted but not suspicious without further context.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.1 (standard cautious default)\n\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard data models for blockchain responses, straightforward deserialization.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - No malicious code, no external system calls, no obfuscation.  \n  - Data flows only into internal objects from dictionaries.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0\n\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, data classes with deserialization, no external interactions.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external system interaction.  \n  - Standard data handling code.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.1 (consistent with cautious default)\n\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code. I agree with the 0 scores across all reports.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports are clear, straightforward code. 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given that these are purely data models with deserialization from external data, the risk is minimal. The 0.1 default is reasonable, indicating a very low risk, which I concur with.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- **Potential concerns:**  \n  - The deserialization methods do not perform validation or sanitization, which could be a concern if malicious data is fed into these classes elsewhere in the system. However, within this code snippet, no actual security vulnerability exists.\n\n- **No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present.**\n\n---\n\n### **My final estimates:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (standard low risk for data models handling external data)\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's nature.",
