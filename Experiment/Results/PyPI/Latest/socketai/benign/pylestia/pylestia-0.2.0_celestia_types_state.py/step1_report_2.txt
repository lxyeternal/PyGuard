{
  "purpose": "Defines data classes for handling blockchain transaction and delegation responses, including serialization and deserialization methods.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class constructors, static deserializer methods, attribute initializations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; deserializer methods process input dictionaries into class instances.",
  "flows": "Input dictionaries flow into deserializer methods, which instantiate data classes; no other data flow or external communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious logic present. All code performs straightforward data parsing and object creation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data class definitions for blockchain-related entities such as balances, transactions, delegations, redelegations, unbondings, and pagination. Each class includes constructors and static deserializer methods that convert dictionaries into class instances. There are no network operations, external command executions, or handling of untrusted input beyond dictionary-to-object transformation. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for data handling with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data modeling layer for a blockchain SDK or API client. It does not contain any malicious code or behavior. No security risks are apparent from the provided code snippet.",
