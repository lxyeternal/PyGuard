  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and contains no malicious or obfuscated patterns. The scores in the reports are mostly accurate, except for the overly high security risk in Report 1, which should be adjusted to zero. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is safe for deployment."
