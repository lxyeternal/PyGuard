  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its purpose, data flow, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines data structures and deserialization methods for blockchain data. No external system interactions, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is straightforward data modeling with no malicious behavior. The deserialization functions simply convert dictionaries into class instances.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The code appears safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code handles blockchain responses with no external calls or malicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is standard data classes with deserialization, no external or unsafe operations.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, security risk very low, consistent with the code.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard data classes for blockchain data, no suspicious logic.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No signs of malicious activity, no external system interactions.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk scores are 0 and 0.1 respectively, which are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Data models for blockchain delegation, redelegation, unbonding, deserialization, with no malicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with safe deserialization methods and no external calls.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, security risk low, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard data structures for blockchain responses.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk scores are consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that the code is purely data modeling and deserialization.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None apparent. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores consistency:** All are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Malware and obfuscated scores:** Correctly at 0, as no malicious code or obfuscation is present.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is straightforward.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, standard data handling; no security risk in isolation)\n\n**Note:** The code is a standard data layer for blockchain responses, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, well-structured, and appropriate for its purpose. No changes to scores are necessary.",
