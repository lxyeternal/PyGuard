{
  "purpose": "Define data models for blockchain delegation, redelegation, unbonding, and transaction responses, with methods for deserialization.",
  "sources": "Imports modules; data classes initialize with parameters; static deserializer methods read from dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions are present.",
  "flows": "Deserializers convert dictionaries to class instances; constructors initialize attributes from inputs; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Code uses standard data class patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines structured data models with straightforward initialization and deserialization methods. There is no evidence of code injection, malicious logic, or data exfiltration. No external network calls, system modifications, or sensitive data handling are present. The implementation appears to be standard for handling blockchain response data. Deserialization methods safely convert dictionaries to objects, and data attributes are simple data types. No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard data model definitions for blockchain transaction and delegation responses, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is safe and intended for data handling within a larger application context.",
