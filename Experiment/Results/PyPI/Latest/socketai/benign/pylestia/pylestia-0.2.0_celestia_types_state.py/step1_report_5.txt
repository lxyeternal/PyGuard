{
  "purpose": "The code defines data structures for handling blockchain transaction responses and delegation states, providing methods for deserialization from dictionary representations.",
  "sources": "Data inputs from external sources such as blockchain APIs or user input that provide dictionaries to deserializer methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include deserialization methods that convert external data into class instances; however, no unsafe or external system calls, network operations, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external sources into deserializer functions, which instantiate objects from dictionaries. These objects are used within the application but no further propagation is visible in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard deserialization and data encapsulation without any unusual language features, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data class definitions for blockchain response data, with constructors and static methods to deserialize from dictionaries. There are no external system calls, network communications, or data leaks. Usage of standard Python features and straightforward object creation indicates normal behavior. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical implementation of data structures and deserialization methods for blockchain transaction responses and delegation data. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behaviors.",
