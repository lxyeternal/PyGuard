{
  "purpose": "The code defines data structures and deserialization methods for blockchain data, including balances, transaction responses, delegations, redelegations, unbondings, and pagination.",
  "sources": "The deserialization methods read data from external dictionaries (likely JSON or API responses).",
  "sinks": "Data is converted into internal class instances; no external outputs or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "External data flows into class constructors via deserialization functions, with no external system interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data classes with constructors and static deserialization methods. There are no network calls, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. The deserialization assumes well-formed input but does not perform validation, which is typical for such models. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The high security risk score in Report 1 (0.9) is unjustified and should be lowered to 0. The overall code is safe and suitable for use as a data layer for blockchain responses.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and contains no malicious or obfuscated patterns. The scores in the reports are mostly accurate, except for the overly high security risk in Report 1, which should be adjusted to zero. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is safe for deployment.",
