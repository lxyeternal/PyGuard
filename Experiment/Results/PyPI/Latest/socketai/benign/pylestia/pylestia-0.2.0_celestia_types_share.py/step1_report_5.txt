  "purpose": "Define data structures for handling proofs, shares, and related entities in a blockchain or data availability context.",
  "sources": "Input data includes dictionaries, lists, and tuples used in constructors and deserializers for object instantiation.",
  "targets": "Data attributes and constructor methods that process and instantiate objects from input data.",
  "flows": "Input data (dicts, lists) -> constructors/deserializers -> object attributes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of deserialization methods is standard, no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data classes with straightforward constructors and static deserialization methods. It ensures type safety via type checks and conversions. There are no signs of malicious code such as network calls, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The constructors and deserializers handle data normalization and object creation, which is typical in such data handling modules. No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no obfuscated constructs, and no dynamic execution detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard data structure definitions used for blockchain proofs and shares. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. It is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
