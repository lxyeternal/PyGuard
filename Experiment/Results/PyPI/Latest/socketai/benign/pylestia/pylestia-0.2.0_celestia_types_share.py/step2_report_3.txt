  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code content, the logic, and the scoring justification.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily defining data classes for proofs, shares, ranges, and namespace data.\n- No external input is processed beyond constructors/deserializers.\n- No network, file, or system modification operations are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code behaviors are identified.\n- The code relies on external types (`celestia.types.*`) but uses them in a straightforward manner.\n- Deserialization methods are simple and do not perform any dangerous operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code is standard data model code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified as no malicious code or suspicious activity.\n- **Risk score:** 0, aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, high confidence in benign assessment.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Fully reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes straightforward data classes with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0, no malicious activity.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, perhaps slightly cautious but still very low, considering no external effects.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Again, confirms no malicious activity, straightforward data structures.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1, very low, appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion, no malicious behaviors.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1, very low.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code is standard data class definitions with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, very high.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Verdict:** Fully reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a set of data classes for cryptographic proofs, shares, and related structures.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign malware score 0, which is justified. No malicious activity or code behaviors are present.\n- **Obfuscation:** All agree on 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1 or 0.2) to reflect minimal concern, but overall, the code is benign.\n\n### **Potential Adjustments:**\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- The only area to consider is the **security risk score**—it's minimal, reflecting no active threats.\n- The **malware score** remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n\n| Metric            | Suggested Score | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                 | No malicious code, behaviors, or suspicious patterns.      |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                 | Clear, straightforward data class definitions.              |\n| Risk              | 0.0 – 0.2         | Very low, as the code is purely data modeling.             |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No changes needed. The code is safe, benign, and standard for data handling in cryptographic systems.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nI concur with the existing scores, and I would assign **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, and **security risk = 0** to reflect the benign nature of this code snippet.",
