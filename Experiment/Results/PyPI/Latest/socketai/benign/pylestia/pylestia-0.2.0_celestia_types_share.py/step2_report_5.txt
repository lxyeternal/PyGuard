  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of data classes with constructors and deserialization methods.\n- No external input processing beyond data initialization.\n- No network, file, or system modifications.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.\n- The code relies on external types (`celestia.types.*`) but these are not part of the provided code, so their security implications are outside our scope.\n- The purpose appears to be structured data handling for cryptographic proofs in a blockchain context.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is standard data models; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on straightforward data handling.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score, but no justification for any risk. The code is benign.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern, no suspicious activity.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate, given the benign nature.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard data classes with no malicious behavior.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—benign data structures.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned.\n\n---\n\n### Critical analysis:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports identify the code as benign data models. There are no actual vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as standard data handling with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate. Security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores?**  \n  None of the reports justify their security risk scores above 0.2, and given the code, even 0.2 seems high. I agree with the low scores.\n\n- **Malware scores:**  \n  Since no malicious activity or code is present, malware scores should remain at 0.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n  The reports avoid assumptions; they correctly identify the code as safe.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores for the entire code:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk:** **0.0 - 0.1** — Very low, as the code is purely data modeling.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a set of well-structured, standard data classes for cryptographic proof data in a blockchain context. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, and the scores should reflect that, with malware at 0 and very low security risk scores.",
