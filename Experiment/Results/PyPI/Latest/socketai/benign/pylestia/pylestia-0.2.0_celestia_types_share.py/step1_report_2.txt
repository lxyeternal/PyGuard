  "purpose": "Define data classes for handling proofs, shares, and related data structures used in Celestia's data availability and proof systems.",
  "sources": "None; the code mainly involves class definitions and initializations.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or external data handling shown.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to internal attribute assignments during object instantiation, but no external untrusted input flows are demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code performs standard data encapsulation with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple data classes for managing complex proof and data structures, with initialization methods and deserialization functions. All data processing appears to be straightforward, with conversions to tuples and calls to other data class constructors. No external network, file operations, or environment variable usage are present. The code does not perform any suspicious operations like data exfiltration, code injection, or system modification. Usage of class constructors and deserialization methods aligns with typical patterns for handling structured data. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malware are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data class definitions for managing proofs and data in the Celestia project. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger system for handling cryptographic proofs and data structures.",
