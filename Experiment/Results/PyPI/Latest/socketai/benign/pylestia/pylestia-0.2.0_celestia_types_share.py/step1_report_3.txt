{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for handling proofs, shares, ranges, and namespace data in the celestia module.",
  "sources": "The code primarily reads data from input parameters to constructors and static methods (e.g., dict inputs for deserialization). No external data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points of untrusted data flow leading to system effects are apparent; the code only constructs data objects from provided inputs.",
  "flows": "Input data (dicts, lists) flows into constructors and deserializers to create structured objects; no external or network outputs are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors, are present. The code appears straightforward and consistent with data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several dataclasses for representing proofs, shares, ranges, and namespace data, mainly for cryptographic or blockchain-related purposes. Constructors and static methods parse dictionaries into structured objects, ensuring type safety and data integrity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All data handling seems confined to safe, predictable object creation. Usage of external inputs is limited to initializing data objects; no dangerous operations are performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of data structures with no malicious intent. It solely facilitates data parsing and organization for the celestia module, with no evident security risks or malware indicators.",
