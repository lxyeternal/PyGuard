  "purpose": "Define data classes for handling proofs, shares, and related data structures in the celestia.types module.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__) for ShareProof, GetRangeResult, NamespaceData; deserializer static methods; data class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or eval/exec statements are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs into class constructors (__init__) and deserializer methods, but these are only data assignments and conversions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of data classes that structure and validate data for cryptographic proofs and shares. It includes straightforward constructors and static deserialization methods. No external input is processed directly beyond data initialization. There are no network operations, code injections, or data leaks. The design appears consistent with standard data handling for cryptographic proofs. Overall, the code is clean, and there are no suspicious behaviors or security risks observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of data models used for cryptographic proofs and proofs-related data, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. It is safe based on the provided code snippet.",
