{
  "purpose": "Define data classes for handling proofs, shares, and related data structures in a blockchain or data availability context.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading external input; the code primarily defines classes and methods for data handling and deserialization.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data to external systems, networks, or files.",
  "flows": "N/A; data flows are limited to in-memory deserialization and object instantiation within class methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The class methods perform standard data structure manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several dataclasses for structured data storage related to proofs and shares, with methods for deserialization. It relies on external types from 'celestia.types' but does not execute untrusted code or handle external input directly. The constructors and deserializers convert dictionaries and lists into strongly-typed objects, following typical patterns without suspicious side-effects or malicious patterns. No network activity, system modifications, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data model implementation for handling cryptographic proof structures. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified. It is a benign, well-structured set of data classes used for serialization/deserialization purposes.",
