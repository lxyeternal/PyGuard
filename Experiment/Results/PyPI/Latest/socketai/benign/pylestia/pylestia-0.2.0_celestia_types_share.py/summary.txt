  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and intended for cryptographic proof data handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The high security risk scores in some reports are unjustified; they should be lowered to reflect the benign nature. The malware score remains at 0, and obfuscated score at 0, with minimal security risk (around 0.0 to 0.1)."
