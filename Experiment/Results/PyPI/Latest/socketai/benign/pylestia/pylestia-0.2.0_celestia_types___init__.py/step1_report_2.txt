{
  "purpose": "Provides fundamental Celestia network data types for compatibility with version 0.11.0+.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.common_types and .errors), and sys for version checking.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; code mainly imports modules.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys module solely for version check is typical; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes from local modules and conditionally imports 'Unpack' from either 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version. No user input, network activity, or data manipulation occurs. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code is clean, minimal, and serves as a compatibility layer.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module focused on importing data types and error handling components for the Celestia network. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
