{
  "purpose": "Provides fundamental data types for interacting with the Celestia network, including blobs, namespaces, commitments, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.common_types and .errors), sys module for Python version checking.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; imports are from internal modules and standard library.",
  "flows": "No flow from external untrusted input to critical functions or data manipulation; no data flows to external outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; straightforward import statements and version check.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and a conditional import based on Python version. It imports core data types and error handling modules from the same package, along with a standard library module 'sys'. The version check for Python 3.11+ for importing 'Unpack' is appropriate and does not introduce malicious behavior. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or credential handling. The code appears to be part of a library setup, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, importing necessary modules based on Python version. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are detected. It is a benign, well-structured piece of code intended to support the package's functionality.",
