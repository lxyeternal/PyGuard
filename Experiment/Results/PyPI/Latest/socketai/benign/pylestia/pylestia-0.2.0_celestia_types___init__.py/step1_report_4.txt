{
  "purpose": "Provides fundamental Celestia data types and error handling for network interaction, with support for version 0.11.0 features.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.common_types and .errors), sys module for version checking.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this snippet; only module imports and conditional type imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly performs static imports and version checks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The use of sys.version_info for conditional imports is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports core data types and error handling modules related to Celestia network interactions. It performs a version check to conditionally import 'Unpack' from either 'typing' or 'typing_extensions', which is a common compatibility pattern. There are no dynamic executions, network calls, or suspicious logic present. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors identified. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for Celestia network data types and error handling with version compatibility. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.",
