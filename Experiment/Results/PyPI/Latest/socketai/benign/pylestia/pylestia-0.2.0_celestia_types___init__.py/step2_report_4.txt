  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module setup, primarily performing imports and version checks.\n- No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling is present.\n- The use of sys.version_info for conditional imports from typing or typing_extensions is standard practice for compatibility.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; imports from local modules and sys.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; the code is a minimal setup for compatibility, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, which seem appropriate.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent reasoning.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, appropriate.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- Similar reasoning; no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, appropriate.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- Same as above; standard compatibility pattern.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, appropriate.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- Same conclusion; benign import statements and version checks.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious code, all scores are correctly 0.\n\n**Potential for Slight Adjustment:**\n- Since the code is entirely benign, the scores are reasonable.\n- The \"securityRisk\" score remains at 0, which is justified.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately scored. The code is a standard, benign module initialization segment with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes are necessary. The reports are thorough, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.",
