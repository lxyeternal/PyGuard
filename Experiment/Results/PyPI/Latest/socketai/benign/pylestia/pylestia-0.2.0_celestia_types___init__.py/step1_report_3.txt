{
  "purpose": "Provides data types and error handling for interacting with the Celestia network, supporting features like Share Version 1.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .common_types and .errors; sys.version_info for conditional import.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data sinks or untrusted data processing identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input sources to sinks; code only performs imports and conditional type checking.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports (.common_types, .errors) is typical for packages, not suspicious; conditional import for typing_extensions Unpack is standard for version compatibility, no malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package module initialization script. It imports core data types and error handling modules, and includes a Python version check to import 'Unpack' from either 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The imports are standard and related to setting up the package's environment and type hints.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical, benign package initialization script for a Python library. No malicious intent, data leaks, or security issues are evident.",
