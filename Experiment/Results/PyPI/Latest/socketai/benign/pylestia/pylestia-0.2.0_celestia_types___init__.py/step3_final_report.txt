{
  "purpose": "Provides fundamental data types and error handling for the Celestia network, ensuring compatibility across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.common_types, .errors) and sys.version_info for version checking.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sinks; purely import statements and version-dependent imports.",
  "flows": "Imports core types and conditionally imports 'Unpack' based on Python version; no data flow beyond module setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports necessary components and performs a version check for compatibility. It contains no dynamic execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The structure and content are standard for a package setup, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The version check for 'Unpack' is a common compatibility pattern. All signals indicate benign, well-structured code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup module for a Python package supporting Celestia data types. No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements are present. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
