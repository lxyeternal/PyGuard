{
  "purpose": "Provide fundamental data types for interacting with the Celestia network, including blobs, namespaces, commitments, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .common_types and .errors; sys.version_info for version checking.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code primarily imports modules and performs version-dependent imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code imports modules and defines compatibility imports based on Python version.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The version check for importing Unpack from typing or typing_extensions is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a module initialization segment for a package. It imports core data types and error handling modules, and includes a version check to import Unpack appropriately for Python >= 3.11. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. All operations are standard for compatibility handling and module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup module for a Python package, providing data types and error handling. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is evident.",
