  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and evaluating the scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward, benign module setup for a Python package.\n- No untrusted data, network activity, or dynamic execution is involved.\n- The code performs standard version-dependent imports for compatibility.\n- The use of relative imports and sys.version_info is standard practice.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The **original code** matches the described purpose: importing core data types and error handling modules, with a version check for importing `Unpack`.\n- No issues are found in the code itself.\n- The reported **scores** for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, justified by the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since no vulnerabilities, secrets, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Not applicable here; all reports and the code itself are benign.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- No discrepancies are observed. The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign, standard module setup for a Python package supporting Celestia network data types.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as safe and non-malicious. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
