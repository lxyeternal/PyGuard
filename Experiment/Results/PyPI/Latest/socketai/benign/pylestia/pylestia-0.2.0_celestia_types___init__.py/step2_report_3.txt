  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the scores and claims.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module that imports local modules (.common_types and .errors), performs a Python version check to conditionally import 'Unpack' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic behavior.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code appears to be a typical compatibility setup for a Python package.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The version check and conditional import are standard practices.\n- All reports are consistent with the code being benign and intended for compatibility.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The code is minimal, clean, and standard for such setup modules.\n\n### Score analysis:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No issues justify a higher risk score; the code is purely import statements and version checks.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a benign, standard compatibility module.\n- The malware score should remain **0**.\n- The obfuscated score should remain **0**.\n- The overall risk score should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a straightforward, benign module setup with no security issues. All scores are appropriate as assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere are no malicious or suspicious elements in this code. The reports are accurate and consistent. The scores should remain at zero across malware, obfuscated, and overall security risk.",
