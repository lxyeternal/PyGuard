{
  "purpose": "The code defines data classes modeling blockchain components such as headers, validators, signatures, commits, data availability headers, extended headers, and states, primarily for data serialization/deserialization.",
  "sources": "Data is read from dictionaries during deserialization; no external data sources or inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; data flows are internal within object instantiations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries into class constructors and deserialization methods, constructing nested objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data class definitions with constructors and deserialization routines. It does not perform network calls, code execution, or external system interactions. The deserialization methods accept untrusted data but do not validate it, which is typical for data models. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious activity. The security risk is minimal (~0.1), primarily due to potential misuse if untrusted data is fed into deserialization routines, but this is standard in such contexts. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and does not pose security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious set of data classes modeling blockchain components. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk and malware scores are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.",
