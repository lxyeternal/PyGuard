  "purpose": "Data structures for representing blockchain consensus, headers, validators, signatures, and state information.",
  "sources": "None (no input reading or external data fetching functions present).",
  "sinks": "None (no functions or code executing untrusted input or data, no output or network operations).",
  "flows": "None (data flow paths are within data class constructors and deserializer methods; no external data handling evident).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines data classes to represent blockchain-related entities such as headers, signatures, validators, and state. Constructors and deserializer methods instantiate objects from provided dictionaries. There are no external input/output operations, network calls, or code that could execute untrusted data. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are apparent. The code is well-structured and adheres to standard patterns for data modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of data structure definitions for blockchain metadata. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or sabotage. It functions as part of a larger system, likely to process or store blockchain data without performing any malicious actions.",
