  "purpose": "Data models for blockchain consensus and header information, used for serialization/deserialization of block data.",
  "sources": "Data input through constructor parameters and deserialized dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe usage if deserialized data is used directly in security-sensitive contexts, but no direct sinks are evident in this code.",
  "flows": "Input data (from external sources) is parsed into class instances; no untrusted data flows explicitly evident, as no data processing or network operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward data modeling with standard constructors and deserialization methods.",
  "analysis": "The code defines numerous data classes for blockchain data structures, including methods for deserializing from dictionaries. There are no network operations, no execution of untrusted code, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic. The only dynamic code is in the deserializer static methods, which instantiate objects from input dictionaries—standard practice in serialization routines. The code structure and syntax are conventional and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data classes intended for representing blockchain consensus and header information. It appears to be standard serialization/deserialization code without malicious behavior or security risks. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or supply chain attacks within this module.",
