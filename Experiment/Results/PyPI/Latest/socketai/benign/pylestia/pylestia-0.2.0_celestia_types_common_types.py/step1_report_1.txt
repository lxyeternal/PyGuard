  "purpose": "Defines core types and classes for handling Celestia data blobs, including Base64 encoding, Namespaces, Commitments, and Blobs with v0.11.0 features.",
  "sources": "Imports from Python standard library (hashlib, typing, base64, dataclasses) and external Rust extension module (celestia._celestia).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified. No direct use of untrusted inputs to execute code or write data outside the module.",
  "flows": "Initialization of Blob objects from various input types, including optional commitment and signer data, involving normalization, decoding, and cryptographic hashing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code dynamically interacts with an external Rust extension, but this alone is not malicious. No obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides data structures for Celestia blobs, with careful handling of data encoding, decoding, and validation. It employs external Rust extensions for normalization and creation of blobs, with fallbacks to cryptographic hash calculations for data integrity. No indicators of malicious intent such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code appears designed for legitimate cryptographic and data management purposes within the specified project. The only external interaction is via a Rust extension, which is standard for performance-sensitive cryptographic operations, not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of core data structures for Celestia with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It handles data encoding, normalization, and cryptographic commitment creation securely. No malicious intent or security risks detected.",
