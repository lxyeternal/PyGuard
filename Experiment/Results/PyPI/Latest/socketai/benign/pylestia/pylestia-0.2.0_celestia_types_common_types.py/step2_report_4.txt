  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines core types for Celestia, no suspicious activity, external Rust extension used for normalization, fallback to hashing.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior detected; external extension is standard for cryptographic operations.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, low risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious intent. The external extension is a common performance optimization, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on normalization, commitment creation, fallback mechanisms.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity; fallback to hashing is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Secure and well-structured.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious behavior detected; external dependencies are standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on data handling, normalization, cryptographic commitments, external extension use.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; reliance on external extension is typical.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate implementation, low risk.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious intent; external extension trust assumed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with focus on normalization, commitment, fallback hashing.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; external extension could be a concern if compromised, but not evidenced here.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Assessment:** Code appears safe; reliance on external extension is standard but warrants trust.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Data structures for blobs, external extension for normalization, fallback hashing.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; external extension used for performance and normalization.\n- **Conclusion:** Well-structured, safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, and the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior—no network activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious commands.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.2), justified by reliance on external Rust extension, which could be a trust concern but not malicious.\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and understandable.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — reliance on external extension is a minor trust consideration but not a security risk.\n\n**Final notes:** The code's purpose is legitimate, handling cryptographic data for Celestia with proper fallback mechanisms. No signs of supply chain sabotage or malicious intent are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | 0              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0              |\n| Risk           | 0.2            |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' findings.",
