{
  "purpose": "Defines core data structures and types for Celestia data availability layer, including Base64 encoding, Namespaces, Commitments, and Blobs with support for v0.11.0 features.",
  "sources": "Reads input data via constructor parameters for Blob, Base64, and Namespace; uses external Rust extension module 'celestia._celestia' for normalization and blob creation.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe use of unvalidated input data when constructing Base64, Namespace, and Blob objects; no explicit sinks for data leakage or system commands; no network or file system operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (strings/bytes) flow into normalization and blob creation functions, with some processing involving decoding, hashing, and external Rust extension calls; data then stored as attributes or used for cryptographic commitments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of external Rust extension introduces potential obfuscation or unreviewed logic, but this is typical in performance-sensitive cryptographic code. Exception handling fallback creates commitments via hashing, which is standard. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious commands, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures with attention to cryptographic integrity, including safety measures like fallback commitment creation if the Rust extension fails. External dependency 'celestia._celestia' is assumed to be trusted for normalization functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, system modification, or data exfiltration. Use of hashing and base64 encoding is standard. The only concern could be reliance on an external extension, but this does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, security-conscious implementation of data types for Celestia, with fallback mechanisms and careful data handling. No malicious intent or malicious code detected. The overall security risk is low.",
