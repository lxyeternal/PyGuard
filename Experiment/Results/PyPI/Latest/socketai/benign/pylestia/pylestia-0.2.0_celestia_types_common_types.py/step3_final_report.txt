{
  "purpose": "Defines core data types for Celestia's data availability layer, including Base64 encoding, Namespaces, Commitments, and Blobs, supporting both unsigned and signed blobs with cryptographic verification.",
  "sources": "External Rust extension module 'celestia._celestia' for normalization and blob creation, data inputs for Base64, Namespace, Commitment, and Blob attributes.",
  "sinks": "Normalization functions, cryptographic commitments, fallback hashing, and data encoding/decoding processes.",
  "flows": "Input data (namespace, data, signer) -> normalization via external extension -> commitment creation (possibly fallback hashing) -> Blob instantiation with attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external Rust extension for normalization and blob processing; fallback to SHA-256 hashing for commitments; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages data structures with cryptographic verification, relying on an external extension for performance-critical operations. Fallback mechanisms ensure robustness. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External dependency trust is a consideration but standard in cryptographic modules. Data flows are straightforward, with no suspicious sinks or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of core Celestia data types, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. External dependencies are typical for cryptographic performance and normalization. The security risk is minimal, and obfuscation is absent.",
