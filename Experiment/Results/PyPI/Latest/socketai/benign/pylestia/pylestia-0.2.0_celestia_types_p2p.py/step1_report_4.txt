  "purpose": "Define data classes and enums for representing resource statistics, bandwidth, address info, and connection states.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines data structures and static deserialization methods.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external output functions are present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flows are established since the code only contains class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are detected. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard data class structures for resource statistics, bandwidth, address info, and enums for connection and reachability statuses. All methods are straightforward constructors and static deserializers. There are no input/output operations, network communications, or external data manipulations. No evidence of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or security issues was found. Usage of type annotations and clear docstrings indicates standard, well-structured code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely defining data structures with deserialization methods, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and intended for organizing resource and network state data without any security risks.",
