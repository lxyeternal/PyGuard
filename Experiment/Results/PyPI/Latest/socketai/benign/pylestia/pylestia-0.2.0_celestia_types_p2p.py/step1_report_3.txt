{
  "purpose": "Define data structures and enums for resource management, bandwidth statistics, address info, and connection status/reachability.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources of untrusted input; deserializer methods accept external dictionaries, but these are typical data conversions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows leading to sensitive actions or outputs identified.",
  "flows": "Deserialization functions take external dictionaries and instantiate data classes, with no complex data flows or processing that could lead to injection or leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code is straightforward data modeling without obfuscated or unusual constructs. No external network access, cryptic code, or malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several data classes and enums with constructors and static deserializer methods, primarily for structuring resource, bandwidth, address, and connection data. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, system manipulation, or data exfiltration. The deserializer methods simply instantiate objects from dictionaries. No external data sources, network calls, or hidden behaviors are present. The code appears to serve as a data schema module, with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard data modeling module with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It merely defines data structures and enums for resource management and network status, with safe deserialization methods. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident.",
