  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical flaws, and the consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is composed of data classes and enums that define structures for resource stats, bandwidth, address info, and connection states.\n- All deserialization methods accept external dictionaries but do not process untrusted data directly or perform any unsafe operations.\n- No network, file I/O, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be standard, well-structured data modeling.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no suspicious features.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly scored.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Analysis:** Same as above, no signs of malicious activity. Slightly elevated security risk score perhaps due to the deserialization of external data, but this is standard practice.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware or malicious intent detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Analysis:** Consistent with previous assessments, no malicious features.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Analysis:** Same as previous; no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Analysis:** Consistent with others, no signs of malware or malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no indication of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, matching the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Very low (0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal security concerns—appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The code is a standard data modeling module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **My Personal Estimate (Post-Review):**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — Given the code's purpose and implementation, security risk is negligible.\n\n**In conclusion,** the reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code appears safe and benign.",
