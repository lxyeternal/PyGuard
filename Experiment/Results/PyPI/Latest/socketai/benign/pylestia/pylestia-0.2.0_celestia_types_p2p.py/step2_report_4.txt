  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code details, the reasoning, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of data classes (`@dataclass`) and enums, with straightforward constructors and static deserializer methods.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or system modifications are present.\n- The deserialization methods accept dictionaries but do not process untrusted data in a way that could lead to code execution or injection.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code appears to be a typical data modeling module for resource and network state information.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is syntactically correct, and the deserializer methods correctly instantiate objects from dictionaries.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None are evident. The deserialization methods do not perform unsafe operations, nor do they process untrusted data in a way that could lead to security issues.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The constructors are explicitly defined despite `@dataclass` automatically generating them; this is redundant but not harmful.\n- The deserializer methods do not handle cases where the input dictionary might be missing keys or malformed; however, this is a minor robustness concern, not a security issue.\n\n### Scores and justification:\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 in all reports — correct, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware:** 0 in all reports — correct, no malware detected.\n- **SecurityRisk:** Generally low, around 0.1, justified by the absence of malicious code but acknowledging the deserialization of external data (which could be risky if misused elsewhere). This is reasonable.\n- **Risk:** All reports assign very low or zero risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The reports consistently identify no malicious or suspicious behavior, which is accurate.\n- The slightly elevated security risk score (~0.1) in some reports is justified given the deserialization of external data, but this is standard and not inherently dangerous.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — **correct**. No malware detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — **correct**. Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** Given the code's nature, I would assign a **risk score of around 0.05 to 0.1**. The current scores (mostly 0 or 0.1) are reasonable, considering the deserialization of external data but no actual security issues.\n\n**Malware justification:** None, as no malicious behavior or payloads are present.\n\n**Obfuscation justification:** None, code is clear and well-structured.\n\n**Overall security risk:** Very low, consistent with the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- Keep the scores as they are, or slightly adjust the risk score to 0.05 for more precision.\n- No further action needed; the code appears benign and well-structured.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Justification                                  |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0 — no malicious activity detected                  |\n| Obfuscated       | 0 — code is straightforward and clear              |\n| Security Risk    | ~0.05 — minimal risk from deserialization of external data, but no actual vulnerabilities |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard data modeling code with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The risk is negligible.",
