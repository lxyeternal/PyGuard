{
  "purpose": "The code defines data structures and enums for managing resource statistics, bandwidth, address info, and connection states, likely used in a network or system monitoring context.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; data is expected to come via deserialization methods from external data (e.g., API responses or configuration files).",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or output operations; no writing to files, network, or environment variables are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows through deserialization methods that instantiate objects from external dictionaries. No untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains straightforward data classes and enums with no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual constructs. The constructors and deserializer methods follow standard patterns without suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of data classes and enum definitions with simple constructors and static deserializer methods. It does not include any code that reads untrusted input dynamically, executes code, or performs network operations. The deserializer methods depend on external data but do not process or transmit it directly. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns. No suspicious or malicious code is detected, and the structure indicates typical data modeling for system/network monitoring purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be standard data modeling structures for managing resource and network statistics. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
