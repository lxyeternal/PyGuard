  "purpose": "Define data classes and enums for managing resource statistics, bandwidth, address info, and connection states.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read; code defines static classes and enums.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output effects involving untrusted data; code only structures data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; deserialization methods accept external dictionaries but do not process untrusted data directly in a security-sensitive manner.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. Constructors and deserializer methods are standard. Enum definitions are straightforward. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple data classes with explicit attributes and static deserialization methods, primarily for structuring data related to resource management and network statistics. The constructor methods assign parameters directly without side effects or external calls. The deserializer methods safely instantiate objects from dictionaries if provided, with no evidence of untrusted input processing or malicious payloads. Enum classes are simple mappings of connection and reachability states, with no suspicious elements. Overall, the code appears to be standard, well-structured data management code with no malicious or suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data modeling module for resource and network statistics, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not perform any external communication, secret handling, or dynamic code execution. Overall security risk is very low.",
