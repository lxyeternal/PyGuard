  "purpose": "Defines data structures and enums for resource management, bandwidth, address info, and connection states, with deserialization methods for external data.",
  "sources": "External dictionaries passed to deserializer methods",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or untrusted data processing present",
  "flows": "Deserialization methods instantiate objects from external dictionaries without executing or processing untrusted data in a harmful way",
  "anomalies": "Redundant explicit __init__ methods despite @dataclass; deserializer does not handle malformed data explicitly",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data classes and enums modeling resource and network state information. Deserialization methods accept external dicts but do not perform unsafe operations or execute code. No network, file I/O, or dynamic code execution is present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and benign. The deserializer's acceptance of external data poses minimal risk, but no actual vulnerabilities are present. The redundant constructors are stylistic but not security issues. Overall, the code is safe, with no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured data modeling with no malicious or suspicious features. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.05). The reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
