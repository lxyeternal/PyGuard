{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for handling proofs, blobs, and commitments in the Celestia network, including serialization/deserialization.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external modules; data class constructors; deserializer method.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is written to external systems or outputs based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., deserialized dict) flows into constructor and deserializer functions, but these are typical data class initializations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward data modeling without any hidden or suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of data classes with constructors and a deserializer. It processes data for Merkle proofs, blob submission results, and commitments, with no external system calls, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The deserializer method safely creates objects from dicts. There are no signs of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured data modeling module for the Celestia project. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as intended for handling cryptographic proof data without engaging in harmful activities.",
