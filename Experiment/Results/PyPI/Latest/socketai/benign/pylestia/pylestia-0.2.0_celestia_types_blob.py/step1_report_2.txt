  "purpose": "Define data structures for representing blobs, proofs, and commitments related to the Celestia network.",
  "sources": "Imports from celestia._celestia and celestia.types.common_types, class initializers, and attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted external data; class initializers accept parameters but do not execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs into class constructors and attributes, especially in deserializer method and __init__ methods, but no direct dangerous flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward data structure definitions with minimal logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data classes for various cryptographic proofs and network results in the Celestia context. __init__ methods explicitly assign and process input parameters, but they do not execute untrusted code. The deserializer method conditionally reconstructs an object from a dictionary, which is standard. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code does not perform network I/O, system commands, or access environment variables, nor does it contain obfuscated logic or hidden data exfiltration. All code appears to be a safe, well-structured data model definition.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of data classes for representing blockchain proof data with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It serves as a structured data container for cryptographic proofs and network responses, and it does not contain any malware or security risks.",
