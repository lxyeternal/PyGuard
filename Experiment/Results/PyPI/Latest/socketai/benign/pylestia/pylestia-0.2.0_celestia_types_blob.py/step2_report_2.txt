  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Defines data structures for submission and subscription results, Merkle proofs, and commitment proofs in Celestia.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, network activity, or dynamic execution. The deserializer method is straightforward.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely data modeling with no evident malicious behavior. The low security risk score (0.2) is reasonable given the context, but overall, the code appears safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Defines data structures for blobs, proofs, and commitments.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, no network or dangerous operations. Constructors and deserializer are standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity detected. The code is a straightforward data container.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Data structures for handling proofs, results, and commitments.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious logic or external data processing.\n- **Scores:** Malware score remains 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** Safe, standard data class definitions.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Defines data structures for proofs, results, and serialization.\n- **Analysis:** No external system calls or dangerous logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Data classes for proofs, blobs, and commitments.\n- **Analysis:** Similar benign characteristics.\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports indicate no obfuscation.\n- **Malware scores:** Consistently 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n- **Security risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of data structures.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code is a typical data modeling layer for blockchain proofs and results.\n- No evidence suggests any malicious intent or backdoors.\n- The deserialization methods are straightforward and do not perform unsafe operations.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, due to the handling of untrusted data in deserialization, but no actual danger)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured, and serves as a data container for cryptographic proofs in the Celestia network. No security concerns or malware indicators are present.",
