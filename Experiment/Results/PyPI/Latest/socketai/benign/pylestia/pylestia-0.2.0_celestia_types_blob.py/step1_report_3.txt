{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for handling and verifying data and proofs within the Celestia network, including submission results, subscriptions, and cryptographic proofs.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; the code primarily defines classes and constructors.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that handle untrusted input; the code only initializes data structures.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code constructs data objects and deserializes data.",
  "anomalies": "The __init__ methods accept parameters directly without validation or sanitization; the code uses tuple comprehensions that could be simplified but do not pose security issues. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various @dataclass structures to represent results and cryptographic proofs related to the Celestia blockchain. The constructors (__init__) mainly assign provided parameters to attributes, with minimal processing. The deserializer method for CommitmentProof simply reconstructs an object from a dictionary. There are no evident operations involving untrusted data processing, network calls, or storage access. The code does not include any obfuscated or malicious constructs. It appears to be a straightforward data modeling module, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign data structure definition module for cryptographic proofs and network results in Celestia. It contains no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. The code is well-structured and does not handle untrusted data in a dangerous manner. Overall, the risk is negligible.",
