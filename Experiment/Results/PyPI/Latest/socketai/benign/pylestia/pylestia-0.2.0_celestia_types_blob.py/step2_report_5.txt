  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the provided summaries, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines data structures for submission and subscription results, and proofs in Celestia. No external data reading or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is benign, straightforward data classes, no network, no code injection, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. The low risk score seems appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Justification for scores:** The code is purely data modeling, no malicious activity. The risk score could be slightly increased if considering deserialization from untrusted data, but overall, 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining data structures for blobs, proofs, and commitments.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, no suspicious patterns, straightforward data classes.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1. This aligns well with the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No external operations or dangerous constructs.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines data structures for handling and verifying data and proofs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Again, standard data classes, no external calls, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. Slightly higher but still appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, focusing on proofs, results, and serialization.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code, no external system interaction.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Data classes for proofs, blobs, commitments, serialization.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity, no external calls.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe code that is purely data structures with constructors and deserialization methods. No network calls, no code execution, no handling of untrusted data beyond simple deserialization, which is standard practice.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are zero, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero, reflecting minimal inherent risk in deserialization but still very low, which is appropriate.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, considering deserialization from untrusted data; perhaps slightly higher if considering potential misuse, but still negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe code is a typical data modeling layer for blockchain proofs, with no signs of malicious intent. The scores assigned are reasonable, and I would not suggest significant changes.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1\n\nThese reflect the benign, transparent nature of the code.",
