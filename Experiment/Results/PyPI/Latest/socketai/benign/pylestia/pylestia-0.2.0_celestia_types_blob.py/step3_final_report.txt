{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for blockchain proof verification, submission results, and cryptographic components in Celestia.",
  "sources": "Data class attributes, constructors, and deserialization methods reading from dictionaries or initializing attributes.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries into object attributes via constructors and deserializer, with no external or untrusted data processing beyond standard deserialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data classes modeling blockchain proof components, with straightforward constructors and deserialization methods. There are no network calls, code injections, or external system interactions. The deserialization methods are simple and do not perform unsafe operations. The code is clean, well-structured, and serves as a data container for cryptographic proofs and results. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data modeling layer for Celestia blockchain proofs and results. It poses no security risks or malicious intent, with scores appropriately set to zero for malware and obfuscation, and a very low risk score reflecting minimal deserialization concerns.",
