{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and classes for handling submissions, subscriptions, proofs, and commitment proofs related to the Celestia network, facilitating data verification and interaction with the blockchain.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (dataclasses), external module (celestia._celestia), and project-specific types (celestia.types.common_types). No input or data reading from external sources within the code itself.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code primarily creates data structures and does not perform actions such as network requests, file operations, or executing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to class attribute initialization and deserialization methods. No external untrusted data flows directly into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses constructors and type annotations to initialize objects from dictionaries but does not perform any suspicious dynamic code execution, eval, or similar unsafe operations. The deserializer method is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of data classes and initialization methods for representing various cryptographic proofs, block data, and submission results in the Celestia blockchain context. It imports external modules and types, but there is no indication of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The deserializer method is standard for reconstructing objects from dicts, which is common in serialization workflows. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present. Overall, the structure and content are typical for a blockchain data handling library.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data modeling layer for Celestia blockchain interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code segment.",
