  "purpose": "Provide a Python client library for interacting with the Celestia blockchain platform, including API access and data structures.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code primarily imports a module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or execution effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process or transfer data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or unusual behaviors observed. The code is a straightforward documentation and import setup.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a module docstring describing its purpose, supported features, and references. It defines a version string and imports a single class from an external module. There are no input handling, data processing, or security-sensitive operations present. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The code appears to be a typical package initialization file with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign package initialization script providing documentation and a simple import. No malicious activity, suspicious behavior, or security risks are identified.",
