  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its context, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- The provided code is primarily documentation, comments, version declaration, and a single import statement:\n  \n  ```python\n  from celestia.node_api import Client\n  ```\n  \n- There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code does not handle untrusted data, secrets, or perform any I/O.\n- The package appears to be a straightforward SDK or client library for the Celestia blockchain.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Describes a Python client for Celestia.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the absence of executable logic, data handling, or suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malware or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Package initialization and documentation.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, confirms no data processing or malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Provide a client interface.\n- **Analysis:** Identical to previous assessments; straightforward import and comments.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Client library with API access.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Client interface.\n- **Analysis:** Same as others; no data flows or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are any issues present in the code?**  \n  No. The code is purely documentation and a simple import statement.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and security risks are also 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- **Should any scores be higher?**  \n  No. The code does not contain any malicious or obfuscated elements, nor does it perform any risky operations.\n\n- **Is there any suspicious or malicious behavior?**  \n  No. The import is standard, and the code is non-executable documentation.\n\n- **Any assumptions that are unwarranted?**  \n  No. The analysis is consistent with the code provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a minimal, well-documented package initialization with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The provided scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0",
