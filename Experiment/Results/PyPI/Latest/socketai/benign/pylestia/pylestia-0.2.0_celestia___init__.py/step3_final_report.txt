  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal package initialization and documentation snippet for the pylestia Python client, providing version info and importing the main Client class for interacting with the Celestia blockchain platform.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from celestia.node_api import Client' reads from the internal module 'celestia.node_api'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the import is static and does not involve runtime data transfer or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, containing only documentation, a version string, and a simple import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a non-executable, documentation-focused snippet with a version assignment and an import statement. It contains no functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The import is standard and assumes the module exists and is legitimate. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns support a conclusion of no security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initialization snippet with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or suspicion is warranted based on this code fragment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
