  "purpose": "Provide a Python client interface for interacting with the Celestia blockchain platform API.",
  "sources": "Imports the Client class from the celestia.node_api module.",
  "targets": "The imported Client class may be used elsewhere in the package; no direct data handling or input/output is present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable as the code is mainly documentation and an import statement; no untrusted data or user input is processed here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code features are present. The code contains only descriptive comments, version info, and an import statement.",
  "analysis": "This code consists solely of package-level documentation, version declaration, and an import statement for the Client class. There are no functions, data processing, or user input handling. The import statement itself does not pose security risks and is standard practice. The comments describe the package's purpose but do not indicate any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module initialization snippet with no malicious code, suspicious behavior, or security issues detected. It functions as a simple package entry point with descriptive comments and an import. There is no evidence of malware or security risks.",
