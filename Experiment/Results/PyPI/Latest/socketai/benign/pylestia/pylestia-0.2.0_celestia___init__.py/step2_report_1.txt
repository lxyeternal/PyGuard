  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\n\nThe code consists solely of a descriptive comment header, a version assignment, and an import statement:\n\n```python\n__version__ = \"0.1.7\"\nfrom celestia.node_api import Client\n```\n\nThere are no functions, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The import statement is straightforward, referencing an internal module.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- No signs of obfuscated code.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No network activity, data handling, or user input processing.\n- The code is a minimal package initialization and documentation snippet.\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n\nAll five reports conclude similarly:\n- The code is benign, mainly documentation and an import statement.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity is identified.\n- The confidence scores are high (1), and all indicate no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### Potential Issues or Discrepancies:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign malware = 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Also 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, which seems appropriate given the content.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is a simple package entry point with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based solely on the code snippet.\n- The import of `Client` from `celestia.node_api` is standard and does not pose security concerns unless the imported module is malicious, which cannot be determined from this snippet alone.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The code and reports are aligned; no changes are necessary.\n- The overall security risk is negligible.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|-------------------|------------|\n| **0**           | **0**             | **0**      |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a harmless package initializer with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.",
