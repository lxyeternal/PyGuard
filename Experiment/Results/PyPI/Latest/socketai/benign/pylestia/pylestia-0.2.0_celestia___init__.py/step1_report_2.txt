  "purpose": "The code serves as a Python package initialization and documentation for the pylestia client for the Celestia blockchain platform.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; only imports a module (celestia.node_api).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or potential data leaks; no processing of untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily provides documentation and an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a descriptive comment header, version assignment, and a single import statement. It does not process or handle untrusted data, nor does it perform network connections, file operations, or execute dynamic code. The import statement is straightforward, referencing a module within the package. Overall, the code appears to be standard package initialization code without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer with documentation. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
