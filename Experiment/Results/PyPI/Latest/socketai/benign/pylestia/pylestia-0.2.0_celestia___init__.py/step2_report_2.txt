  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is minimal: a descriptive comment header, a version string, and an import statement.\n- No executable logic, data processing, network operations, or data handling is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n- The import statement is straightforward and standard for package initialization.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as benign, mainly documentation and an import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Same as above; the code is benign package setup.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No issues.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Again, a benign import and documentation.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No issues.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No issues.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Similar benign assessment.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. The code is just documentation, version info, and an import statement. No malicious or suspicious activity is present.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, which is consistent with the code content.\n\n- **Potential for higher risk scores?**  \n  No. The code does not perform any network operations, data handling, or contain suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Since no malicious activity is present, malware=0 is correct.\n\n- **Obfuscation:**  \n  The code is straightforward, so obfuscated=0 is correct.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Zero risk is justified, as there's no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores are appropriate. No further action or suspicion is warranted based on this code snippet.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.",
