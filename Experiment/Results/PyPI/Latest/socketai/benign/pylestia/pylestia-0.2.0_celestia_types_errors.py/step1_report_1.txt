{
  "purpose": "This code provides error handling utilities for Celestia blob submission operations, including error code definitions and parsing functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from error messages (error_message parameter) passed into parse_error_message function.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the returned error code and message tuple, which could influence error handling logic downstream.",
  "flows": "The input error message is analyzed in parse_error_message, matching against known patterns to output structured error info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code follows standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum for error codes related to Celestia operations and provides a function to parse error messages into these codes. It uses string matching to identify known errors. The logic appears straightforward and safe, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data handling. There are no external data fetches, network operations, or other risky behaviors. The function only processes and categorizes error messages, which is typical for error handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured error handling utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely within expected parameters, parsing error strings to structured data without performing any harmful actions.",
