  "purpose": "Provides error handling, error code definitions, and parsing utilities for Celestia operations, particularly related to blob submissions.",
  "sources": "Input error messages received from exceptions or external error outputs during Celestia node interactions.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code does not perform any unsafe or malicious actions, nor does it output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "Error message strings are analyzed and matched against known patterns to produce structured error codes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard enum and string matching for error parsing. No suspicious patterns or obfuscated constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a clear enumeration of error codes and a parsing function that matches known error message patterns to these codes. The function is straightforward, using dictionary-based string containment checks without dynamic code execution or external data manipulation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. Usage of standard Python features suggests a typical, safe error handling utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign error handling module for structured error parsing in Celestia operations. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are detected. It follows standard coding practices with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
