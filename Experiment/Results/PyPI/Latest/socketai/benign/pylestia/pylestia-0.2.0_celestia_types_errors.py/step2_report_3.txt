  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, evaluating the reasoning, and ensuring consistency in scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward, standard error handling utility.\n- The code defines an enum for error codes and a parsing function that matches substrings in error messages.\n- No external data fetching, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code appears well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- The pattern matching relies solely on string containment checks, which are safe in this context.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No, all reports agree that the code is benign, with no vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as a standard error parsing utility.\n\n- **Scores given to each issue?**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature. The security risk scores are also 0, matching the assessment.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are 0, which is justified.\n\n- **Malware score justification?**  \n  The code does not perform any malicious actions, so malware scores are correctly 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No, all analyses are based on the code's actual behavior.\n\n- **Consistency of scores?**  \n  Yes, all reports are consistent with each other and with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- The code is a typical, safe error handling utility.  \n- The pattern matching approach is straightforward and does not introduce security concerns.  \n- No obfuscation or malicious code is present.  \n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, safe error parsing utility for Celestia operations. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0. The code poses no security threat.",
