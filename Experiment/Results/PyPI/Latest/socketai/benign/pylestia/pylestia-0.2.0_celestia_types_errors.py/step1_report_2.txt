  "purpose": "Define error codes and parsing utilities for handling errors during Celestia operations, particularly blob submissions.",
  "sources": "Error messages passed to parse_error_message function.",
  "sinks": "The function processes error messages; no data sinks or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Error message string flows into parse_error_message, which matches patterns to known error codes and returns structured data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code structures detected; code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum for error codes, mapping various known error patterns to these codes. The parse_error_message function searches for specific substrings within an error message to identify the corresponding error code. Usage of enums and pattern matching is standard. No hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors are present. The function operates solely on string matching without any external side effects, and no external data or environment variables are accessed. Overall, the code functions as a structured error parser with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation for structured error handling related to Celestia operations. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior and poses no security threats.",
