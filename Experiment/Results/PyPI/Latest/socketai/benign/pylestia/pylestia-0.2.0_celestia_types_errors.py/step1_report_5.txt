  "purpose": "Provide structured error handling and parsing utilities for Celestia node errors related to blob submissions.",
  "sources": "Input is from the error_message argument of the parse_error_message function, which reads error strings, likely from exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Returns structured error code and message; no direct sinks that process untrusted data beyond parsing and returning.",
  "flows": "Error message input → error pattern matching → return corresponding ErrorCode and message; no further data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard enum and string matching techniques; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enum for error codes and a function to parse error messages for known patterns, returning structured data. It uses straightforward string matching without obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or external network operations. The pattern matching relies on lowercase comparison of error message substrings to map to enum values. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are apparent, and the logic is standard error handling. The overall design is consistent with expected error parsing utilities in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for error parsing related to Celestia node operations. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It performs standard string pattern matching for known error messages, with no external side effects or suspicious behaviors.",
