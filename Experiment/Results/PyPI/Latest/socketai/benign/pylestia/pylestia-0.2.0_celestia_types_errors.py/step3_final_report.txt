  "purpose": "Provides structured error codes and parsing utilities for handling errors during Celestia blob operations, aligning with celestia-types v0.11.0+.",
  "sources": "Error message strings received from exceptions or node responses.",
  "sinks": "Error code and description tuple returned for further handling or user notification.",
  "flows": "Error message string -> pattern matching in parse_error_message -> ErrorCode enum + message tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward string containment checks for pattern matching.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enum for error codes and a function that matches substrings within error messages to these codes. It performs simple, case-insensitive substring checks, which are safe and reliable. No external data, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The pattern matching is direct and transparent, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe error handling utility with no malicious or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
