  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code defines error codes via an Enum.\n- The parse_error_message function performs string matching on error messages to map to these codes.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external dependencies, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Consistency:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports indicate that the code performs string matching on error messages to produce structured error codes. No issues or vulnerabilities are identified.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No errors or flaws are apparent in the logic or implementation. The pattern matching is simple and reliable for the purpose.\n\n- **Scores given to issues:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or near-zero, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports suggest any risk higher than 0.1. The highest confidence score is 1, but that pertains to correctness, not risk.\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign malware score as 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All analyses are consistent with the code's actual behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- The code is a typical error parsing utility, with pattern matching and enum definitions.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.\n- The pattern matching relies on lowercase substrings, which is a common approach.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (or very close to zero) — since it's standard error handling code with no security issues.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, well-structured error handling utility with no malicious or security concerns. The scores and reasoning in all reports are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is straightforward, safe, and free of malicious behavior.  \n- No changes to the reported scores are necessary.  \n- The overall risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0 or near-zero.\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low)",
