  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code defines an enum of error codes related to Celestia blob submission operations.\n- It provides a function `parse_error_message` that matches substrings within error messages to these codes.\n- The implementation uses straightforward string containment checks, with no external data fetching, dynamic code execution, or network operations.\n- The code appears to be a standard error parsing utility.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  The reports do not identify any actual issues or vulnerabilities. They uniformly describe the code as standard, safe, and well-structured.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code's logic appears correct for its purpose.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the code's behavior. The security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**  \n  Given the code's simplicity—defining enums and performing string matching—malware or obfuscation scores should indeed be zero. No suspicious or malicious code is present.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  The risk score is 0 across all reports, which is justified. The code is purely for error categorization and does not perform any harmful actions.\n\n- **Potential assumptions:**  \n  All reports correctly assume that matching substrings in error messages is sufficient for error classification. This is standard practice but could be fragile if error messages change, but that doesn't imply malicious intent.\n\n- **Any overlooked issues?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and safe. There are no signs of backdoors, secret data, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, standard utility for error parsing, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. They correctly identify the code as safe, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior. The error handling logic is conventional, and the pattern matching approach is appropriate for this context.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain the current scores.  \n- No changes needed.  \n- The code poses no security threat.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure error message patterns are kept up-to-date to avoid misclassification, but this does not impact security or malware assessments.",
