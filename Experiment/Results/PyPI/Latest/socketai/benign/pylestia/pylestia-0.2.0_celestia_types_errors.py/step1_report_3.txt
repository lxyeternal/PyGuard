  "purpose": "To provide error handling, parsing, and categorization utilities for Celestia blob submission errors.",
  "sources": "The function parse_error_message reads from the input error_message parameter (string). No other external data sources are accessed.",
  "sinks": "The code returns a tuple of ErrorCode and string; no direct sinks or data leaks are present. No malicious data flow is evident.",
  "flows": "Input string error_message flows into parse_error_message, which matches patterns to known error codes and returns structured data. No untrusted data is used insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. Error pattern matching is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enumeration for error codes related to Celestia operations, facilitating structured error handling. The parse_error_message function matches substrings in error messages to known error patterns to identify specific error codes. The patterns are all lowercase strings that look for known error indicators, and the matching process is simple and direct. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors. The code is well-structured, with clear comments and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a utility for structured error parsing in Celestia operations and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is straightforward and safe.",
