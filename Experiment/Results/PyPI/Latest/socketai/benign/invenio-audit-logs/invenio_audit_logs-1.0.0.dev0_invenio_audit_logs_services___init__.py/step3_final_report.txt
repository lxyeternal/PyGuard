  "purpose": "Module initialization and exposing internal classes for audit log services.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.config, .schema, .service). No external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not suspicious or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports internal components and exposes them via __all__. It contains only import statements and licensing comments, with no data processing, input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns are present. The malware score is correctly 0, as there is no malicious behavior. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting clarity. The security risk score is very low, and slightly above zero in some reports due to the future date, but this is negligible. Overall, the code is benign and standard for a package's __init__.py or module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The existing reports are accurate; minor adjustments to risk scores (setting them to 0) are recommended for reports 1 and 2, while the others are appropriate.",
