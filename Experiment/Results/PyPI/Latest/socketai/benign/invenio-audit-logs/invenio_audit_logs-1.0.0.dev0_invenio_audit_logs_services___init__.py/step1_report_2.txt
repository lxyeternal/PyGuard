  "purpose": "This code defines and exports components related to an audit log service for the Invenio framework, including configuration, schema, and service classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .config, .schema, .service",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling evident",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows involving untrusted input or external data processing",
  "anomalies": "Standard module metadata and licensing comments; no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup defining __all__ for exports, importing internal components, and including license and copyright comments. It does not process input, handle untrusted data, or execute any dynamic or malicious code. The presence of a copyright statement for 2025 and licensing info is normal for software distribution. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module initialization for an audit log service component with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
