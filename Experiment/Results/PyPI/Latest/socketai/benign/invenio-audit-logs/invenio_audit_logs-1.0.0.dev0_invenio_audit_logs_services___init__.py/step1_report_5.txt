  "purpose": "Module for audit log services in a larger application, providing configuration, schema, and service components.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .config, .schema, .service",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no user input or external data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; simply imports and exports of classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard module structure with no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports configuration, schema, and service classes, then exposes them via __all__. It includes a copyright notice and licensing information but no executable code, data handling, or external interactions. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious activities are evident. The code appears to be part of a larger project for audit logging, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module for an audit logging system with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
