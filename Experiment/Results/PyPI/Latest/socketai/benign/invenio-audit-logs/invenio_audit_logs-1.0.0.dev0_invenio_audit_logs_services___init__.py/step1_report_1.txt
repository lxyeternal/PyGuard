  "flows": "The code only sets up imports and exports; no data flow or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a copyright notice indicating year 2025, which is in the future, but this is not suspicious, just unusual. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports configuration, schema, and service classes and exposes them via __all__. No user input, data processing, or network operations are present. No malicious intent or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a larger application, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
