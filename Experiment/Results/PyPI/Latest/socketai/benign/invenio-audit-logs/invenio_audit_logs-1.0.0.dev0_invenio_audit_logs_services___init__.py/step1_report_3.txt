{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports components related to audit log services, including configuration, schema, and service classes, for use in an application.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules (.config, .schema, .service) and reads no external or untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or exposed.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious or unusual code, or hidden behaviors are present. The copyright date is in the future (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that sets up imports and exports for an audit logging service. It includes a copyright statement with a future date, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No data processing, user input handling, or external communication is present. The structure is typical for a Python package module, with no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign component of a larger application, primarily setting up module exports. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code.",
