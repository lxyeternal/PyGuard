  "purpose": "Define a Flask blueprint for the Invenio-Audit-Logs API and provide a function to create this blueprint within a Flask app.",
  "sources": "Import statement for Flask Blueprint; access to app.extensions in create_audit_logs_blueprint function.",
  "sinks": "Access to app.extensions['invenio-audit-logs'] and invocation of audit_log_resource.as_blueprint().",
  "flows": "create_audit_logs_blueprint reads app.extensions and calls as_blueprint() on audit_log_resource.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears straightforward and consistent with Flask app extension pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Flask's Blueprint, defines a blueprint, and provides a function to attach an audit logs resource to the Flask app. The function accesses app.extensions with a specific key and calls a method to generate a blueprint. No input parsing, external data handling, or suspicious operations are present. There are no hardcoded secrets, no network calls, and no obfuscated or dynamic code execution. The code is typical for a Flask extension setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Flask blueprint setup for audit log API and contains no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
