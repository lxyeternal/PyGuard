  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe similar code: importing Flask's Blueprint, accessing `app.extensions[\"invenio-audit-logs\"]`, and returning a blueprint via `ext.audit_log_resource.as_blueprint()`.\n- The code is straightforward, standard Flask extension pattern, with no input handling, no external network calls, no secrets, and no obfuscation.\n- All reports confidently conclude that the code is safe, with a confidence score of 1 and malware score of 0.\n\n**Confirming issues:**\n- The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious operations. It merely creates and returns a Flask blueprint from an extension.\n- No security vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malware are evident.\n- The logic is sound, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n- Security risk is 0, consistent with the code's straightforward nature.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems justified given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- Since the code is part of a larger system, one might consider whether `app.extensions[\"invenio-audit-logs\"]` could be maliciously replaced or tampered with. However, based solely on this code snippet, there is no indication of such issues.\n- The reports do not mention any dynamic code execution or external data handling, which are common vectors for security issues.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is standard, safe, and free of malicious behavior.\n- No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n- The overall risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence remains at 1, as the analysis is straightforward.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is a typical Flask extension setup for API blueprints with no security concerns.",
