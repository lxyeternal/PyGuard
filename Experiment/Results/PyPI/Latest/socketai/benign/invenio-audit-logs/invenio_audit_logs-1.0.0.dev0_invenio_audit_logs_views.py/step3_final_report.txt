  "purpose": "Create and return a Flask blueprint for audit logs by accessing an extension from the app's extensions registry.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from 'app.extensions' to retrieve 'invenio-audit-logs' extension.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code accesses 'app.extensions['invenio-audit-logs']' and calls 'ext.audit_log_resource.as_blueprint()' to produce a blueprint object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Flask setup that creates a blueprint for audit logs by retrieving an extension from the app's extensions dictionary and returning its blueprint. It contains no input handling, external calls, or dynamic code execution. The pattern is standard, with no signs of malicious activity or security flaws. The code's clarity and lack of suspicious operations justify a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Flask extension pattern with no vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. All reports' assessments are accurate and justified. No security concerns are present.",
