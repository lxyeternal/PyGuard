  "purpose": "Define a Flask blueprint for the Invenio-Audit-Logs API.",
  "sources": "Import statement for Flask Blueprint; access to app.extensions['invenio-audit-logs'].",
  "sinks": "Returning a blueprint object via ext.audit_log_resource.as_blueprint().",
  "flows": "The function create_audit_logs_blueprint retrieves a resource from app.extensions and converts it into a Flask blueprint.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code. The code is straightforward and standard for Flask applications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Flask blueprint and a function to create and return the blueprint from an extension. It imports Flask components, creates a blueprint object, and uses the app's extension registry to obtain and return a resource blueprint. No input/output handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network or file operations are present. The code appears to be a standard setup function for Flask extensions, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Flask application component that sets up an API blueprint for audit logs. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward.",
