{
  "purpose": "Define a Flask blueprint for the Invenio-Audit-Logs API and create a function to generate the blueprint.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Flask app's extensions dictionary to access 'invenio-audit-logs'.",
  "sinks": "The code accesses 'ext.audit_log_resource.as_blueprint()', which likely generates a Flask blueprint.",
  "flows": "The function 'create_audit_logs_blueprint' retrieves the extension object and calls its method to create a blueprint.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports Flask, creates a blueprint object, and defines a function to generate a blueprint from an extension. It references an extension object from the app's extensions, which is standard practice in Flask applications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or obfuscation. The code's purpose appears to be to facilitate API endpoint creation for audit logs in a web application, with no evident security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Flask setup for API blueprints with no malicious or suspicious elements. It appears safe and well-structured for its intended purpose.",
