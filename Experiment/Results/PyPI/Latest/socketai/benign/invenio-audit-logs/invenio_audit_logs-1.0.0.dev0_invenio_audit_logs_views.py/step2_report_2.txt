  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is a straightforward Flask setup, importing Blueprint, accessing an extension via `app.extensions`, and returning a blueprint object from a method call. There are no signs of vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation. The code is standard and safe.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that the code is a typical Flask pattern with no suspicious logic. No logical errors or security flaws are detected or claimed.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Confidence: 1 (high confidence)\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0\n\n   These scores seem reasonable given the analysis. Since the code is standard, no change in scoring is necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   The risk scores are all zero, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any external network calls, handle sensitive data, or execute dynamic code. No security issues are present.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is zero in all reports, which aligns with the code's nature. No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid assumptions; they only describe what the code does. Their reasoning is sound.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analyses. No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Overall**, the code is a standard Flask extension pattern with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThe code is safe, and the scores should reflect that.",
