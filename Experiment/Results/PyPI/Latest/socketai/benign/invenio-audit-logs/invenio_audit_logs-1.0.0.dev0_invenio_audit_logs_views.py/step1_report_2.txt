  "purpose": "Define Flask blueprint for the Invenio-Audit-Logs API and create an extension blueprint.",
  "sources": "Importing Flask Blueprint; accessing app.extensions['invenio-audit-logs']; calling ext.audit_log_resource.as_blueprint()",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling, no external network calls, or dangerous operations present.",
  "flows": "Blueprint creation from extension resource; no data flow from external input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and adheres to typical Flask extension patterns; no unusual or suspicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Flask Blueprint, sets up a blueprint object, and defines a function to create a blueprint from an extension. There are no user inputs, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no network activity. The use of 'app.extensions' is standard for Flask extensions, and the function simply returns a pre-defined resource blueprint. No anomalies or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Flask setup for registering a blueprint from an extension. It contains no malicious behavior or security issues. It is safe and appears to be part of a typical web application setup.",
