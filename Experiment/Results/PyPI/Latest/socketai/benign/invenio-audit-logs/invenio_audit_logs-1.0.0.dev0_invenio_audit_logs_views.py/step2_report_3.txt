  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code snippets are very straightforward Flask setup functions.\n- They import `Blueprint`, access `app.extensions[\"invenio-audit-logs\"]`, and return a blueprint via `ext.audit_log_resource.as_blueprint()`.\n- No user input, no external network calls, no file operations, no secrets, no dynamic code execution.\n- All reports conclude the code is standard, safe, and free of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in code:\n- The code itself does not contain any vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- The pattern used is standard for Flask extensions, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the code snippets.\n- The logic and reasoning in all reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Confidence:** All reports assign 1, which is appropriate given the code's clarity and standard pattern.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5; all are 0, which is justified.\n- The code does not perform any risky operations, so a higher score isn't warranted.\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- Since no malicious activity is detected, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The code simply creates and returns a Flask blueprint; no malware behavior is present.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as standard Flask setup.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security issues or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical Flask extension pattern for creating blueprints. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The review confirms the code is safe, with no need for adjustments in the scoring.",
