  "purpose": "Define Flask view functions and create a blueprint for the Invenio-Audit-Logs API.",
  "sources": "Importing 'Blueprint' from Flask, accessing 'app.extensions' and 'ext.audit_log_resource'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct data leaks or security-sensitive operations are performed.",
  "flows": "The function accesses an extension from the app's extensions dictionary and returns a blueprint object.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with standard Flask pattern; no suspicious or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Flask's Blueprint, defines a function to create a blueprint using an extension from the app, and returns the blueprint object. It does not include any input parsing, data processing, or external network operations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic is present. The code appears to be a standard Flask setup for API routing, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Flask blueprint setup for an API module with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It is safe and standard for web API definitions.",
