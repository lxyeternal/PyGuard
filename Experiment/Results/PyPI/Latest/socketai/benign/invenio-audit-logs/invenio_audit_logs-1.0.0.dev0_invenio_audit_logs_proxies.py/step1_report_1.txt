  "purpose": "Define a proxy to access the 'audit_log_service' from the 'invenio-audit-logs' extension within a Flask application.",
  "sources": "Access to 'current_app.extensions' dictionary to retrieve 'invenio-audit-logs' extension.",
  "sinks": "Usage of the 'LocalProxy' to lazily evaluate and access 'audit_log_service' on demand.",
  "flows": "The lambda function retrieves 'audit_log_service' from 'current_app.extensions['invenio-audit-logs']' whenever 'current_audit_logs_service' is accessed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard Flask extension practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'current_app' from Flask and 'LocalProxy' from Werkzeug, then creates a proxy object 'current_audit_logs_service' which, when accessed, fetches the 'audit_log_service' from the current Flask application's extensions. This pattern is common for lazy-loading services in Flask applications. No user input, external data sources, or untrusted data handling is involved. The code does not contain any obfuscation, malicious payload, or suspicious logic. It solely provides a proxy interface for a service component.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Flask proxy setup for accessing a service extension. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is clean and follows common patterns for Flask extension usage.",
