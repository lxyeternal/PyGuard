  "purpose": "Define a proxy to access the 'audit_log_service' within the Flask application's extensions.",
  "sources": "current_app.extensions['invenio-audit-logs'].audit_log_service",
  "sinks": "Accessing the 'audit_log_service' via the proxy could lead to unintended use if the service is misconfigured, but no direct data sink or external call is present.",
  "flows": "current_app (source) -> extension dictionary -> audit_log_service (sink via proxy)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code is a straightforward proxy definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a LocalProxy object that lazily evaluates to retrieve the audit_log_service from the current Flask application's extensions. The proxy pattern is common in Flask applications for deferred resolution of services. The code appears standard and does not include obfuscation, malicious logic, or external data leaks. It relies on the correct configuration of the Flask app and extensions but does not introduce security issues itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard proxy setup to access a service within a Flask app's extension system. There are no indications of malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks in this snippet.",
