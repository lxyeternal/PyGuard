  "purpose": "Proxy to access the 'audit_log_service' from the 'invenio-audit-logs' extension within a Flask application.",
  "sources": "current_app.extensions['invenio-audit-logs'].audit_log_service accessed via lambda in LocalProxy",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only provides a proxy to a service object",
  "flows": "Lambda retrieves 'audit_log_service' from Flask's current_app.extensions when the proxy is accessed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward proxy pattern with no suspicious logic or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Flask LocalProxy that lazily retrieves a service instance from the application's extensions. It contains no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The pattern is standard for Flask applications. The proxy simply forwards calls to the 'audit_log_service'. No external data is processed or transmitted insecurely. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate no malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Flask proxy pattern with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the security of the external extension, not the code itself. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The low risk score (~0.1) reflects external factors but is appropriate given the code's nature.",
