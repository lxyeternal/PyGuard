  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Flask proxy pattern with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the security of the external extension, not the code itself. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The low risk score (~0.1) reflects external factors but is appropriate given the code's nature."
