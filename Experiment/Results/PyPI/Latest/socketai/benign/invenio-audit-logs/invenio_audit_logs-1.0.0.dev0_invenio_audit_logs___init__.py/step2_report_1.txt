  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code in all reports is a minimal, standard Python module initialization script.\n- It contains license headers, version info, import statements, and export definitions.\n- No user input, external data sources, network communication, or dynamic code execution.\n- No suspicious or obfuscated code patterns.\n- The import is from a local module `.ext`, which is typical for extension packages.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, assigning malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward module setup with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and scoring review:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n#### Confidence:\n- All reports show full confidence (1), which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The only minor point is the copyright date: \"2025\" is future-dated, which is unusual but not malicious. It might be a typo or placeholder, but it doesn't impact security.\n\n### Are any scores unreasonable?\n- No. The scores are consistent with the code's content and reasoning.\n\n### Any claims based on assumptions?\n- No. All reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese match the evidence and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard module setup with no malicious or security issues. The scores are appropriate, and the reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code analysis.",
