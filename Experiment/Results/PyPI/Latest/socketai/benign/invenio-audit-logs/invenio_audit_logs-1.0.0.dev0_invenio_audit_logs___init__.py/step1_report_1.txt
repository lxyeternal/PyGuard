  "purpose": "The code is a module initialization script for the Invenio-Audit-Logs extension, providing audit logging features for the Invenio framework.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present; imports the 'InvenioAuditLogs' class from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output operations are performed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this is purely a module metadata and import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. Copyright date is set to 2025, which is future-dated but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script contains standard license headers, versioning, and module import statements. It does not include any user input handling, external network communication, or data processing that could introduce security issues. The code appears straightforward, serving as a module setup with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply sets up metadata and imports the necessary class for the extension.",
