  "purpose": "This module provides audit logging features for the Invenio framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.ext', usage of module metadata (__version__, __all__).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; mostly static definitions and import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard license headers, versioning, and imports a local module. There are no dynamic or risky operations, no external data sources, and no functions or executable code that could be exploited. It appears to be a straightforward module initialization file with metadata and import statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python module setup with no evidence of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. It is safe and typical for a package component.",
