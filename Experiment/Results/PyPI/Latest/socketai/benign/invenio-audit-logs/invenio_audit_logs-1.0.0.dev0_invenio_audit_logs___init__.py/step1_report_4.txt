{
  "purpose": "Provide audit logging features for the Invenio framework.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .ext module, and module metadata such as __version__ and __all__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points to untrusted data or external systems are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only initializes and exports components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code detected. The version indicates development status, but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup with standard licensing and versioning information. It imports a local extension and defines export variables. No user input handling, external data reading, or potentially dangerous functions are present. The only external influence is the import statement, which depends on the local package structure. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module initialization for the Invenio framework extension. It contains no malicious code, security issues, or suspicious behavior. The overall security risk is negligible.",
