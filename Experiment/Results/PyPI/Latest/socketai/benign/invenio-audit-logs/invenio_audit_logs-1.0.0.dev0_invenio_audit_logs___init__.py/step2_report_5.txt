  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal Python module that:\n  - Contains license and copyright info (future date 2025).\n  - Defines a version string.\n  - Imports a class `InvenioAuditLogs` from a local module `.ext`.\n  - Sets `__all__` to expose `__version__` and `InvenioAuditLogs`.\n- No data processing, user input, external network calls, or dynamic code.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or security-sensitive operations.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All conclude that the code is a straightforward, standard module setup.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation.\n- No data flow from untrusted sources or external systems.\n- All assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0.\n- Confidence is perfect (1) in all cases.\n\n**Logical consistency:**\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- The only potential concern is the copyright date set to 2025, which is future-dated but not malicious.\n- The import of a local module `.ext` is standard for a package extension.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- No actual code execution, data handling, or network activity is present.\n- No signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.\n- The code is a typical package initialization script.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations and Justifications:\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: **0** is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n  - Obfuscated: **0**; code is clear and straightforward.\n  - Security Risk: **0**; no security issues or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n- **Risk Score:**\n  - The reports assign a risk score of 0, which is justified given the absence of security concerns.\n\n- **Additional considerations:**\n  - The future-dated copyright (2025) is unusual but not harmful.\n  - The import from `.ext` depends on local package structure; no external threat implied.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nBased on the provided code and reports, **the scores are appropriate**. The code is benign, standard package setup, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese align with the reports and the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes needed.\n- The code is safe, with no security issues or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical, safe module initialization script with no security risks or malware.",
