  "purpose": "Provide audit logging features for the Invenio framework as part of the Invenio-Audit-Logs package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module (.ext).",
  "sinks": "None present in the code; no untrusted data handling or external output is shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is primarily defining metadata and importing a module.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious functions. The license and copyright statements are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module file for a Python package. It contains licensing information, a docstring describing its purpose, and an import statement for a local extension module. No input/output operations, network calls, or data handling are present. The code appears typical for a package initialization script, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package module with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It primarily serves to provide audit logging features by importing a local extension. No anomalies, malware, or security concerns are present.",
