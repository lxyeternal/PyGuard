{
  "purpose": "Module providing audit logging features for Invenio.",
  "sources": "Import from local module '.ext', version string assignment, license headers, and metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static code with no external input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static import and variable assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard structure and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module setup with license headers, version info, import statements, and export definitions. It contains no dynamic code execution, network communication, or data handling. The import from '.ext' is typical for package extensions. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The future-dated copyright (2025) is unusual but not malicious. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate no security risks or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initialization script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
