  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input or sensitive data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, defines version information, and specifies what is exported. There are no external data sources, user inputs, or security-critical operations. The content appears to be standard module setup code without any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module definition for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
