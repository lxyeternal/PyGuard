  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of audit logging with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on external object trustworthiness. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting external dependency considerations."
