  "purpose": "This module provides audit logging features for the Invenio framework, initializing configuration, services, and resources related to audit logs.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration variables from the 'config' module and Flask app configuration via 'app.config'. It also reads class attributes from 'config'.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'app.config.setdefault' to set configuration values; instantiates 'AuditLogService' and 'AuditLogResource' objects with configurations. No untrusted data sinks or network actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Configuration variables are read from the 'config' module and 'app.config' (sources) and are used to initialize service and resource objects (sinks). No data flows to external systems or files.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code follows standard pattern for Flask extensions. No obfuscation or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an extension for Flask, setting configuration parameters and creating service and resource objects for audit logging. It uses well-known patterns without external network calls or suspicious data handling. The use of 'setdefault' is safe and standard. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Flask extension setup for audit logging, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
