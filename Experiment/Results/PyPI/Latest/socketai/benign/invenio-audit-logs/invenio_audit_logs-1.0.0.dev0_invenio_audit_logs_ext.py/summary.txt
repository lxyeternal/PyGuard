  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing a typical Flask extension for audit logging without any malicious or obfuscated components. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate at 0. The overall security risk score is 0.1, reflecting very low risk due to configuration handling, which is standard and safe."
