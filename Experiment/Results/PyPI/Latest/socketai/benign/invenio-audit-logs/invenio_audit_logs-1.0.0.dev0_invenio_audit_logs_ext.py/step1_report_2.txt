{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Flask extension for Invenio-Audit-Logs, initializing configuration, services, and resources for audit logging.",
  "sources": "Configuration settings from the 'config' module; app object during extension initialization; environment variables indirectly via app.config.",
  "sinks": "Potentially insecure configuration values set in app.config; service and resource initialization points; app.extensions storage.",
  "flows": "Config values are loaded from the 'config' module into app.config; services are initialized with these configs; resources are created with services and configs; extension is registered in app.extensions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. The code follows typical Flask extension patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Flask extension setup for audit logging, initializing configuration, services, and resources with no apparent malicious behavior. The use of 'config' module suggests external configuration management, with no evident malicious data handling or network activity. The code does not include any suspicious operations, data leaks, or malicious payloads. It appears to be a legitimate implementation consistent with open-source extension design.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Flask extension initialization module for Invenio-Audit-Logs with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs configuration and resource setup in a conventional manner, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
