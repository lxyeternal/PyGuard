  "purpose": "Provide audit logging features for Invenio, a framework for digital repositories.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.config, .resources, .services). Configuration settings from config module.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data, no network or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from config module to app.config, service and resource objects are initialized with configuration and used within the app context.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code appears standard for Flask extension initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Flask extension by importing configuration, resources, and services modules. It sets configuration parameters starting with 'AUDIT_LOGS_' into the Flask app configuration. It creates service and resource objects with the given configuration, associating them with the Flask app. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks are present. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are found; all components appear to be standard for an extension module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Flask extension setup for audit logging, with no suspicious or malicious activity detected. It appears safe and intended for legitimate logging purposes.",
