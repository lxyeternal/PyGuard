{
  "purpose": "Provides audit logging features for the Invenio framework as a Flask extension.",
  "sources": "Configuration from local 'config' module and Flask app.config",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or network activity observed",
  "flows": "Reads configuration, initializes service and resource objects with these configurations",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Flask extension setup for Invenio-Audit-Logs, involving configuration loading, service and resource initialization, and registration within the Flask app. It does not perform any network calls, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution. The pattern is straightforward and aligns with typical extension patterns. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident, and the code is clear and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing a typical Flask extension for audit logging without any malicious or obfuscated components. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate at 0. The overall security risk score is 0.1, reflecting very low risk due to configuration handling, which is standard and safe.",
