  "purpose": "Minimal setup script for the Python package 'Invenio-Audit-Logs', providing package configuration and distribution.",
  "sources": "Imports 'setuptools' module; calls setup() with no arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, user input, network operations, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'setuptools' -> call to setup() -> package configuration; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year is set to 2025, which is in the future relative to the typical data cutoff; this is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated code. The only anomaly is the future copyright date, which is likely a typo or placeholder. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores. The confidence in these assessments is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or security issues. The only notable anomaly is the future copyright date, which does not impact security. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
