{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, specifically for Invenio-Audit-Logs, intended to facilitate package installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the file itself, importing setuptools, and executing setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; setup() is used for package configuration only",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink that involve untrusted data; the script executes setup() with static parameters",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package setup script with standard import and function call",
  "analysis": "The script is a minimal setup file with licensing comments, a docstring describing its purpose, and a single call to setuptools.setup(). It contains no user input handling, no network operations, and no sensitive data processing. The presence of a copyright date set to 2025 appears inconsistent with the data cutoff but is not malicious. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It merely facilitates package installation and does not perform any unsafe or suspicious actions.",
