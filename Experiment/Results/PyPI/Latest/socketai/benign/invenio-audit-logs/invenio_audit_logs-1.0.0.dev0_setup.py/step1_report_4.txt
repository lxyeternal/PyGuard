  "purpose": "This module provides audit logging features for the Invenio project, primarily for audit trail recording.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from setuptools import setup'",
  "sinks": "The 'setup()' function call, which is standard for Python package setup scripts",
  "flows": "The import provides setup functionality; 'setup()' is called immediately after import, initiating package setup",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a license comment, a docstring, an import, and a function call. No user input handling, no data transmission, no hardcoded secrets. The setup() call is typical for packaging and does not perform any malicious activity. The copyright date is in the future, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious code or security issues detected. The only anomaly is the future copyright date, which is likely a typo or misconfiguration. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
