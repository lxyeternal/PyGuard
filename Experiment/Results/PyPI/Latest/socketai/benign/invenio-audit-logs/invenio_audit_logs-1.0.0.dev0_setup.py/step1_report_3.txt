  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Invenio-Audit-Logs package, primarily for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata and setup parameters from the 'setup()' function call.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is standard setup script with a copyright notice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python setup script using setuptools to configure package installation. It contains only imports, a copyright notice, license info, and a single setup() call. No user input, data reading, or external data processing occurs. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The script's purpose is purely to facilitate package installation. The copyright year is 2025, which is in the future relative to the training data but not inherently suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. It contains no sensitive data, no external data flows, and no suspicious patterns. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate.",
