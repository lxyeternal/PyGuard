{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the Invenio-Audit-Logs Python package, used for installing and distributing the package.",
  "sources": "Reads the setup() function from setuptools, which is used to initiate package installation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs are processed; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the script merely calls setup().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. The copyright date is in the future (2025), but this is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard setup script for a Python package. It imports setuptools and calls setup() with no arguments. The script does not process user input, handle external data, or perform any network or file operations. The presence of a future copyright date is likely a typo or placeholder, but does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
