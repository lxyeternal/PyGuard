  "purpose": "Define permission policies for audit logs in the Invenio framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from invenio_administration.generators, invenio_records_permissions.generators, invenio_records_permissions.policies, and local generators.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data flows; permission attributes are static lists.",
  "flows": "The code sets static permission lists; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a permission policy class for audit logs, specifying access controls using imported permission generator classes. It assigns permissions for search, create, read, update, and delete actions, with some actions disabled. The code appears standard and adheres to typical permission policy patterns in the Invenio framework. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, data leakage, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard permission policy definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and intended for access control management within the Invenio framework.",
