  "purpose": "Define permission policies for audit logs, assigning specific permission generators to actions such as search, create, read, update, and delete.",
  "sources": "Imports from invenio_administration.generators, invenio_records_permissions.generators, invenio_records_permissions.policies, and local generators.CurrentUser.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of permission generator lists to class attributes (can_search, can_create, can_read, can_update, can_delete). No untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Class attribute assignments linking permission generators to actions, with static lists defining permissions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and uses standard permission patterns. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a permission policy class inheriting from a base class, assigning permission generators to various actions. It imports standard modules and local generators. The permission assignments are static and straightforward, with some actions disabled. No dynamic data flow, external input handling, obfuscation, or malicious code present. The code is typical for permission management in a web application framework, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard permission policy configuration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No further action or modification is necessary.",
