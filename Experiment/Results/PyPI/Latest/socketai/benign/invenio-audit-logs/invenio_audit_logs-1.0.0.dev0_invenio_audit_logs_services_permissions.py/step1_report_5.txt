  "purpose": "Define permission policies for audit logs in the Invenio system",
  "sources": "Imports from invenio_administration, invenio_records_permissions, and local generators",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks",
  "flows": "Permissions assigned via class attributes based on imported permission generators",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior; standard permission policy code",
  "analysis": "The code sets permission policies for auditing logs using well-known permission generators. It restricts update and delete operations, which is typical for audit logs. The imports and class definitions appear standard and do not include any dynamic code execution or malicious patterns. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, legitimate permission policy definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
