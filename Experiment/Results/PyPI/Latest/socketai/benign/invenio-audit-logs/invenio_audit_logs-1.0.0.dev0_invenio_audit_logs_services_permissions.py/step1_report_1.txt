  "purpose": "Define permission policies for audit logs in the Invenio framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from invenio_administration, invenio_records_permissions, and local generators.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; permission assignments are static.",
  "flows": "Permission classes and attributes set static permission rules; no dynamic data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior. Use of licensing comments and standard permission pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a permission policy class inheriting from a base policy. It assigns specific permission generators to actions like search, create, read, update, and delete. All permission rules are static and straightforward, with no dynamic evaluation or external data handling. The imported modules and class structure are typical for permission management in a web framework. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard permission policies for audit logs with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, straightforward permission setup for a larger application.",
