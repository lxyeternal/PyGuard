  "purpose": "Static configuration for audit logs, defining facets, sorting options, and search parameters.",
  "sources": "Import of TermsFacet from a third-party library; static dictionary definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network calls, or data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Static data definitions without dynamic data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a future year '2025' in the copyright, likely a placeholder or typo.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward static configuration with no dynamic execution, user input, or malicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. The only minor anomaly is the future date, which does not impact security. Malware score is correctly 0; obfuscation score is 0; security risk score is 0.1, justified as a minimal configuration risk due to the placeholder date. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign static configuration with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor date anomaly is not a security concern. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly 0, and the security risk is minimal. The code can be considered safe for use.",
