{
  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Invenio audit logs, defining facets, sorting options, and search parameters.",
  "sources": "Static dictionary definitions and imported class 'TermsFacet' from a third-party library.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external network calls, or data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; configuration data is static and used internally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated content detected. The code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely configuration for search and facet settings, importing a class from a library without executing any dynamic or malicious code. No user input handling, no network operations, no code execution, and no suspicious patterns are present. The structure is typical for setting up search parameters, and there are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard configuration code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines static configurations for audit log facets and sorting options. There is no malicious behavior or supply chain attack present.",
