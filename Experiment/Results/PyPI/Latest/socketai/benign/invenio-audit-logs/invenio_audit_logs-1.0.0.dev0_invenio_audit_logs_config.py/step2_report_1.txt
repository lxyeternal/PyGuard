  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its context, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is static configuration data, importing a class from a third-party library.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, network calls, or data sinks are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The copyright date is set to 2025, which is in the future, but this is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: static configuration for search, facets, and sorting.\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n- The logic is straightforward and well-structured.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The only minor point is the copyright year \"2025,\" which might be a typo or placeholder, but it doesn't impact security.\n- No other flaws or malicious patterns are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware=0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1), justified by the static nature of the code.\n- Confidence is high (1), given the straightforward analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign high risk; the highest is 0.1, which is reasonable.\n- The code is purely configuration, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n\n### Malware and obfuscated scores:\n- Both are correctly set to 0, given the absence of malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports correctly assume no malicious intent based on static configuration.\n- The presence of a future date (2025) is not suspicious in this context.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to potential future date or placeholder comment, but not a security concern)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent.** The code is standard configuration with no security risks or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimated Score |\n|-----------------|------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                      |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1                    |\n\nThis reflects a benign, straightforward configuration module with no security issues.",
