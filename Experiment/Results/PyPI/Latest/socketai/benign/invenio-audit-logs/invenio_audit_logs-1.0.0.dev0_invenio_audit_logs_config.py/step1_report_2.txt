  "purpose": "Configuration settings for the invenio-audit-logs system, defining facets, sorting options, and query parameters.",
  "sources": "Static configuration data, including facet definitions, sort options, and a search dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks or untrusted data output points; the code primarily sets configuration parameters.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code does not process untrusted input data or include data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains static configuration data for search and facet options, utilizing imported classes for defining facets. It does not perform any input/output operations, network communications, or execute dynamic code. The presence of a copyright date '2025' is likely a typo but not malicious. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration module for the larger system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration module with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely defines static parameters for an audit logging system.",
