  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Invenio audit logs, including search parameters, facets, and sorting options.",
  "sources": "Import statement for TermsFacet from invenio_records_resources.services.records.facets",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or user input",
  "flows": "Configuration data flow, primarily static setup without dynamic or external data input",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; no obfuscated code or malicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code defines static configuration dictionaries for search, facets, and sorting options. It imports a class used for setting up facets but does not execute any untrusted input or network operations. There are no dynamic data flows, user input handling, or insecure coding practices observed. The presence of a copyright notice from 2025 is unusual but not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward configuration without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration module for audit log management, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
