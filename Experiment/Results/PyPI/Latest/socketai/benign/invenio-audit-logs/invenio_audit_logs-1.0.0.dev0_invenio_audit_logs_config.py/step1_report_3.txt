{
  "purpose": "Configuration setup for the invenio-audit-logs module, defining search parameters, facets, and sort options for audit logs.",
  "sources": "Static configuration dictionaries and import statements; no user input or external data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or outputted; primarily static configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; configurations are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code includes a comment referencing a future user addition, but this is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static configuration dictionaries for search parameters, facets, and sorting options. It imports a class for facets from a third-party library and defines several dictionaries with fixed string values and class instances. The only notable aspect is the placeholder comment indicating future user-related data addition, which is harmless. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns or embedded code. The copyright date is set to 2025, likely a placeholder or future date but not inherently suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign configuration code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is straightforward and only sets up static parameters for search functionalities within a larger application context.",
