  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it against the provided code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is static configuration for audit logs, defining facets, sorting options, and search parameters.\n- It imports a class `TermsFacet` from a third-party library.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input handling, network calls, or data processing.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The copyright date is set to 2025, which is unusual but likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies that this is configuration code.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No untrusted data or data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate. No malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 (acceptable, minimal configuration risk)  \n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly states static configuration.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No external data or dynamic code.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; notes the '2025' date as likely a typo.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate, straightforward configuration.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly describes static setup.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Static configuration, no dynamic data.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; comment about future user data is benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report is correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Static configuration.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; standard license comment.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Static setup.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; notes the unusual copyright date.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 (minimal, just configuration)\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of all reports:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static configuration with no malicious intent.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- The security risk scores are very low (0 or 0.1), which is reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0.05** (since it's just configuration, very low risk)\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious activity, no code execution, no external data handling.  \n- The only minor concern is the future year '2025' in the copyright, which is likely a typo or placeholder, not a security issue.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The scores assigned are reasonable. The code is benign configuration code with no security risks or malware.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep the scores as they are, or set the overall security risk to **0** for clarity.  \n- No further action needed.",
