  "purpose": "Configuration setup for the invenio-audit-logs system, defining search parameters, facets, and sort options.",
  "sources": "Import of TermsFacet from invenio_records_resources.services.records.facets.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink points that handle untrusted data or external output; configuration data is static.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from definitions to the audit logs system but does not involve untrusted input or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures detected. The code primarily defines static configuration parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class for facets, sets up static dictionaries for search, facets, and sorting options. There are no dynamic inputs, no external data processing, and no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The license comment is standard, and the code appears to serve as configuration. No code injections, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration script for audit log settings. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks. It appears safe and intended for its purpose.",
