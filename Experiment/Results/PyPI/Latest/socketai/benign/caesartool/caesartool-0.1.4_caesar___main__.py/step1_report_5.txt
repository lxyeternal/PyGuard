{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes the main function from the caesar.cli module, likely intended to run a command-line interface (CLI) for a Caesar cipher tool.",
  "sources": "The import statement from caesar.cli import main indicates the source of execution logic; no external input reading in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "The main() function call could be a sink if it performs untrusted operations, but based solely on this code, no direct sink is evident.",
  "flows": "The code flows from import to execution of main(), with no additional data manipulation or flow control shown.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code patterns, or hidden behaviors visible in this minimal snippet.",
  "analysis": "This minimal code imports a main function from an external module and executes it within the standard Python script entry point. No input handling, data processing, or other potentially risky behaviors are present. The code appears to be a straightforward CLI launcher.",
  "conclusion": "There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in this code snippet. It simply runs a main function from an imported module, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
