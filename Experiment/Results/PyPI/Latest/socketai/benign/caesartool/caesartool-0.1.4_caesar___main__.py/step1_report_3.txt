{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes the main function from the caesar.cli module, likely to run a command-line interface for a Caesar cipher tool.",
  "sources": "Import statement from caesar.cli import main",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing; code simply calls main()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a straightforward import and invocation of main(). It does not process or handle any data directly, nor does it contain any suspicious code or external network activity. The import and function call are standard practices for CLI applications.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple entry point for a CLI application, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, safe implementation.",
