  "sinks": "Execution of caesar.cli.main() function",
  "flows": "Program start triggers caesar.cli.main() execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI launcher, importing and executing main() from an external module. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The security implications depend entirely on caesar.cli.main(), which is outside the scope of this snippet. The code itself is benign and standard for CLI applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Security and malware risks are minimal and depend on the external main() implementation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
