  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a minimal CLI entry point, importing and executing `main()` from `caesar.cli`.\n- No direct input/output, secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The actual behavior and potential security issues depend entirely on the implementation of `caesar.cli.main()`, which is not provided.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risks, consistent with the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code as provided is correct and unaltered.\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n- The logic and flow are straightforward and standard.\n\n### Flaws or errors:\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The reports correctly identify that security concerns depend on the imported `main()` function, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code in this snippet.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the clean, minimal code.\n- The security risk scores are very low (0.1 or 0), which is reasonable given the minimal code and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code only delegates execution to an external function, and no suspicious constructs are present, high risk scores are unwarranted.\n- The only caveat is that if `caesar.cli.main()` contains malicious code, the overall risk could be higher, but this cannot be inferred from this snippet alone.\n\n### Potential assumptions:\n- No assumptions about malicious behavior are justified based solely on this code.\n- The reports correctly avoid speculation and focus on the code's structure.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal risk, standard CLI launcher)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a typical CLI entry point, safe and straightforward. The security posture depends on the contents of `caesar.cli.main()`, but from this snippet alone, there are no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n**If I were to assign my own scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the minimal nature of the code and the absence of any suspicious patterns.",
