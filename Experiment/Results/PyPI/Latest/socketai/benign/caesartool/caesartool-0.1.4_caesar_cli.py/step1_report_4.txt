  "purpose": "CLI tool for encrypting or decrypting messages using a Caesar cipher.",
  "sources": "User input from command line arguments: 'sentence' and 'key'.",
  "sinks": "Output via print statements; no direct data leaks or external connections.",
  "flows": "User inputs 'sentence' and 'key' -> process_message called with mode -> output printed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; no environment variables or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper around a cipher function, handling user input, validation, and output. It correctly requires either encryption or decryption flags and passes inputs to 'process_message'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The code does not perform any network activity, system modifications, or access sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign command-line utility for Caesar cipher operations with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
