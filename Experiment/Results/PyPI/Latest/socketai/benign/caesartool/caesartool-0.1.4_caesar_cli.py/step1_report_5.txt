  "purpose": "CLI tool for encrypting or decrypting messages using a Caesar cipher.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from command-line arguments: 'sentence' and 'key'.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the encrypted or decrypted message via print().",
  "flows": "User provides input arguments -> process_message() is called with mode -> result printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns, no unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface for a Caesar cipher. It takes user input via command-line arguments and calls an imported function 'process_message' with these inputs. It includes validation to ensure encryption or decryption mode is specified. The logic is standard for a command-line utility and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs. There are no network calls, file manipulations, or other risky operations. The use of 'argparse' and the modular approach with 'process_message' suggest typical usage without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI utility for Caesar cipher operations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
