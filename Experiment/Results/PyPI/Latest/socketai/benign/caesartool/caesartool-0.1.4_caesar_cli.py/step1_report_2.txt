  "purpose": "CLI utility for encrypting or decrypting messages using a Caesar cipher.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments ('sentence' and 'key').",
  "sinks": "Output to the console via print statements.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments flows through process_message function, with mode set by user flags, then printed to console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports argparse for command-line parsing and a local module 'cipher' for processing messages. It validates user input to ensure either encryption or decryption mode is selected, then calls process_message accordingly, outputting results. No untrusted data flows into insecure sinks or external systems. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward CLI wrapper for a Caesar cipher implementation. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code performs input validation and delegates core logic to an external function without executing any unsafe operations.",
