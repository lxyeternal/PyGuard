  "purpose": "A CLI utility for encrypting or decrypting messages using a Caesar cipher, delegating core logic to an external process_message function.",
  "sources": "User input for sentence and key, command-line flags for mode (-e or -d).",
  "sinks": "Output via print statements after processing the message.",
  "flows": "Input data (sentence, key, mode flags) -> process_message function -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward input validation and delegation. No suspicious code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI wrapper that takes user input, validates mode flags, and calls an external function to process the message. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The security and malware assessment depends on process_message, which is not shown; however, based on this code alone, there are no signs of malicious behavior. The input validation is basic but sufficient for this context. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of this snippet. Given the lack of suspicious patterns or risky operations, the overall security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI wrapper for Caesar cipher operations with no malicious or obfuscated code detected. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, reflecting the simplicity and safety of this implementation. The main concern would be the implementation of process_message, but from this snippet alone, no issues are evident.",
