{
  "purpose": "Provide a command-line interface for encrypting or decrypting messages using a Caesar cipher.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from command-line arguments: 'sentence' (string), 'key' (int), and mode flags ('-e'/'-d').",
  "sinks": "Outputs encrypted or decrypted message via print(). No other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "User input is taken from command-line arguments, passed to process_message() with mode, and results are printed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard command-line argument parsing. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an argument parser to accept a sentence and a key, with optional flags for encryption or decryption. It verifies that either -e or -d is specified before proceeding. The main function calls process_message() with provided arguments and prints the result. The code appears to be a typical CLI wrapper around a cipher function, with no suspicious logic, data leaks, or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool for Caesar cipher operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment. It functions as intended for its purpose.",
