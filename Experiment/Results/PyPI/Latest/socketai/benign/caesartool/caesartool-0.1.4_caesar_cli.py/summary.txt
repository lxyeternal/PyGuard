  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI wrapper for Caesar cipher operations with no malicious or obfuscated code detected. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, reflecting the simplicity and safety of this implementation. The main concern would be the implementation of process_message, but from this snippet alone, no issues are evident."
