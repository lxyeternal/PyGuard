  "purpose": "CLI tool for encrypting or decrypting a message using the Caesar cipher.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from command-line arguments: 'sentence' and 'key'.",
  "sinks": "Outputs encrypted or decrypted message via print(). No other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "User input -> process_message function -> output via print().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No malicious code or obfuscated sections are present. The process_message function is imported but its implementation is not shown, so potential issues depend on that function.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper for a Caesar cipher encryption/decryption. It securely handles user input via command-line arguments, checks for necessary flags, and calls an external function for processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Without the implementation of 'process_message', we cannot fully evaluate its safety, but based on this code alone, no malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple CLI utility for Caesar cipher operations with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks evident from the provided fragment.",
