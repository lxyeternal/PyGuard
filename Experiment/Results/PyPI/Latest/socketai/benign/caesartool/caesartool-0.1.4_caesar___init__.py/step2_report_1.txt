  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is either empty or contains only comments serving as placeholders for package variables or imports.\n   - There are no executable statements, data flows, or code logic in any of the files.\n   - No sources, sinks, or data flows are present, which aligns with the code's purpose as a boilerplate or template.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their descriptions.\n   - They correctly identify the files as benign placeholders with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware detected)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the content.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all files are empty placeholders with no code, data, or behavior, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The current scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - No malicious activity or code is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the files as benign placeholders.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made without evidence.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nGiven the nature of these files, they pose no security threat. They are standard placeholder files with no executable code, data flows, or malicious intent.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, non-executable, placeholder status of the files.",
