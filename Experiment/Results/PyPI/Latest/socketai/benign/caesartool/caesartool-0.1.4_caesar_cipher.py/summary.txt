  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a Caesar cipher with no malicious intent. The only minor issue is the use of 'exit()' for input validation failure, which could be improved by raising exceptions for robustness. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk, and the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
