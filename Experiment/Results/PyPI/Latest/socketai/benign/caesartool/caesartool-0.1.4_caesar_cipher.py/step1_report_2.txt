{
  "purpose": "The function encrypts or decrypts a message based on a Caesar cipher method.",
  "sources": "The function reads input data from the 'sentence' parameter and the 'key' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The function does not appear to write untrusted data to external systems or leak data outside its scope.",
  "flows": "Input 'sentence' and 'key' are processed to produce an encrypted or decrypted string; no external flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'exit()' on invalid key, which terminates the program abruptly; no other suspicious behavior or hardcoded secrets identified.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard Caesar cipher with a mode switch for encrypt/decrypt. It verifies 'key' is an integer; if not, it terminates. It processes each character, shifting alphabetic characters accordingly, and preserves non-alphabetic characters. There are no external data transmissions, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs. The abrupt exit on invalid input could be disruptive but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward encryption/decryption without malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present; however, the use of 'exit()' may cause unintended termination in production but is not harmful malicious code.",
