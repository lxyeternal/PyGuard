  "purpose": "Encrypt or decrypt a message using a simple Caesar cipher based on the provided key and mode.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: sentence (string), key (int), mode (string).",
  "sinks": "Returns the encrypted/decrypted string; no external data sinks or output beyond the function.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed; the function applies a shift to alphabetic characters based on the key and mode, returning the modified string.",
  "anomalies": "Uses print() and exit() for error handling instead of exceptions, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The function performs a basic Caesar cipher encryption/decryption, a common and straightforward algorithm. It checks if the key is an integer, then processes each character, shifting alphabetic characters accordingly. Non-alphabetic characters are retained unchanged. Error handling via print() and exit() is unconventional but not harmful. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a simple cipher without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks. The code structure and logic are straightforward, with no anomalies indicating malicious activity.",
