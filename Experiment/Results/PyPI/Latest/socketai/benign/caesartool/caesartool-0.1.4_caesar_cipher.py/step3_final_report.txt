  "purpose": "Implement a Caesar cipher for encrypting or decrypting messages based on a provided key.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'sentence' and 'key'; the 'mode' parameter determines operation.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data flows, network activity, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'sentence' and 'key' are processed; alphabetic characters are shifted based on 'key' and 'mode'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exit()' for input validation failure; no malicious code or obfuscation; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a basic Caesar cipher with correct logic for shifting alphabetic characters. It checks if 'key' is an integer; if not, it prints an error message and terminates abruptly via 'exit()'. Non-alphabetic characters are preserved. No external data flows, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The use of 'exit()' is unconventional but not malicious; it could cause stability issues but does not introduce security vulnerabilities. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The code is transparent and simple, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1 due to the abrupt termination, which could disrupt program flow but is not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a Caesar cipher with no malicious intent. The only minor issue is the use of 'exit()' for input validation failure, which could be improved by raising exceptions for robustness. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk, and the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
