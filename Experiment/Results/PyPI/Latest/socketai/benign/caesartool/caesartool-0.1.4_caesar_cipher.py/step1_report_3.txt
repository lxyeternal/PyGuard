{
  "purpose": "The function processes a message by encrypting or decrypting it using a Caesar cipher.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'sentence' (message to process), 'key' (encryption/decryption shift), 'mode' (operation mode).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain external data sinks; it processes inputs locally and returns a result.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through the function to produce an encrypted or decrypted string, with no external or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'exit()' on invalid key input can terminate the program abruptly; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The function validates that 'key' is an integer, then applies a Caesar cipher shift to alphabetic characters based on the mode ('encrypt' or 'decrypt'). Non-alphabetic characters are preserved as-is. The use of 'exit()' on invalid input may disrupt normal operation but does not indicate malicious intent. The logic is standard for a Caesar cipher implementation with no suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leakage. No external communications, hidden behaviors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic Caesar cipher encryption/decryption without malicious behavior. The abrupt termination on invalid key input is a minor concern but not malicious. Overall, the code is benign.",
