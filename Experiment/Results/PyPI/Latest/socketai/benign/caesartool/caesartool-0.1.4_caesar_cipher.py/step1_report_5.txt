{
  "purpose": "The function performs Caesar cipher encryption or decryption on a given message based on the specified mode.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'sentence', 'key', and 'mode'. The 'sentence' parameter is the message to be processed, 'key' is the shift value, and 'mode' determines whether to encrypt or decrypt.",
  "sinks": "The function outputs the processed message as a string; it does not send data elsewhere or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Input 'sentence' and 'key' are used to produce the output string via character shifting; no external data flow or network activity is present.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'exit()' for error handling instead of raising exceptions; this could be disruptive but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscation or external side effects detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard Caesar cipher encryption/decryption. It checks if 'key' is an integer, then processes each character. Alphabetic characters are shifted accordingly, while non-alphabetic characters are left unchanged. The use of 'exit()' on invalid key is a concern for stability but not malicious. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. No external data sources or sinks are involved, and the logic is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple Caesar cipher implementation with no malicious intent. The only minor concern is its abrupt termination on invalid input, which is unrelated to security but may affect usability. Overall, it poses no security threat or malware risk.",
