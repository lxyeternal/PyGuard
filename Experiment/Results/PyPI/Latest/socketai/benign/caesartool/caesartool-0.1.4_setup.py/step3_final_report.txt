  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'caesartool', defining package metadata and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata; entry point 'caesar.cli:main'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or code execution.",
  "flows": "Static data read from file; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The entry point references a CLI main function, which is standard. No dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores are consistent with the code content and context.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, benign packaging configuration with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
