      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI wrapper for Caesar cipher operations with no malicious or obfuscated code detected. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, reflecting the simplicity and safety of this implementation. The main concern would be the implementation of process_message, but from this snippet alone, no issues are evident."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a Caesar cipher with no malicious intent. The only minor issue is the use of 'exit()' for input validation failure, which could be improved by raising exceptions for robustness. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk, and the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

Security and malware risks are minimal and depend on the external main() implementation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity."
