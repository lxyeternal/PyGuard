  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to convert, replace, and remove emojis based on a predefined dictionary, facilitating emoji manipulation in text.",
  "sources": "Reads input text in methods: replace_string_with_emoji, replace_emojis_with_string, replace_emojis_with_alternatives, remove_emojis.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies input text, but only within the context of emoji replacements; no direct data leaks or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input text flows through various replacement functions, transforming emoji representations between strings and characters, with no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The emoji dictionary is extensive but static; no malicious or maliciously intended code is present. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static emoji dictionary and utility functions for emoji conversion and removal. The methods perform straightforward string replacements and lookups, all based on predefined, hardcoded data. There are no external data sources, no network operations, no code injection, and no suspicious behaviors. The functions operate solely on provided input text, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for emoji processing, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It performs simple, well-understood text manipulations based on a static dictionary, without any external system interactions or secret handling.",
