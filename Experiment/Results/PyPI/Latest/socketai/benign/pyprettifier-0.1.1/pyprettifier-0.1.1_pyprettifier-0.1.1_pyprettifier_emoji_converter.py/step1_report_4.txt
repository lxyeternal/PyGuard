  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for converting between emoji names and characters, replacing emojis in text, and removing emojis.",
  "sources": "Reads input text in various methods, especially in replace_string_with_emoji, replace_emojis_with_string, replace_emojis_with_alternatives, and remove_emojis.",
  "sinks": "Performs string replacements which can modify input text; no external sinks like network or file access present.",
  "flows": "Input text -> string replacement functions -> output text with emojis or emoji tags.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code performs straightforward string replacements without dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. Repetition of emoji mappings (e.g., duplicate ':rocket:' and ':alien:' entries) is observed but benign. No unusual or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static emoji dictionary and utility functions for converting emoji names to characters, replacing emoji tags with emojis, replacing emojis with tags, substituting emojis with custom replacements, and removing emojis. The functions operate via simple string replacements without external dependencies or side effects. No input/output operations, network access, or credential handling is present. The code appears to be a benign utility module for emoji processing, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for emoji handling with no malicious behavior detected. It performs straightforward string manipulations, and there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
