  "purpose": "A utility module for emoji conversions and manipulations, including replacing emoji tags with emojis, emojis with tags, custom replacements, and removal of emojis from text.",
  "sources": "Static emoji dictionary used for lookups and replacements within string processing functions.",
  "sinks": "String replacement operations within in-memory text; no external data or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input text passes through replacement functions where emoji tags or characters are substituted based on the static dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "Duplicate entries for ':rocket:' and ':alien:' in the emoji dictionary, which are benign but suggest minor data inconsistency.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static emoji dictionary and provides multiple static methods for converting, replacing, and removing emojis in text. All operations are in-memory string manipulations with no external dependencies, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The functions perform straightforward lookups and replacements, with no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or external data leaks. The duplicate entries in the dictionary are minor data issues, not security concerns. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static utility for emoji handling with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with its functionality. Overall, it is safe for use in any context, with minimal risk of misuse.",
