  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for converting between emoji names and characters, replacing emojis in strings, and removing emojis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings for replacements and conversions in methods like replace_string_with_emoji, replace_emojis_with_string, replace_emojis_with_alternatives, and remove_emojis.",
  "sinks": "The functions manipulate string data but do not output untrusted data to external systems, networks, or files. No direct sinks indicate malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through replacement methods that convert emoji names to characters, characters to emoji names, or substitute emojis with alternatives. These are in-memory string transformations with no external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The emoji dictionary is extensive but static. The methods perform straightforward string replacements and lookups without obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static dictionary of emoji names and their characters. Multiple static methods perform simple in-memory string replacements: converting emoji names to characters, replacing emojis with their names, substituting emojis with custom alternatives, and removing emojis. The logic is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, external data access, or suspicious patterns. The code does not contain hidden backdoors, external communication, or malicious payloads. All functions operate solely on provided input strings with predictable operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for emoji conversions and manipulations. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. Its purpose is purely to facilitate emoji handling within other applications.",
