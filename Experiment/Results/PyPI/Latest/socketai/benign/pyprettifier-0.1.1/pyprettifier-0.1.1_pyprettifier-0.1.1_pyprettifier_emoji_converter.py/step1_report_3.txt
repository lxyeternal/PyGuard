{
  "purpose": "Provides methods for converting emoji names to emojis, replacing emoji tags in strings with emojis, replacing emojis with tags, replacing emojis with custom alternatives, and removing emojis from text.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in methods: 'emoji_name' in convert; 'text' in replace_string_with_emoji, replace_emojis_with_string, replace_emojis_with_alternatives, remove_emojis; 'replacements' in replace_emojis_with_alternatives.",
  "sinks": "String manipulations that modify 'text' based on emoji replacements, potentially leading to unintended content modifications or data leaks if misused, but no direct untrusted data sources or network calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into string processing functions, with replacement operations transforming the input string; no external network or file I/O involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. No unusual or suspicious code constructs. The emoji dictionary is extensive but static and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static emoji dictionary for name-to-character conversions and includes multiple static methods for various emoji manipulations within text. The functions perform direct string replacements without external data sources or network activity. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. All operations are purely text-based and depend on predefined data structures. No suspicious logic or anomalies identified. The use of static methods and a static dictionary indicates simplicity and clarity, reducing the risk of hidden malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for emoji processing with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It operates purely on string replacements and does not involve external inputs or outputs that could lead to data leakage or malicious activity.",
