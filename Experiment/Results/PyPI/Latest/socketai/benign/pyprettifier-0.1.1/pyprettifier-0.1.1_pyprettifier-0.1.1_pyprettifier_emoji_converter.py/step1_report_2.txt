  "purpose": "Provides functionality to convert, replace, and remove emojis in strings, facilitating emoji handling in text.",
  "sources": "Reads input strings in methods such as replace_string_with_emoji, replace_emojis_with_string, replace_emojis_with_alternatives, and remove_emojis.",
  "sinks": "Processes input strings for replacement or removal of emojis; no output or external data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through multiple replacement functions, converting emoji names to characters, emojis back to names, or replacing emojis with alternatives.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code functions as a straightforward emoji conversion utility. No obfuscation or dynamic execution observed. The emoji dictionary appears extensive but benign. No external network access or data exfiltration routines are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a comprehensive emoji dictionary and provides static methods for converting emoji names to characters, replacing emoji names with emojis in strings, converting emojis back to names, replacing emojis with custom alternatives, and removing emojis from text. The implementation uses standard dictionary lookups and string replacements, with no external dependencies or potentially malicious operations. The reversed dictionaries facilitate bi-directional conversion. The functions operate solely on provided input strings, with no side-effects or external interactions. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks within this module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for emoji handling, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs straightforward text processing tasks without any suspicious or malicious activities.",
