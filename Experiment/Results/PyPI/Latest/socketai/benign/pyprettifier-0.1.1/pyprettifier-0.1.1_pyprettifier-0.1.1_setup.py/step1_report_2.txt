  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for the 'pyprettifier' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, dependencies, and setup parameters from the script.",
  "sinks": "Installation process, potential network calls during dependency installation.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows; the setup process installs dependencies, potentially triggers network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. Use of standard setuptools functions without additional malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata and dependencies. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or suspicious behavior embedded within this setup script. The only notable activity is specifying the 'requests' library as a dependency, which is common for network operations but not inherently malicious. The script is straightforward and adheres to typical Python packaging practices. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
