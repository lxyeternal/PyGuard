{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'pyprettifier' intended for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata such as name, version, description, author, and dependencies from hardcoded strings and lists.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that execute untrusted data, perform network operations, or handle sensitive information directly.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic data flows from sources to sinks; the script primarily defines package configuration and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The script uses standard setuptools setup process without obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python package setup configuration using setuptools. It includes package metadata and a dependency on 'requests', a common HTTP library. There are no dynamic imports, code execution, or network operations within this script. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code is straightforward, structured, and uses standard practices for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a benign and standard package configuration file with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply specifies package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
