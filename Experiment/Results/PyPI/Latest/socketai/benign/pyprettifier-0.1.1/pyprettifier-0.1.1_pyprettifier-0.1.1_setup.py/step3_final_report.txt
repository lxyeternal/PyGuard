  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'pyprettifier' utility, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, author info, dependencies ('requests'), no dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output effects present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with static metadata and dependencies. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements justify these scores. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. The scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate.",
