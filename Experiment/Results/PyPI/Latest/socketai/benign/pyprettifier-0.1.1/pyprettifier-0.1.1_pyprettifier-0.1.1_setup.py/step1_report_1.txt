{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for packaging a Python utility named 'pyprettifier'. It specifies package metadata and dependencies for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads package configuration data (name, version, description, author info, dependencies). It imports setup functions and package list.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include executing code from dependencies or external input, but in this script, no such sink is present.",
  "flows": "The setup function uses static data to define package metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The email address appears to be a generic support contact, not suspicious. No dynamic code execution or external data handling is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package details and dependencies with static values. There are no input reads from untrusted sources, no code execution, no network activity, or suspicious behaviors. The code structure is straightforward and typical for package distribution scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, serving only to package and distribute a Python utility. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected.",
