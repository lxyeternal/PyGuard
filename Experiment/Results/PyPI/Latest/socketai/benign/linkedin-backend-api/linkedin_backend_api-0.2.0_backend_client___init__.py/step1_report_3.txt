{
  "purpose": "To serve as a client package for interacting with the LinkedIn API, providing models and a client class.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.client and .models), and the __all__ list defining exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling, no external data flows, no network connections, and no sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only imports modules and defines an export list without any runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing classes and models from local modules and defining an export list for package API. No external data input, no data manipulation, no network or security-sensitive operations. The structure indicates it is a simple package interface definition. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign package initialization file for a LinkedIn API client, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
