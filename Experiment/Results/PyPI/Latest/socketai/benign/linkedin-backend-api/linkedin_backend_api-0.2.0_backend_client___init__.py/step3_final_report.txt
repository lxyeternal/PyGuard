{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the package initializer for a LinkedIn API client library, importing and exposing relevant classes and models for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class and model definitions from local modules (.client and .models). It does not read untrusted input or external data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code is purely structural.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports classes without processing data or executing runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and standard for a package __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static package initializer that imports classes and models from local modules and defines __all__ for API exposure. It contains no runtime logic, data handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. All reports agree on its benign nature, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and clarity confirm it poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization file with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and justified.",
