{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'linkedin-backend-api', specifying its dependencies and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Input sources are the package configuration parameters such as package name, version, dependencies, author info, and URL.",
  "fires": "Untrusted data could potentially be introduced if the setup parameters are overridden or manipulated, but in this code, data appears static and hardcoded.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the static setup parameters through the setuptools functions for package installation; there are no untrusted input flows.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious dynamic behaviors; all code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup, defines a package with specific dependencies, and provides metadata. No user input or dynamic code execution is present. Dependencies are standard packages (aiohttp, pydantic). No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code follows typical setup conventions and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate, standard, and free from malicious behavior. It solely specifies package configuration and dependencies without any suspicious or malicious code components.",
