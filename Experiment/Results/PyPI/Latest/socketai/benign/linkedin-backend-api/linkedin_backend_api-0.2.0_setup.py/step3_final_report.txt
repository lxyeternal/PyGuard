  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a project with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters: name, version, packages, install_requires, python_requires, description, author, author_email, url.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools, defining static package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code, user input, external data fetching, or malicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The dependencies are common packages, and metadata fields are empty but not suspicious. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
