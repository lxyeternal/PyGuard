  "purpose": "Define data models for user preferences, search filters, and related settings using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code only defines classes and default values.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is purely structural with no data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with optional fields and default values.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of Pydantic model definitions for Location, AIFilter, UserBotSettings, LinkedinFilters, UserSearchSettings, User, and UserCreateDTO. It contains no functions, external calls, or data handling beyond model validation. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The models are standard and serve as data schemas for user and search preferences. Given the absence of external interactions, code execution, or suspicious constructs, the code is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard data models with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
