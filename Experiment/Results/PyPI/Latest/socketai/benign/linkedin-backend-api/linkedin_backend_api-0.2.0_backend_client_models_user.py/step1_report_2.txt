{
  "purpose": "Define data models for user and search settings using Pydantic for validation and structure.",
  "sources": "Input data from API requests or external sources to instantiate the models, e.g., user input or database data.",
  "sinks": "Data could potentially be outputted or stored; no direct sinks in the code itself.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into model instantiation; no external untrusted data handling or processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code structures. The code mainly defines data models without executing untrusted code.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes Pydantic to define structured data models with optional and default values. No external data is processed within this code snippet, and no dangerous operations such as system calls, network requests, or code execution are present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or data leakage mechanisms are observed. The models are purely for data validation and organization.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard definition of data models for user settings and filters with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It is a typical implementation for handling structured data in a backend application.",
