  "purpose": "Define data models for user and search settings using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "None (standard library imports, no data input/output code).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output, network communication, or file operations).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow from input to output or untrusted sources).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. Use of Pydantic models appears standard. No suspicious code patterns, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several Pydantic data models for user preferences, search filters, and related settings. All fields are typical data attributes with default values or optional annotations. There are no input/output operations, no data validation beyond data modeling, and no network or system commands. The code appears to be straightforward data schema definitions for a user profile system. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of data models for user settings with no malicious intent or security issues. It functions solely as data structure definitions without external interactions.",
