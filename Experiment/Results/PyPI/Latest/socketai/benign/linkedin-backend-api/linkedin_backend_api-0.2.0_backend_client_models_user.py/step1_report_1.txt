{
  "purpose": "Define data models for user and search settings in a system, likely related to user preferences and filtering options.",
  "sources": "Import statements for typing, pydantic, and datetime; class definitions and default values within those classes.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no use of untrusted input handling, network, file, or environment data manipulation.",
  "flows": "Input data is modeled via pydantic classes but not processed or transmitted within the code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious variable names, or unusual code structures. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines data models using pydantic, specifying user and search preferences with optional fields and default values. No external data sources or sinks are present. No code execution, data handling, or network activities are visible. The code appears purely structural and does not contain any malicious logic or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data models with no malicious behavior or security risks. It solely models user preferences and filters without any suspicious or harmful features.",
