  "purpose": "Define data models for user and search settings using Pydantic for validation and type enforcement.",
  "sources": "Data input through model instantiation, environment variables (not used here), or external API calls (not shown).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data output, external network calls, or sensitive data handling within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from instantiating models with input data, with optional nested models, but no untrusted data flow to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines Pydantic models for user data and settings. There are no functions, external calls, or data processing that could lead to malicious behavior. The models include optional fields and default values but no handling of untrusted data sources or sinks. Overall, the code appears to be standard data schema definitions without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data modeling setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any network operations, file handling, or system modifications. Therefore, it poses no security threat.",
