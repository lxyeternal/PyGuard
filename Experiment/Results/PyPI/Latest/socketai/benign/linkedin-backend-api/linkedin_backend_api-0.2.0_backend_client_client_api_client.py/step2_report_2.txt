  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the evidence for malicious activity, code quality, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a structured async API client, with comprehensive error handling, data validation, and no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (low, considering the code's purpose)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious indicators are present. The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of suspicious activity. The security risk is minimal, given the nature of API client code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard implementation, proper validation, and no malicious signs.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. No signs of malware or obfuscation are detected. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard API client with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no suspicious activity is evident. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with standard error handling and response processing.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard API client implementation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code is present.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the lack of malicious indicators.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher than zero, but still very low, reflecting the nature of the code as a backend API client.\n- **Confidence levels:** High, indicating thorough analysis.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided information.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Security risk:** **0.1–0.2** (very low, typical for such code)\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured API client with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The scores reflect this accurately.",
