  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a structured async API client, sources are API responses and function parameters.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard, with proper error handling, validation, and no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the low risk score aligns with the absence of suspicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar description, focusing on API interactions and data validation.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, dynamic code, or malicious constructs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, secure, and free of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's nature; very low risk.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focus on backend interaction, with standard data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical API client, with no signs of sabotage.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, emphasizing standard API communication.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Secure, legitimate, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard API client functions.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, with no signs of sabotage.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which aligns with the code's nature. No malicious activity or payloads are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0; the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any suspicious behavior, secrets, or malicious patterns, the risk scores should be very low, ideally around 0.1–0.2.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The **malware scores** are justified at 0.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are justified at 0.\n- The **security risk scores** could be slightly lowered from 0.2 to 0.1, reflecting the absence of any concerning factors.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Recommended Value | Justification                                                                 |\n|------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                   | No signs of malicious code or payloads.                                     |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                   | Code is clear, no obfuscation detected.                                       |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1                 | Minimal risk; standard API client with no suspicious activity.             |\n\n**Conclusion:** The overall assessment indicates that the code is a secure, well-structured API client with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores provided are appropriate, and minor adjustments to the risk score could be considered for an even more conservative estimate.",
