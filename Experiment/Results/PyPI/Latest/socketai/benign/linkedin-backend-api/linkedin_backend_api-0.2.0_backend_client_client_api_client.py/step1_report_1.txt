{
  "purpose": "This code provides an asynchronous API client for interacting with a backend service, including user management, vacancy management, and AI-powered features such as prompt conversion, description optimization, and vacancy scoring.",
  "sources": "Input data from API responses, function parameters (prompts, user IDs, vacancy data, message content, settings).",
  "sinks": "API requests sending data (prompts, user info, vacancy data, messages).",
  "flows": "Sources (inputs) flow into API request payloads; responses from API are processed and converted into models; potential untrusted data flows from external API responses or input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected; no obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, or misleading variable names. No suspicious network calls or data exfiltration methods observed; error handling is standard; no evident backdoors or hidden behaviors. The code does not perform any system modifications, nor does it access or leak sensitive system data.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a structured, asynchronous API client using standard Python libraries and Pydantic for data validation. It manages API interactions, error handling, and response processing appropriately. The error classes cover typical HTTP error statuses, and responses are validated and converted to models. No suspicious or malicious code segments, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are apparent. All external interactions appear to be typical API calls, and there are no indications of malicious behavior such as unauthorized data collection, system modification, or covert communication. The usage of external libraries is standard for async HTTP requests and data validation. The logic seems consistent with intended functionality without hidden or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured API client implementation with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attacks. It securely handles responses, errors, and data validation. No suspicious activities or malware patterns are detected.",
