  "purpose": "Define a data model for vacancy postings with validation using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines a data structure without reading external input.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no sinks or data processing functions that handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this code snippet as it only declares a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual constructs, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines a Pydantic model with various optional fields for vacancy data. There are no external inputs processed, no data transformations, and no code execution or network activity. The 'source' field is set to a fixed string 'linkedin', which is benign. Overall, this code solely defines a schema for data validation and does not perform any malicious actions or insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data model definition with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain obfuscation, malware, or suspicious behavior.",
