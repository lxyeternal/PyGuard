{
  "purpose": "Define a data model for a job vacancy using Pydantic's BaseModel for validation.",
  "sources": "Input data from external sources to populate Vacancy instances, particularly fields like job_id, url, and source.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the model is used for data validation and serialization, not for executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs into the Vacancy model, with no apparent processing or output that could be exploited.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward, with standard use of Pydantic and datetime.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic BaseModel subclass with various optional fields for job vacancy data. The only notable fixed value is source='linkedin', which is harmless. No dynamic execution, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. There are no hardcoded credentials, no code injection mechanisms, and no external calls or obfuscated logic. The code is purely a data structure for validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, well-structured data model for job vacancies, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
