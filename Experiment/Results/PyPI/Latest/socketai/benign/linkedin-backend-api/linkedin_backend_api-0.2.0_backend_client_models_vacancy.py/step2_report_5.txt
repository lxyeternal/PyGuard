  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward Pydantic data model with no external data handling, code execution, or suspicious constructs.\n- The code only defines a schema for vacancy data, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks identified.\n- The only fixed value is `source='linkedin'`, which is benign.\n- No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code, or external calls are present.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal or no security risk. Given the code's nature, a score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The third report assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1, which is slightly higher than the others. However, since the code is purely a data schema with no external interactions, this minor increase isn't justified. A score of 0 is more appropriate.\n- The reasoning in all reports is sound, with no assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate; no changes needed.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: a simple, standard data model with no security concerns.",
