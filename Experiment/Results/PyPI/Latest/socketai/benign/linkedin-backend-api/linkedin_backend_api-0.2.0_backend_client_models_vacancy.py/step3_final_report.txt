  "purpose": "Define a data schema for vacancy postings with optional descriptive fields and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines a class structure with static default values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; the code does not process or output data dynamically.",
  "flows": "No data flows or external data handling; it's a static class definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward and clean.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Pydantic model with optional fields and a fixed source value. It contains no dynamic behavior, external data fetching, or malicious code. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The minimal risk scores are justified given the static, declarative nature of the code. Overall, the code poses no security threat and functions solely as a data schema.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data model with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate, and there is no evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
