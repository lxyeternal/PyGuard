  "purpose": "Define a data model for a job vacancy using Pydantic for validation and type enforcement.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data outputs or external interactions that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only declares a data structure without processing or data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The code uses standard Pydantic and Python features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic BaseModel with various optional fields related to a job vacancy. It uses standard Python typing and datetime modules. No dynamic code execution, environment variable usage, or external data fetching is present. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or potentially dangerous behaviors. The code solely models data structure, which is common and benign in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data model definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is typical for API or data processing applications. The code appears safe and free from supply chain or malicious code concerns.",
