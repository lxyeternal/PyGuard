{
  "purpose": "Define a data model for a job vacancy using Pydantic validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from external inputs to instantiate the Vacancy model (e.g., job_id, url, source, and optional fields).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code does not perform actions like network requests, file I/O, or data storage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input sources into the model fields, which are validated but not executed or transmitted within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. The code uses standard data modeling practices without obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic model with various optional and required fields for job vacancies. It imports necessary modules, specifies data types, and includes default values. There are no functions, network operations, or data processing that could introduce security risks. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves solely as a data structure definition for job postings without performing any operations or external interactions. It does not exhibit malware or security risks.",
