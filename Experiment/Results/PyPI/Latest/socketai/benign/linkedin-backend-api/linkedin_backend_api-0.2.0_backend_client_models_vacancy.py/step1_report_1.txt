{
  "purpose": "Define a data model for vacancy postings using Pydantic for validation.",
  "sources": "Input data fields for vacancy information, such as job_id, title, description, etc.",
  "stakes": "No evident untrusted data sinks; the code primarily defines a data structure.",
  "flows": "Data is received via the model fields; no explicit data flows to external sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a Pydantic BaseModel with various optional fields for a job vacancy. It specifies data types, including optional strings and a datetime for created_at. There is a default value for source set to 'linkedin'. The code does not include any input handling, external data fetching, or execution logic. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data model definition with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to serve as a schema for vacancy data storage or validation.",
