  "purpose": "This code defines and exports models related to the LinkedIn API client, including user, vacancy, and notification models.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.ai, .user, .vacancy, .telegram). No external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only imports and declares exports without processing runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, which defines exported symbols. It does not execute any logic, perform data handling, or include any external interactions. No potential attack vectors, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module for model definitions and exports with no malicious intent or security concerns. It serves as a structural part of a larger project, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
