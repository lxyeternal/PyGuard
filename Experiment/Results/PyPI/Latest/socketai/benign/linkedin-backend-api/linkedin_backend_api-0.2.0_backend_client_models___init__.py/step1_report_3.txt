  "purpose": "This code defines models for the LinkedIn API client, including importing various classes related to user, vacancy, and notification data structures.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules (.ai, .user, .vacancy, .telegram)",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data processing, network operations, or untrusted input handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output or between components within this code segment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward module with class imports and exports",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports classes from internal modules and defines the __all__ list for module exports. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or any dynamic behaviors. It appears to be a static module for organizing class exports. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code structure and formatting are normal for a Python package __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module for exposing classes related to a LinkedIn API client. It shows no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
