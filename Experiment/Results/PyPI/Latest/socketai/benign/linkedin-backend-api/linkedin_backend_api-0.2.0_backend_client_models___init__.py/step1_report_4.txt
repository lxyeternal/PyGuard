{
  "purpose": "The code defines and exports models related to a LinkedIn API client, including user, vacancy, notification, and AI-related data models.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.ai, .user, .vacancy, .telegram) and the __all__ list defining exported identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform critical security operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only declares imports and exports without processing or handling data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior, are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements and an __all__ export list. It does not process data, execute dynamic code, or interact with external systems. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms. The code appears to be standard module setup for a Python package, with no suspicious constructs or security risks present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module declaration for a Python package, exporting various models. It shows no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
