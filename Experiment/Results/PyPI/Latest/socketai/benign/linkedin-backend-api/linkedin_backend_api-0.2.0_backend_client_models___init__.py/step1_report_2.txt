  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for a LinkedIn API client, organizing and exposing classes and data models related to users, vacancies, notifications, and AI components.",
  "sources": "The code imports various classes and data structures from local modules (.ai, .user, .vacancy, .telegram).",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks for untrusted data; the code only imports and exports classes without executing or handling data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows are explicitly present; the code only sets up module exports, with no data processing or external input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code constructs, are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical Python module organization.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a simple module that imports classes and functions from local submodules and defines the __all__ attribute to specify public API components. It does not perform any data processing, external calls, or contain any executable logic. The absence of dynamic code, input handling, or external network interactions suggests no malicious intent. All imported modules appear to be domain-relevant data models and utility classes, with no indication of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply organizes and exposes classes for a LinkedIn API client, with no suspicious or harmful code present.",
