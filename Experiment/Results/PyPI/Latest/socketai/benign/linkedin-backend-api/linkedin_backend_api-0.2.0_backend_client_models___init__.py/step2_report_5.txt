  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module that imports classes from internal modules and sets `__all__` for public API exposure.\n- There are no signs of data processing, external data sinks, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The code appears to be a typical `__init__.py` or module export file for a Python package.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The consistent zero scores across reports seem reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n**Risk Scores:**\n- All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The purpose and analysis in each report confirm that there are no security concerns.\n\n**Potential Issues or Misjudgments:**\n- Since the code is purely import/export, the main concern could be whether any imported modules could be malicious. However, the reports specify that these are internal modules (.ai, .user, .vacancy, .telegram) that seem domain-specific and benign.\n- No evidence suggests that any of these modules contain malicious code or hidden behaviors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard, safe module setup for exposing classes in a Python package. There are no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security threats based on the provided snippet and analysis.",
