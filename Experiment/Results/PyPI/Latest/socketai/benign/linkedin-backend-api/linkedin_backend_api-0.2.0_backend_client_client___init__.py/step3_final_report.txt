  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports the ApiClient class from a local api_client module and exposes it via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import statement from the local module .api_client.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "The source is the import of ApiClient; there are no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup with a docstring, an import statement, and an __all__ declaration. It does not process data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
