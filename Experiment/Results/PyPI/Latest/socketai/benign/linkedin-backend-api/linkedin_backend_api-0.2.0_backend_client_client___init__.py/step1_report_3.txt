  "purpose": "This module provides access to the LinkedIn API client by importing the ApiClient class.",
  "sources": "Imports ApiClient from a local module (.api_client). No input or data reading sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; the code does not process external inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as the code is primarily an import/export definition with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no unusual or suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named ApiClient from a local module and defines the __all__ variable for module exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network calls, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. It appears to be a simple module definition that facilitates usage of ApiClient elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as an API client interface for LinkedIn, with no suspicious activity detected.",
