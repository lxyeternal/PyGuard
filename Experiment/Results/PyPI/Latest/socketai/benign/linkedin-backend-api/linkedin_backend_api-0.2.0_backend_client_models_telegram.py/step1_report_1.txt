{
  "purpose": "Define a data model for notifications with validation, used to handle notification data within an application.",
  "sources": "Input data for user_id, message, parse_mode, disable_web_page_preview, created_at, and updated_at, typically from external sources such as user input, API requests, or database records.",
  "sinks": "Data stored in or retrieved from databases, logs, or transmitted over the network as part of API responses or requests.",
  "flows": "Input data (source) is validated and structured into a Notification object; the object’s attributes can be serialized and stored or transmitted (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. Usage of Pydantic is standard for data validation; no suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic model with various fields including user_id (int), message (str), parse_mode (str with default), disable_web_page_preview (bool with default), and optional datetime fields for created_at and updated_at. The structure is straightforward, serving as a data container with validation. No external data sources, code injections, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of optional fields and defaults suggests proper handling of data and no suspicious patterns. The code does not execute any untrusted code, connect to external servers, or handle secrets. It is a standard implementation of a data model for notification data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data model definition using Pydantic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions solely to validate and structure notification-related data.",
