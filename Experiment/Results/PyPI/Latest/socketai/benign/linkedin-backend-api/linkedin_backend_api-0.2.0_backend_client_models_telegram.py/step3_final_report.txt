  "purpose": "Data model for notification information, including user ID, message, parse mode, preview setting, and timestamps.",
  "sources": "Input data for user_id, message, parse_mode, disable_web_page_preview, created_at, updated_at",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data beyond data validation",
  "flows": "Input data assigned to model fields; no external or untrusted data flow occurs",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward Pydantic model with default values",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple, standard Pydantic data model with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. It does not perform any external operations or execute untrusted code. The message field could be misused if rendered insecurely elsewhere, but this is outside the scope of this code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal (0.1) to account for potential downstream misuse, which is outside the code's scope. Overall, the code is benign and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data container with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its straightforward nature.",
