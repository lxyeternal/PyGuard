  "purpose": "Define a data model for notifications using Pydantic, including user ID, message, and timestamps.",
  "sources": "Input data: user_id, message, parse_mode, disable_web_page_preview, created_at, updated_at",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted input could flow into the model's fields, but no direct sinks like network or file operations are present",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the Notification model fields; no external sink or output is explicitly present",
  "anomalies": "Default value for parse_mode is 'HTML'; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic model with typical fields for notification data. It includes optional timestamps and a default parse_mode. No external I/O, command execution, or suspicious code constructs are present. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward class definition indicates normal behavior. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data model for notifications with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It appears safe and typical for such use cases.",
