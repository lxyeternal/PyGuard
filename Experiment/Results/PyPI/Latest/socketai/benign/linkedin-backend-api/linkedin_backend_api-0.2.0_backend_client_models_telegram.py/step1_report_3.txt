  "purpose": "Define a data model for notifications with validation and default values using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "Input data for user_id, message, parse_mode, disable_web_page_preview, created_at, updated_at.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the message field could be used for malicious content if rendered insecurely; timestamps are generated or received data.",
  "flows": "Input data → Validation via Pydantic model → Stored or used elsewhere in the system.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs detected. Usage of default parse_mode is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic BaseModel with several fields, including optional timestamps and default values. It does not include any network calls, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. The message field could potentially be exploited if rendered insecurely elsewhere, but in this code, it is simply a data container. No malicious behavior or malicious payloads are present. The structure and imports are standard for data validation and do not pose security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data model definition for notification objects. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe and appears purely for data validation purposes.",
