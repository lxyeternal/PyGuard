  "purpose": "Define a data model for notifications using pydantic's BaseModel",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, pydantic, and datetime modules; class attribute definitions",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; no untrusted data handling beyond attribute definitions",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input or external systems",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of pydantic for data validation with default values and optional fields",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for type annotations, data validation, and datetime handling. It defines a Notification class inheriting from pydantic's BaseModel with several fields, including user_id, message, parse_mode, disable_web_page_preview, created_at, and updated_at. Default values are provided for parse_mode and disable_web_page_preview. All fields are standard data types with no dynamic or unsafe code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no external data handling. The code appears to serve as a schema or data container, not performing any malicious actions or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data model definition for notifications, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard library and third-party tools appropriately, with no evidence of obfuscated or malicious code.",
