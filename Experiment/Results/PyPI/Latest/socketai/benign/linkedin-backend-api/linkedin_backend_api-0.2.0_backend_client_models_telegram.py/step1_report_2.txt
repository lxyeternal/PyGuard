{
  "purpose": "Define a data model for notifications using pydantic, likely for a messaging or alert system.",
  "sources": "Input data from external sources such as user input, API requests, or database records for fields: user_id, message, parse_mode, disable_web_page_preview, created_at, updated_at.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage if the message contains sensitive info, or if unvalidated input is used in further processing such as sending messages or storing data.",
  "flows": "Input data (user_id, message, parse_mode, disable_web_page_preview, created_at, updated_at) flows into the Notification model, which validates and structures the data for downstream use.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no obfuscated code. The default value for parse_mode is 'HTML', which is typical for message formatting; no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a pydantic model with standard field types and default values. It imports necessary modules, with no external calls or dynamic code execution. The model is typical for data validation and does not include any suspicious logic or behavior. No sources or sinks suggest malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data model for notifications, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It is a standard implementation for structured data validation, and the code appears safe.",
