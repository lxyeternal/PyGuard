  "purpose": "Defines data schemas for prompt, relevance, and usage metadata using Pydantic models.",
  "sources": "Input data from user_requirements, vacancy_text, prompt string, and optional usage metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; models are for validation only, no external data handling or processing.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into model instances; no data processing or external interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward data schema definitions with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Pydantic model definitions with simple, well-structured fields. No runtime logic, external data handling, or dynamic code execution is present. The models serve as data validation schemas, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is safe, purely declarative, and appropriate for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard set of data models with no malicious or security concerns. All reports' assessments are accurate. No modifications are necessary; the overall security risk is negligible.",
