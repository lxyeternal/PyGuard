{
  "purpose": "Define data models for handling prompt input, output, and relevance analysis in a system likely related to AI or NLP tasks.",
  "sources": "Code reads static class definitions and type annotations; no runtime input or external data sources are accessed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified where untrusted data affects system behavior or leaks information.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks, as the code only defines data models.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The models are straightforward and use standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple Pydantic data models for structured data validation and serialization. It imports only standard and well-known libraries ('typing' and 'pydantic') and defines models for usage metadata, prompt input, output JSON, and relevance analysis. There are no dynamic code execution, external data access, or suspicious behaviors. The models are designed to facilitate data passing within an application, not to perform any operations that could compromise security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of plain data models with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a safe, standard implementation for structured data handling in an AI/NLP context.",
