{
  "purpose": "Define data models for prompt input, output, and relevance analysis in a system that likely interacts with user prompts and responses.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources of untrusted data; models accept data via structured input fields such as 'prompt', 'user_requirements', and 'vacancy_text'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; no code executes with untrusted data, no external calls, or file/network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input into the data models but are confined to data validation and structure; no processing or dangerous operations occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed. The models are straightforward data containers.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several Pydantic models for structured data validation, likely used for handling prompts, responses, and metadata. No functions, execution logic, or external interactions are present. The models specify optional fields and typed data but do not process or execute any data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a schema or data validation layer without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears safe, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
