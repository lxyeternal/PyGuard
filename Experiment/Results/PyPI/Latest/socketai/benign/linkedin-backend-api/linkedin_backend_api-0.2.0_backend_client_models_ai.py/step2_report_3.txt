  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely defining data models using Pydantic.\n- No runtime logic, external data handling, or code execution is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign maximum confidence (1) and zero malware, obfuscated, or security risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the descriptions: data models for prompts, relevance, and metadata.\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n- No data flow, external calls, or processing logic that could be malicious.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- They correctly identify that the code is purely structural and safe.\n- No over- or under-scoring issues are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware: 0`\n  - `securityRisk: 0`\n  - `obfuscated: 0`\n  - `confidence: 1`\n- These are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since the code is only data model definitions with no runtime or external data handling, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n- The malware score is correctly zero because there's no malicious activity.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as safe.\n- No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: all are zero or maximum confidence in safety.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is a straightforward, safe set of data models with no security concerns.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n- No changes needed.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.",
