{
  "purpose": "Define data models for input and output handling in a system that likely processes prompts and relevance assessments.",
  "sources": "None (no data input reading beyond data model definitions).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output or external system interactions).",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow detected; models are for structured data handling without processing or executing external data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code structures, no obfuscated code, and no hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines several Pydantic models for data validation and serialization. These models specify fields for prompts, metadata, relevance assessments, and output structures. The code appears to serve as a data schema without any logic that could be malicious, such as executing untrusted code or accessing external resources. There are no source-to-sink data flows, no unsafe handling of input, and no suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, defining data models without any execution or external data handling logic. It presents no signs of malicious intent or security risks. Overall, it is safe and does not contain malware.",
