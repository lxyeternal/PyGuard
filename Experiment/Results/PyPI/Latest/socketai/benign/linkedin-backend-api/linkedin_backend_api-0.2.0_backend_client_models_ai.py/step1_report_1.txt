{
  "purpose": "Define data models for input and output structures related to prompts, relevance assessment, and usage metadata.",
  "sources": "Code imports and class definitions, primarily from 'typing' and 'pydantic'. No data input reading or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only defines data schemas.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are used for data validation and serialization but do not process data within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. UsageMetadata fields are simple integers without validation constraints that could mask malicious data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several Pydantic models for structured data validation. No runtime logic, external data handling, or dynamic code execution is present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are detected. The models appear intended for use in API inputs/outputs or data processing pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of data model definitions with no indication of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and non-malicious.",
