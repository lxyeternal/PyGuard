  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is purely declarative, defining data models with no runtime logic, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The code only uses standard libraries ('typing' and 'pydantic') to define data schemas.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks are detected across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues in the code:\n- **Issue presence:** None of the reports identify any actual issues or vulnerabilities in the code. The code is straightforward data model definitions.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors, flaws, or mistakes are reported or evident. The models are well-structured, with appropriate optional fields and type annotations.\n\n### Logical and reasoning review:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely declarative, with no data processing, external interactions, or dynamic execution.\n- They also correctly note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- The reasoning that the code is safe and non-malicious is sound.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- All reports assign:\n  - **confidence:** 1 (full confidence, appropriate)\n  - **obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n  - **malware:** 0 (correct)\n  - **securityRisk:** 0 (correct)\n\n- The scores seem consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Potential issues or points to challenge:\n- Since all reports agree and the code is simple, there's no basis to increase the malware score.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low, given the lack of any malicious activity.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities that are not evident; the reports are cautious and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is a straightforward, safe set of data models with no malicious or security issues.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n- The code is safe, non-malicious, and purely structural.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
