{
  "purpose": "Define data models for prompt handling and metadata using pydantic for input validation and serialization.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; code only defines classes for data structure.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to data structure definitions without processing or transformation logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple pydantic BaseModel subclasses for organizing data related to prompts, usage metadata, and relevance scoring. It employs type annotations and optional fields appropriately. There are no functions that execute or evaluate untrusted input, no dynamic code execution, and no network or system calls. It appears to be purely structural, serving as a schema for data validation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are evident. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical design patterns for data modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data model implementation with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely defines data schemas without processing or executing untrusted data.",
