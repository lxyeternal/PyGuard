{
  "purpose": "Provides decorators and utilities for persistent state management in Python functions, including stateful decorators and configuration settings.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'statefulpy.decorator' and 'statefulpy.config'; 'atexit' registration for '_flush_all_state'.",
  "sinks": "Function calls to '_flush_all_state', which may perform state persistence operations, and imports that could load external code or data if not carefully managed.",
  "flows": "The code initializes modules and registers a shutdown handler that calls '_flush_all_state' to persist state before exit.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual or malicious constructs. The '_flush_all_state' function is called on exit, which is standard for cleanup, but without seeing its implementation, its safety cannot be fully confirmed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports core components for stateful function management and registers an exit handler for cleanup. It offers an API for managing persistent state with no evident malicious logic. The call to '_flush_all_state' during shutdown suggests persistence of internal state, which is typical for such libraries. No signs of backdoors, malicious data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are apparent. However, the actual behavior depends on the implementation of imported functions, which are not provided here.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign package for persistent state management with no indications of malicious intent. Its safety largely depends on the implementation of '_flush_all_state' and other imported components, which are not shown. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident based on this fragment.",
