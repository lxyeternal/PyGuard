{
  "purpose": "Provides a Python library for persistent state management with decorators and utilities for automatic state persistence and recovery.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'statefulpy.decorator' and 'statefulpy.config'; atexit registration to flush state.",
  "sinks": "Function '_flush_all_state' called during exit to persist data; no other explicit sinks.",
  "flows": "Imports lead to exposing 'stateful', 'set_backend', 'get_config', and 'flush_state'; 'atexit' triggers '_flush_all_state' at program termination.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements. The '_flush_all_state' function is invoked during exit, which is standard for state management; no hidden or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup for a state management library. It imports core components, registers a cleanup function on program exit, and exposes certain functions. The function '_flush_all_state' is called during shutdown to ensure state persistence. No malicious or suspicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The code structure is clear and typical for such a library.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script for a state management library with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply manages state persistence during program shutdown, with no signs of sabotage or malicious behavior.",
