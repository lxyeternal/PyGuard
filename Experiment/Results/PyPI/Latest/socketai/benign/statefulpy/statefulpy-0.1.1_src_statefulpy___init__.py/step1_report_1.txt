{
  "purpose": "Provides decorators and utilities for persistent state management in Python functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'statefulpy' modules: 'stateful', '_flush_all_state', 'set_backend', 'get_config'; also reads version string.",
  "targets": "Calls to '_flush_all_state' (for flushing state), potentially the 'set_backend' and 'get_config' functions if they perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "The code registers '_flush_all_state' to execute at program exit, and the 'flush_state' function calls '_flush_all_state' to flush state on demand.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious variable names, and no dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports and exposes functions related to state management, registers an exit handler for cleanup, and defines a function to flush state. It does not contain any code that interacts with external inputs, network, files, or environment variables. The imported functions '_flush_all_state', 'set_backend', and 'get_config' are assumed to be part of the 'statefulpy' package. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side-effects. The code appears to be a standard API interface for a Python library focused on state persistence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign interface module for the 'StatefulPy' library, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It only manages internal state through well-defined functions and registers cleanup handlers. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.",
