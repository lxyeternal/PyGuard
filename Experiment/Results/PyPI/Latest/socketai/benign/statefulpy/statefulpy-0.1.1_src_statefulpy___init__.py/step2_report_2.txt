  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, evaluating the reasoning, and assessing the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a simple interface exposing functions from 'statefulpy', registering an exit handler, and defining a flush function. No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The report correctly notes the absence of malicious behavior. It assumes imported functions are safe, which is reasonable given no evidence to the contrary.\n- **Scores:** Malware score = 0; security risk = 0. The confidence is high (1). These seem appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a straightforward setup with no malicious code.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The report mentions that '_flush_all_state' is called during shutdown, which is standard. No issues identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0; security risk = 0.1. The security risk is slightly above zero, perhaps considering that calling a flush function might involve writing data—though not necessarily malicious.\n- **Justification:** Since the actual implementation of '_flush_all_state' isn't provided, a small security risk score (0.1) is acceptable, assuming standard behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate scoring; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The analysis correctly notes that no suspicious behavior is apparent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0; security risk = 0. The confidence is high (1).\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The report is cautious, noting that the safety depends on the implementation of '_flush_all_state'. This is a prudent point.\n- **Errors or flaws:** It correctly refrains from assuming maliciousness without implementation details.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0; security risk = 0.2. Given the uncertainty about the implementation, a slightly higher risk score is justified.\n- **Justification:** Since the actual code of '_flush_all_state' isn't shown, assigning a modest risk score (0.2) is reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate, cautious scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to others, no malicious activity observed.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The report correctly states that the code is a utility interface with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0; security risk = 0.2. Given the standard nature, this is acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent.\n- **Risk scores:** Most are 0 or very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal concern.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — considering the potential for the imported functions to perform unsafe operations, but no concrete evidence.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and reasonable. The only point of contention might be the security risk scores, but given the lack of implementation details for '_flush_all_state', a cautious approach assigning a small risk (0.1–0.2) is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Malware         | 0              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0              |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1            |\n\nAll reports are aligned with this assessment.",
