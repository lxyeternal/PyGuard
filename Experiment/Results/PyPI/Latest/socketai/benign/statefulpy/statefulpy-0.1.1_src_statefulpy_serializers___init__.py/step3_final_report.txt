  "purpose": "The code provides serializer implementations for StatefulPy by importing relevant classes and functions from the 'statefulpy.serializers.base' module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'statefulpy.serializers.base' module",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution beyond static imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate; the slight risk score of 0.1 in one report is overly cautious but still within acceptable bounds. Given the simplicity and clarity, the overall assessment is that the code is safe and free of security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only straightforward import statements. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The risk score can be confidently set to 0 for consistency.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
