  "purpose": "Configuration management for StatefulPy, including setting, retrieving, and resetting backend options.",
  "sources": "Configuration functions (`set_backend`, `get_config`, `get_backend_options`, `reset_config`), which read and update the global `_CONFIG` variable.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe updates to `_CONFIG` in `set_backend`, which could influence application behavior if malicious input is provided; however, the code does not execute external data or commands.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., backend type and options) flows into `set_backend`, updating `_CONFIG`. Retrieval functions (`get_config`, `get_backend_options`) provide copies of `_CONFIG`. No external data flows into or out of these functions beyond parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. No suspicious network activity, code injections, or malicious side effects observed. The code is straightforward configuration management without hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines default configurations and provides functions to modify and retrieve configuration data stored in a global variable. Input validation is performed when setting the backend to prevent unknown backends. No external data sources, no command execution, and no encryption or decryption operations are present. The functions are safe and standard for configuration management. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The only potential concern is that improper use of `set_backend` could misconfigure the system, but this is expected behavior for such configuration code. Overall, the code appears benign with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration management implementation for a Python package, with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It safely manages configuration data without external dependencies or suspicious code. The overall security risk score is very low.",
