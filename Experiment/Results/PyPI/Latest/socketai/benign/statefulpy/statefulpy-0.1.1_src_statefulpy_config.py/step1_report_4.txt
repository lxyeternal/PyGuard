  "purpose": "Configuration management for StatefulPy, allowing setting and retrieving backend options.",
  "sources": "Input options via set_backend function parameters, configuration stored in global _CONFIG variable.",
  "sinks": "Modifications to the _CONFIG global variable, access to backend options via get_backend_options.",
  "flows": "set_backend receives input options, updates _CONFIG accordingly; get_backend_options retrieves data from _CONFIG.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated code or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages configuration state for a Python package with functions to set, get, and reset configurations. It uses safe practices like deep copying for data protection. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or insecure code patterns are present. The code is straightforward, primarily handling in-memory configuration data. It appears well-structured and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard configuration management without any malicious intent or security risks. It safely handles configuration data, with no indicators of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.",
