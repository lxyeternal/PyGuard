  "purpose": "Configuration management for StatefulPy, including setting and retrieving backend configurations.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (e.g., 'backend', '**options' in set_backend), global variables (_CONFIG, _DEFAULT_CONFIG).",
  "sinks": "Modifications to global configuration (_CONFIG), logging statements, and potential data exposure through get_config.",
  "flows": "set_backend reads parameters and updates _CONFIG; get_config returns a copy of _CONFIG; get_backend_options reads _CONFIG; reset_config resets _CONFIG to defaults.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No external network or file operations present. The code is straightforward configuration management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to manage configuration data, including setting backends, retrieving current config, and resetting to defaults. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection. The logging is standard and only outputs debug info. The functions handle configuration data securely by using deep copies. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration management module without any malicious intent or security risks. It manages configuration data safely and transparently, with no signs of malware or security issues.",
