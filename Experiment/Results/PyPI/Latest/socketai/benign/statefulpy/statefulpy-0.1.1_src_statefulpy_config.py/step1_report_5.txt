{
  "purpose": "Configuration management for StatefulPy, handling backend setup, options, and resets.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in functions such as 'set_backend', 'get_backend_options', and internal configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Global _CONFIG object being read or modified, especially in 'set_backend' and 'reset_config', but no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters to global configuration updates; no external data flow or output beyond configuration management.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution. Configuration options are typical and expected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard configuration setup with functions to set, get, and reset settings. No untrusted data inputs are processed in a manner that leads to security risks. No external network operations or file manipulations occur that could be malicious. The code appears purely for configuration management without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration management module with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It manages internal state securely and predictably without external threats.",
