  "purpose": "Configuration management for StatefulPy, allowing setting, retrieving, and resetting backend configurations.",
  "sources": "Reads default configuration data, user-provided options in set_backend, and internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "Updates to the global _CONFIG dictionary; no external data sinks or untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "set_backend updates _CONFIG with new backend and options; get_config and get_backend_options return copies of _CONFIG.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. No external network or file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, managing configuration data with validation and deep copies to prevent side effects. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or external data leaks are present. The functions perform as intended, with proper validation and data handling. No signs of malicious activity, network activity, or code injection are evident. The default connection strings are typical for configuration defaults, not secrets. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to misconfiguration, which is inherent to such modules but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration management module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
