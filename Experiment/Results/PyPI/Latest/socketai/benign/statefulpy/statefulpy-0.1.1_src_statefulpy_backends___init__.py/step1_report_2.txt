  "purpose": "Importing base classes and functions for backend implementations in StatefulPy.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'statefulpy.backends.base'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement and a brief comment describing backend implementations. There are no data inputs, outputs, or complex logic that could introduce security risks. Import statements are standard in Python and do not pose security concerns unless importing from untrusted sources, which is not indicated here.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module import with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It is safe based on the provided content.",
