  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements for three functions/classes: StateBackend, register_backend, and get_backend from a module within 'statefulpy'. There is no logic, data handling, or potentially dangerous operations. The code appears to be part of a larger project setup and does not execute any actions or contain any embedded data or control flows that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing simple import operations with no malicious intent or security risks evident within this snippet.",
