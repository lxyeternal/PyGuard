  "purpose": "This code provides backend implementations for the StatefulPy framework by importing base classes and registration functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'statefulpy.backends.base' module",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data or output points",
  "flows": "Imports from the module are straightforward; no data flows or processing shown",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a library module, serving as part of a larger backend system. It does not process or handle untrusted input, nor does it contain logic that could be exploited. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign code solely importing classes and functions necessary for backend registration in the StatefulPy framework. No malicious intent or security issues are present.",
