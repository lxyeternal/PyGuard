  "purpose": "Provides backend implementations for StatefulPy by importing base classes and functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'statefulpy.backends.base' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or potential security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths beyond import statements; no runtime data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a module docstring and import statements from a package. It does not include any executable logic, data processing, or user input handling. The imported functions and classes are standard for modular code organization and do not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward module setup with no malicious behavior or security risks. It merely imports components necessary for backend implementations of StatefulPy.",
