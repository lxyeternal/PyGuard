  "purpose": "Importing backend-related classes and functions for StatefulPy from the base module.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from statefulpy.backends.base import StateBackend, register_backend, get_backend",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows identified; the code only performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement that pulls specific classes and functions from a local or third-party module. It includes a comment indicating it pertains to backend implementations for StatefulPy, but contains no logic beyond the import. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The simplicity of this snippet limits the scope for malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing a standard import operation without any suspicious behavior or security concerns.",
