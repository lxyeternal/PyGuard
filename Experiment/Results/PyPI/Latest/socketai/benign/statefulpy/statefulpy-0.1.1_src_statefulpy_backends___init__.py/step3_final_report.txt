  "purpose": "Import backend classes and functions for StatefulPy framework setup.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'statefulpy.backends.base' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data flow; purely static import.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or execution beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module docstring followed by an import statement. It does not process data, execute logic, or handle untrusted inputs. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. All reports correctly identify this as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
