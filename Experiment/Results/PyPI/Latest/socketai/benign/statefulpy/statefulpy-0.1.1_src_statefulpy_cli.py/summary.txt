  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for backend management with no signs of malicious activity. The primary security consideration is the use of pickle, which could be risky if data sources become untrusted, but in this context, it is used safely. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and justified."
