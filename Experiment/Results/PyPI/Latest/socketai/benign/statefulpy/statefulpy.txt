      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for backend management with no signs of malicious activity. The primary security consideration is the use of pickle, which could be risky if data sources become untrusted, but in this context, it is used safely. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and justified."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward API wrapper for persistent state management, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the implementation of imported functions, which appears safe based on the provided snippet. Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2) is justified due to uncertainty about external functions."

The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin pattern with a known security consideration: dynamic import based on stored or user-supplied strings. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The primary security risk is supply chain or registry manipulation leading to remote code execution. Ensuring only trusted backend modules are registered and used mitigates this risk."

      "conclusion": "The code itself is not malicious and contains no obfuscation. The primary security concern is the potential for arbitrary code execution if external inputs influence the dynamic import paths. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The risk score should be considered moderate (~0.5) if inputs are untrusted. Implementing validation or whitelisting for serializer names and paths is advised to prevent exploitation."
