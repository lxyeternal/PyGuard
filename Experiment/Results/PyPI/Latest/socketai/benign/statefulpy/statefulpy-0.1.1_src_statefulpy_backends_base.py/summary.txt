  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin pattern with a known security consideration: dynamic import based on stored or user-supplied strings. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The primary security risk is supply chain or registry manipulation leading to remote code execution. Ensuring only trusted backend modules are registered and used mitigates this risk."
