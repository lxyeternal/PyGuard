  "purpose": "Defines an abstract interface and utility functions for state persistence backends, allowing registration and retrieval of backend implementations.",
  "sources": "User-provided backend type and path, importlib.import_module for dynamic module loading.",
  "sinks": "importlib.import_module dynamically loads modules based on backend_path, which could be manipulated if user input is not sanitized.",
  "flows": "Backend type and path -> get_backend -> importlib.import_module -> getattr -> instantiate backend class.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic module import with user-supplied module paths poses a potential security risk if backend_path is not validated or sanitized, as it could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an interface and functions for managing state backends. The get_backend function dynamically imports modules based on a backend_path string stored in _BACKENDS or registered via register_backend. If user input is used to supply backend_path without validation, it could lead to malicious module import or code execution. However, the default _BACKENDS dictionary contains hardcoded, trusted module paths, reducing immediate risk. The importlib.import_module function is a standard Python feature but can be exploited if backend_path is externally controlled. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The overall structure is straightforward, with potential risk associated with dynamic imports based on external input.",
  "conclusion": "The code is generally safe if backend_path values are controlled and validated. The primary concern is the potential for malicious module loading if user-supplied data influences the backend_path argument. Otherwise, there are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code.",
