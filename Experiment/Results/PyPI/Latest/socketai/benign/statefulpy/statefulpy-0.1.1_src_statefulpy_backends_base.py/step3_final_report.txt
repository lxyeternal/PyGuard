{
  "purpose": "Provides an abstract interface for state persistence backends and dynamic loading of backend implementations via importlib, allowing registration and retrieval of backend classes by name.",
  "sources": "The _BACKENDS registry dictionary, which maps backend names to module:class strings; the register_backend() function that adds entries; the get_backend() function that reads from _BACKENDS and dynamically imports modules and classes.",
  "sinks": "The dynamic import and getattr() calls, which can execute arbitrary code if the module paths or class names are malicious and untrusted inputs influence registration or parameters.",
  "flows": "The get_backend() function retrieves a backend string from _BACKENDS, splits into module and class, imports the module, retrieves the class, and instantiates it; if the module path or class name is malicious, code execution can occur.",
  "anomalies": "No embedded malware, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code relies on dynamic import, which is a known pattern with security implications but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a plugin-like pattern for backend management using dynamic import. The static _BACKENDS entries are safe; risks arise if external code modifies _BACKENDS or supplies malicious strings. No malware or obfuscation is detected. The main concern is potential remote code execution if malicious paths are registered or if untrusted input influences registration or get_backend parameters. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is moderate (~0.3-0.6) depending on environment controls. Proper validation or sandboxing can mitigate these risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin pattern with a known security consideration: dynamic import based on stored or user-supplied strings. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The primary security risk is supply chain or registry manipulation leading to remote code execution. Ensuring only trusted backend modules are registered and used mitigates this risk.",
