  "purpose": "Defines an abstract interface and utility functions for state persistence backends, allowing registration and retrieval of backend implementations.",
  "sources": "User-provided 'backend_type' argument in get_backend() function, which influences module import and class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import and instantiation of classes based on external input, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if input is maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "The 'backend_type' input in get_backend() is used to look up a string in _BACKENDS, then split into module and class name, imported, and instantiated.",
  "anomalies": "Potential security concern: 'backend_type' parameter controls dynamic import, which may lead to malicious module or class loading if not properly validated. No explicit validation is present beyond checking _BACKENDS keys.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class for state backends, a registry for backends, and a function to retrieve backend instances via dynamic import. The importlib.import_module() call and getattr() depend on _BACKENDS entries. While the default _BACKENDS mappings are fixed, the register_backend() function allows adding new entries, which could introduce malicious modules or classes if misused. Since 'backend_type' is validated against keys in _BACKENDS, the risk is somewhat mitigated, but if an attacker manages to modify the _BACKENDS dictionary or register malicious entries, it could lead to execution of arbitrary code. The core risk lies in the dynamic import and class instantiation based on external input.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself does not contain malicious behavior but has a potential security risk through dynamic imports controlled via the '_BACKENDS' mapping. Proper validation or restrictions should be enforced if external code can modify the registry. Currently, the implementation appears safe assuming only trusted modifications.",
