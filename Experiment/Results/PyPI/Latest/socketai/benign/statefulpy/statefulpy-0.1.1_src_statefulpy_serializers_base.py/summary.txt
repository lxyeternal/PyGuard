  "conclusion": "The code itself is not malicious and contains no obfuscation. The primary security concern is the potential for arbitrary code execution if external inputs influence the dynamic import paths. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The risk score should be considered moderate (~0.5) if inputs are untrusted. Implementing validation or whitelisting for serializer names and paths is advised to prevent exploitation."
