{
  "purpose": "Provide a decorator to make functions stateful with persistent backend storage, enabling state saving and loading across function calls.",
  "sources": "Imports (e.g., get_backend), get_backend function, the decorator function, and cleanup functions.",
  "sinks": "backend.load_state, backend.save_state, backend.acquire_lock, backend.release_lock, and attribute access (e.g., wrapper.state).",
  "flows": "Decorator loads state via get_backend, function executes, state is updated and saved, locks are acquired and released, cleanup saves state and releases locks.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically loads and saves state with no validation, but it uses standard functions and patterns; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard pattern for persistent state management using a backend, with lock handling and cleanup. It uses get_backend to fetch a backend instance, loads state, wraps functions to maintain state, and ensures cleanup at exit. No malicious code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious data leaks identified. It appears to be a legitimate state management decorator with proper lock handling and cleanup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate state management utility for Python functions with no evidence of malicious intent. It follows common patterns, with no suspicious behaviors or backdoors detected.",
