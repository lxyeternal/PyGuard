  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns. Usage of standard setup tools and straightforward code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports package version info from 'rynz', reads a README file, and calls 'setup()' from setuptools with package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. There are no dynamic code evaluations, external data manipulations, or secret handling. The code follows standard practices for Python package setup without any obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical and benign setup script for a Python package. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
