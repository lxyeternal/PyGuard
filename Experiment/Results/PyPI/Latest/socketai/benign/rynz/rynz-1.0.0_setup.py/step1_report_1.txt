{
  "purpose": "This script is used to configure and install the 'rynz' Python package, including reading the package description and defining package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; imports version info from 'rynz' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data flow or output operations detected.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content and passes it to setup(); imports version from 'rynz'. No external data flows into executable code beyond standard setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. Usage of standard setup tools and typical metadata fields.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python module. It reads a description file, imports version info, and defines package metadata and dependencies. No external data is processed dynamically, no user input is handled, and there are no suspicious code constructs or behaviors. The module 'rynz' is imported only to retrieve version info, which is typical in such scripts. All practices conform to standard packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional setup script for packaging and distribution with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
