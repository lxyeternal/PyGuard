{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package called 'rynz', which appears to be a static site generator, and it defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports '__version__' from the 'rynz' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; package setup parameters do not handle untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Reads package description from README.md and version from 'rynz' module, then passes data to 'setup()' function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard 'setuptools' for packaging, reads a description file, and uses module attribute for versioning. All operations are standard for Python package setup. No untrusted input processing, no dynamic code execution, and no network operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
