{
  "purpose": "The setup.py script is used to package and distribute the Python project 'rynz', including defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports __version__ from rynz module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external command execution.",
  "flows": "Reads local file 'README.md' -> uses imported '__version__' -> passes metadata to 'setup()' for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected. The code is standard for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for packaging, reads the project description from a local markdown file, and sets up package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and console entry points. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, dynamic code execution, or secret handling. It adheres to common setup.py patterns without suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
