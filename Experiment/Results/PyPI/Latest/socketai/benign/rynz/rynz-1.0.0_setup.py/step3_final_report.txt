  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, reading README.md for long description and importing version info from the 'rynz' module.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file; imports __version__ from 'rynz' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Reads static file and imports version; no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscated patterns, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script used for packaging Python projects. It reads a local README.md file for the long description and imports a version string from the 'rynz' module. There are no dynamic code executions, network activities, or handling of untrusted input. The code structure is straightforward, with clear and standard practices. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero, which aligns with the code's behavior and content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Python packaging script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All assessments and scores are justified and consistent. It is safe to use.",
