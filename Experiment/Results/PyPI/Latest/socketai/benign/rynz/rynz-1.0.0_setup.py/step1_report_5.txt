{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'rynz', defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; importing '__version__' from 'rynz'; static package setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or execution; no code that executes or evaluates external inputs dynamically.",
  "flows": "Reading description from file -> passing metadata to setup() -> installing dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials beyond standard package metadata, no obfuscated or dynamic code execution, no suspicious imports or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard 'setup.py' for Python packaging using setuptools. It reads a Markdown file for description and imports a version string from the package. The dependencies and metadata are typical for a package setup. No untrusted data flows or malicious code execution are evident. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present in the code structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
