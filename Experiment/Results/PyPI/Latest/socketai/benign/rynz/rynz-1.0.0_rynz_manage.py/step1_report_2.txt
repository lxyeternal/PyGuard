  "purpose": "This script provides configuration management, server hosting, and Git automation for a web project.",
  "sources": "Reads config.yml file, reads index.html, reads environment variables (indirectly via subprocess), user input via Prompt, file system checks, subprocess calls to git.",
  "sinks": "Writes to config.yml, reads and possibly executes subprocess commands, reads files (index.html), network server (hosted server), git commands.",
  "flows": "Loads config.yml -> Validates files -> User inputs for config modifications -> Saving config -> Starting server -> Executing git commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obvious backdoors or hidden malicious code. The code executes subprocess commands for git operations, but these are standard. No suspicious domain connections or data exfiltration observed. The code is well-structured, and no obfuscated code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages configurations, starts a local HTTP server, and automates Git workflows. It reads configuration files and index.html for validation, and allows user interaction for config management. It uses subprocess to run git commands, which is typical for automation scripts. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or network connections to suspicious domains are present. The server runs locally, and the subprocess calls are standard for version control management. No malicious or sabotage code detected. The code is straightforward and appears legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate configuration and server management utility with no indications of malicious intent. It performs standard operations safely, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
