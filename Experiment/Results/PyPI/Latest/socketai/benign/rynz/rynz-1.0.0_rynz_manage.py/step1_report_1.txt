{
  "purpose": "The script manages configuration files, runs a local HTTP server, and automates Git operations for a static site project.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'config.yml', local files ('index.html', other configs), user prompts, environment variables, and subprocess outputs.",
  "sinks": "Executes subprocess commands (git), reads files (index.html, config.yml), and writes to files (config.yml).",
  "flows": "User input via prompts and command-line arguments influence file reads/writes and subprocess commands, particularly git staging/committing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious external network calls. Use of subprocess with git commands is standard, but could be exploited if environment is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code performs configuration validation, server management, and version control automation. No obfuscated code, no malicious payloads detected. The subprocess calls to git could be misused if the environment is malicious, but within the context of legitimate project management, this is standard. File validation steps and structure are typical for project setup scripts. No indicators of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior found. Overall, the script is a utility for local development and deployment, with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate management tool for project configuration, server hosting, and version control. No malicious or sabotage behaviors detected. It uses standard practices for local server hosting, config management, and git automation.",
