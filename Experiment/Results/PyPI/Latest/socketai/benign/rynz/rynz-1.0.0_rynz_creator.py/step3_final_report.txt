{
  "purpose": "This script initializes a static site project structure for Rynz, creating directories, configuration files, templates, and sample content based on user input.",
  "sources": "User input prompts, filesystem checks (os.path.exists), and predefined template content.",
  "sinks": "File creation (open/write), directory creation (makedirs), and console output.",
  "flows": "User input → validation → directory/file creation → writing templates and config files.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal URL validation (only checks for '.'), no sanitization of directory names, reliance on user input without thorough validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard directory and file operations for project scaffolding. It uses safe filesystem functions and does not include network activity, dynamic code execution, or hardcoded secrets. The minimal validation on URLs and user inputs could be improved but do not constitute security risks. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are present. The overall behavior is benign, intended for legitimate project setup.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, straightforward project scaffolding tool with no malicious intent or behavior. The security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting minimal validation and placeholder defaults. Overall, it is suitable for its purpose.",
