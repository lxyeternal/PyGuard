  "purpose": "Define and retrieve the version number of the rynz package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the hardcoded string '__version__' and the function 'get_version'.",
  "sinks": "The function 'get_version' returns the version string; no untrusted data flow is present.",
  "flows": "The version string is stored in '__version__' and returned via 'get_version' with no external input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a simple version identifier and a function to return it. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or code obfuscation. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose for version management without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only static version information and a simple getter function. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
