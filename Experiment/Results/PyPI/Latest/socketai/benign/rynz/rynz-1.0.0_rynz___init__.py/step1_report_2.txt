  "purpose": "To provide version information for the rynz package and a function to retrieve the current version.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines a string variable and a simple function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The function get_version() simply returns a static version string; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines a version string and a getter function with no external input, no dynamic execution, and no security-sensitive operations. The structure is simple and appears to be for metadata purposes only. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only as metadata for versioning. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
