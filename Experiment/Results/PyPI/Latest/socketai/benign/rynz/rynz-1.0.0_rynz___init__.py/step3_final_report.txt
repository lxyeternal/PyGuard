  "purpose": "Provides version information for the rynz package via a static string and a getter function.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static variable __version__ and function get_version() returning it.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "Function get_version() returns the static __version__ string directly.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of ASCII art and comments indicating draft status, but these are purely aesthetic and do not affect execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward versioning module with no dynamic behavior, external data, or malicious code. It contains only static data and a simple return function. No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious activity are present. The ASCII art and comments are benign and do not impact security. The code's simplicity and clarity support a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. All reports correctly identify these aspects, and the confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
