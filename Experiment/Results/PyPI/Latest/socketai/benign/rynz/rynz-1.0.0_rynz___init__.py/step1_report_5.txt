{
  "purpose": "Define and retrieve the version number for the rynz package",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or outputted",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only returns a static version string",
  "anomalies": "Presence of ASCII art and comments indicating a draft state, but no suspicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a static version string and a simple function to return it. It includes aesthetic ASCII art and metadata comments but no external input, network communication, or sensitive data handling. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior is present. The comments suggest it is a standard version module, with no indications of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version identifier module with no malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be a benign component of a larger package.",
