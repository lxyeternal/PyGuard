  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, well-structured CLI interface with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified given its delegation to external modules, which are outside the scope of this review. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose."
