The low security risk score (0.2) is justified given its delegation to external modules, which are outside the scope of this review. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose."

The security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting minimal validation and placeholder defaults. Overall, it is suitable for its purpose."
