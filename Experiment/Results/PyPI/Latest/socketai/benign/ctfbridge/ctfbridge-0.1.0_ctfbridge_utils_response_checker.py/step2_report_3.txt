  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code verification:**  \n   The original code snippet is straightforward:\n   - Checks `response.status_code` for 401 or 403, raising `SessionExpiredError`.\n   - Checks for 429, retrieves \"Retry-After\" header, raises `RateLimitError`.\n   - Uses standard response attributes and headers.\n   \n   No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code are present. The code performs typical API response validation.\n\n2. **Logical flaws or anomalies:**  \n   - The code correctly handles common session expiration and rate limiting scenarios.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, URLs, or credentials.\n   - No hidden or suspicious behavior.\n   - The logic aligns with standard practices.\n\n3. **Scores review:**  \n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are very low (mostly 0.1), which seems reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious intent.\n   - Confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0 across reports, matching the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential issues or assumptions:**  \n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is not malicious or obfuscated.\n   - The only minor point is that the `securityRisk` is slightly above zero, which could be justified if the exceptions could be misused in a larger context, but given the isolated code, this is acceptable.\n\n5. **Consistency and justification:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No report suggests any malicious or suspicious behavior that warrants a higher malware score.\n   - The response validation is standard, with no vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Score Type     | Recommended Value | Justification                                                                                 |\n|----------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| malware        | 0                   | No malicious behavior detected. The code is purely for response validation.               |\n| obfuscated     | 0                   | The code is clear and straightforward, no obfuscation present.                            |\n| securityRisk   | 0.1                 | Slightly above zero due to potential misuse of exceptions, but overall minimal risk.     |\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, legitimate HTTP response validation function with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain `malware: 0`  \n- Keep `obfuscated: 0`  \n- Keep `securityRisk: 0.1` (or possibly reduce to 0 if strict minimal risk is preferred)\n\nThis reflects the code's simplicity and safety.",
