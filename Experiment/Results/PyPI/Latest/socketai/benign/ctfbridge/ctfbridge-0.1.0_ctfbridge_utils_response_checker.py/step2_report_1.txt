  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, importing custom exceptions and checking response status codes to raise exceptions accordingly.\n   - The code does not contain any obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors.\n   - The logic aligns with standard HTTP response validation practices.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is simple, legitimate, and free of malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident in the summaries.\n   - The only minor point is that some reports assign a security risk of 0.1, which is conservative but acceptable given the context.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is appropriate.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are mostly 0.1, which seems to reflect a minimal but non-zero risk—probably due to the possibility of misusing exception raising in broader contexts.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), indicating the reviewers are certain about their assessments.\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are low (0.1), which is justified because, in a different context, raising exceptions could influence program flow, but here it’s standard error handling.\n   - No reason exists to assign higher risk scores since the code is benign and standard.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - All reports agree that the malware score is 0.\n   - There is no indication of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The code is a typical API response validation function.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims in the reports are based on unwarranted assumptions; all assessments are aligned with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis. The malware is 0, security risk is minimal, and confidence is high.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Risk Score:** **0.1** (reflecting minimal, standard response validation risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is legitimate, straightforward, and does not contain any malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The low security risk score is appropriate, given the function's purpose and implementation.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the reports' assessments.**",
