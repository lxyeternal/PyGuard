  "purpose": "To validate HTTP response status codes and raise specific exceptions for session expiration or rate limiting conditions.",
  "sources": "response.status_code and response.headers.get(\"Retry-After\")",
  "sinks": "Raising exceptions (SessionExpiredError, RateLimitError) which could influence program flow based on response status.",
  "flows": "response.status_code checks lead to raising specific exceptions; headers.get() provides optional retry timing info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures or obfuscated code; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The function inspects the response object for certain HTTP status codes: 401 or 403 trigger a SessionExpiredError, indicating an expired or invalid session; 429 triggers a RateLimitError, potentially with a retry duration from headers. The code is straightforward, employing standard response handling for API interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The exceptions raised are likely part of standard flow control in a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a standard response validation utility, raising appropriate exceptions for session expiry and rate limiting. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks.",
