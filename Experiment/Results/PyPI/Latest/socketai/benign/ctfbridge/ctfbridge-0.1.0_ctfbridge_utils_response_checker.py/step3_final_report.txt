  "purpose": "To validate HTTP responses by checking for session expiration or rate limiting, raising exceptions as needed.",
  "sources": "response.status_code, response.headers.get(\"Retry-After\")",
  "sinks": "Raising exceptions based on response status codes, potentially affecting program flow",
  "flows": "response.status_code checks lead to exception raises; response.headers.get(\"Retry-After\") used to inform exception message",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard response validation logic, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward validation of HTTP response status codes, raising custom exceptions for session expiration (401, 403) and rate limiting (429). It retrieves the 'Retry-After' header to include in the exception message. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The logic aligns with common API response handling practices. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity justify a malware score of 0 and a very low security risk score (~0.1). The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign response validation function with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its behavior.",
