  "purpose": "To check HTTP response status codes for session expiration or rate limiting and raise appropriate exceptions.",
  "sources": "The response object, specifically response.status_code and response.headers",
  "sinks": "Raising exceptions based on response status codes",
  "flows": "response.status_code checks -> exception raises based on status codes",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, verifying response status codes and raising specific exceptions accordingly. It uses imported exception classes and inspects response attributes. No dynamic code execution, data leakage, or suspicious network activity present. The logic aligns with standard HTTP response handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard check for session expiration and rate limiting based on HTTP response codes. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk detected. The code appears to be a legitimate part of an API client or similar system.",
