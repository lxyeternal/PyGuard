{
  "purpose": "The function checks HTTP response status codes for session expiration or rate limiting and raises appropriate exceptions.",
  "sources": "response.status_code, response.headers",
  "sinks": "raising exceptions based on response status and headers",
  "flows": "response.status_code (source) → conditional checks → exceptions raised (sink); response.headers.get (source) → used in exception message",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard response validation without hidden or suspicious behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code imports custom exceptions, defines a function to validate HTTP responses, and raises specific exceptions for 401, 403, and 429 status codes. It reads status code and headers from the response object, which are typical in HTTP handling. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious URL or domain, or hidden malicious logic is present. The function is straightforward and intended for error handling related to session and rate limiting issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard response validation function without any signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears to be part of a legitimate API client implementation, focusing on error handling for common HTTP issues.",
