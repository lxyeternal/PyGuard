  "purpose": "To validate HTTP responses and raise exceptions for session expiration or rate limiting scenarios.",
  "sources": "response.status_code and response.headers.get('Retry-After')",
  "sinks": "Raising exceptions based on response status codes and headers",
  "flows": "response.status_code check -> potential exception raised; response.headers.get('Retry-After') used in exception message",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed. The code performs straightforward validation without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the status code of an HTTP response object and raises specific exceptions if the status indicates an expired session (401 or 403) or rate limiting (429). It retrieves the 'Retry-After' header to include in the RateLimitError message. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious data handling. The structure and logic are typical for API response validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, legitimate response validation function with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain obfuscation or malware and performs expected behavior in API response handling.",
