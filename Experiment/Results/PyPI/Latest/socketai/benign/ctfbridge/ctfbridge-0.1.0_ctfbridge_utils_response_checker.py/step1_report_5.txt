  "purpose": "The code checks HTTP response status codes to handle session expiration and rate limiting errors.",
  "sources": "response.status_code and response.headers.get('Retry-After')",
  "sinks": "Raising exceptions based on response data",
  "flows": "response.status_code and response.headers.get() flow into exception raising",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual language features, or obfuscation observed; the code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific exceptions, defines a function to validate HTTP responses, and raises custom exceptions when certain status codes are detected. It checks for 401 and 403 to indicate session expiration or unauthorized access, raising SessionExpiredError. It checks for 429 (rate limiting), retrieves the Retry-After header, and raises RateLimitError with the retry time. The logic is standard for HTTP response handling with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code performs input validation and exception raising, which are typical in API response handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard response validation for session and rate limiting errors. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are evident. The code is clean, straightforward, and appears safe.",
