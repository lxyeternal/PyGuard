  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the original code carefully.\n\n**Code Confirmation:**\n- The code is a simple function that inspects `response.status_code` and `response.headers.get(\"Retry-After\")`.\n- It raises `SessionExpiredError` for 401 or 403, and `RateLimitError` for 429, including the retry-after header if available.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious logic, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious behavior are evident.\n\n**Review of the Reports:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as straightforward, standard HTTP response validation.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent are observed.\n- The logic aligns with common API client patterns.\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports is justified. No malicious activity or code behavior is indicated.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 in all reports seems slightly conservative; the code's purpose is purely validation, with no security risk beyond typical exception handling. Given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior, a risk score of 0.1 is acceptable, though it could arguably be 0.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies:**\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- The confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), which is reasonable.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, safe, and legitimate API response validation function.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n- The overall security risk is minimal; a score of 0.1 is acceptable but could be lowered to 0 for maximum precision.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the reports' consensus. The code is safe, straightforward, and performs expected validation without any malicious or obfuscated elements.",
