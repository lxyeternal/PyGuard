      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor issue is the use of 'any' instead of 'Any' in type annotations, which does not impact security. All security and malware scores should be 0, and obfuscation scores should be 0. The slight elevation in security risk scores in some reports (e.g., 0.1) is unwarranted and should be adjusted to 0."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs a simple detection task; however, it has a notable security concern (SSRF) due to lack of URL validation. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0. The security risk score should be increased from 0.1 to approximately 0.3 to reflect this vulnerability."

No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the analysis."

      "confidence": 0.6,
      "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and potential malicious patterns, particularly in report 1, which justifies a malware score of approximately 0.6 and an obfuscation score of around 0.4. Other reports indicate benign code with scores near zero. Overall, the security risk is moderate (~0.6), consistent with the suspicion levels. Further code review is recommended to confirm malicious intent, but current scores are justified based on the available information."
