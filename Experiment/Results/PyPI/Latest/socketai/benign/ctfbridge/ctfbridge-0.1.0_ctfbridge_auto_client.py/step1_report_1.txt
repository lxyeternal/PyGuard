  "sinks": "Returning instances of DemoClient or CTFdClient based on platform detection",
  "flows": "detect_platform(base_url) -> conditional checks -> import of specific client class -> return of client instance",
  "anomalies": "Conditional imports within function, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious external connections or data leaks",
  "analysis": "The code performs platform detection using a function call and imports specific client classes based on the detected platform. The imports are localized within the conditional blocks, which is a common pattern for optional dependencies. No hardcoded secrets, no network operations, and no suspicious code constructs are present. The raise statement properly handles unknown platforms with a custom exception. Overall, the code is straightforward and does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard platform-based client selector with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The dynamic imports are typical for modular design and do not introduce malware risks.",
