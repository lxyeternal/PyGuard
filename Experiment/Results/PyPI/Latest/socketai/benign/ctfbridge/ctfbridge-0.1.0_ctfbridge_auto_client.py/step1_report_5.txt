  "purpose": "Selects and returns a platform-specific client object based on platform detection from a URL.",
  "sources": "detect_platform function call with base_url as input",
  "sinks": "Return statements creating instances of platform-specific clients (DemoClient or CTFdClient)",
  "flows": "detect_platform -> conditional checks -> import of client class -> return client instance",
  "anomalies": "Conditional dynamic imports based on detected platform; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code; standard pattern",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports platform-specific client classes based on the detected platform. The detect_platform function is used to determine the platform from the input URL. Depending on the platform, it imports the corresponding client class and returns an instance initialized with the URL. The import statements are conditional and occur only after platform detection, which is a common pattern to reduce unnecessary dependencies. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or hidden behaviors. The code does not perform any network activity, data leakage, or malicious system modifications. It is a straightforward factory method for client instantiation based on platform detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard platform-based client factory with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It performs expected import and instantiation operations based on platform detection without any suspicious activity.",
