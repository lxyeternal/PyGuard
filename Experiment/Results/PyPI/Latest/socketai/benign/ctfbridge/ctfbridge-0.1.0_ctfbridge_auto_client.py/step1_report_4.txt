  "purpose": "Selects and returns a platform-specific client object based on the detected platform from a given URL.",
  "sources": "detect_platform function call, imports within function based on platform",
  "sinks": "Return statements returning instantiated client objects",
  "flows": "detect_platform -> conditional branch -> import and instantiate client -> return client",
  "anomalies": "Conditional dynamic imports based on detected platform; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically determines the platform type from a URL using detect_platform. Based on the platform, it conditionally imports and returns specific client classes. The imports are done within the function, which is not inherently suspicious but can be considered unusual. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious data flows are present. The function raises an error if the platform is unknown, which is standard practice. No external data is read beyond the detect_platform function, which itself is not provided here. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward platform detection and client instantiation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs safe platform detection and client instantiation with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It uses conditional imports and raises appropriate errors for unknown platforms. No security risks or malware indicators are evident.",
