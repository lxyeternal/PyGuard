  "purpose": "Selects and returns a platform-specific client object based on the detected platform type from a URL.",
  "sources": "detect_platform function (from ctfbridge.utils.platform_detection) that reads the base_url input.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of platform-specific client classes (DemoClient, CTFdClient) which may perform network operations or other actions upon creation.",
  "flows": "Input (base_url) -> detect_platform -> conditional branch -> import and instantiate specific client class.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional dynamic import of modules within function; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs platform detection based on the provided URL and imports the corresponding client class dynamically. The imports are conditional, based on the detected platform. The use of dynamic imports inside functions is not inherently suspicious but should be noted for potential delay or import-time issues. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code raises an exception if the platform is unknown, which is standard behavior.\n\nSince the imported modules and their behaviors are not provided, the review is limited to this file. No network connections, data leaks, or malicious actions are apparent from this code alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard platform detection and client instantiation pattern. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this fragment. The dynamic import pattern is acceptable in this context, assuming the imported modules are trustworthy.",
