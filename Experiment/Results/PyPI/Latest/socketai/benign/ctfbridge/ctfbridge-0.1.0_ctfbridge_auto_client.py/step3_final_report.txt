  "sinks": "Return of platform client object, raising UnknownPlatformError",
  "flows": "detect_platform -> conditional import -> return client instance or raise error",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports within conditional blocks; no hardcoded secrets or network activity",
  "analysis": "The code performs platform detection and conditionally imports and returns the appropriate client class. No malicious behavior, secrets, or suspicious code constructs are present. Dynamic imports are localized and standard for plugin architectures. No signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent are evident. The scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. The pattern of dynamic import, while generally acceptable, should be maintained with trusted modules to prevent supply chain risks. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and does not pose security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard platform detection and client instantiation pattern with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The dynamic import pattern is typical and does not introduce vulnerabilities here. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
