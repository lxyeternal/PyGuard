{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for challenge management and submission results in a coding or CTF platform.",
  "sources": "Code imports (dataclasses, typing), class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent data sinks; no external data handling, I/O, or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from input sources to sensitive sinks; only class definitions with default values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard use of dataclasses and type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes two data classes, Challenge and SubmissionResult, with typical fields. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. No dynamic execution, code injection, or obfuscated code present. The code appears to be purely for data modeling within an application, with safe default values and no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign data model setup with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling logic.",
