  "purpose": "Define data structures for challenge management and submission results in a Python application.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; code reads only its own defined class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow beyond class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'any' in type annotations instead of 'Any' from typing; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two straightforward data classes, Challenge and SubmissionResult, with default values and standard types. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The use of 'any' is a minor stylistic issue but not security-related. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is purely a data model with no vulnerabilities or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor issue is the use of 'any' instead of 'Any' in type annotations, which does not impact security. All security and malware scores should be 0, and obfuscation scores should be 0. The slight elevation in security risk scores in some reports (e.g., 0.1) is unwarranted and should be adjusted to 0.",
