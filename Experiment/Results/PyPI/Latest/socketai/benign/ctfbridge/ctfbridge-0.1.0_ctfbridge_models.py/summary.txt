  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor issue is the use of 'any' instead of 'Any' in type annotations, which does not impact security. All security and malware scores should be 0, and obfuscation scores should be 0. The slight elevation in security risk scores in some reports (e.g., 0.1) is unwarranted and should be adjusted to 0."
