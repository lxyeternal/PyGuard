{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for challenges and submission results, likely for a quiz or challenge platform.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'dataclasses', 'typing' modules; class and field definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data handling or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only declares data models.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'any' in type hints (should be 'Any'), but this is a common pattern. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two dataclasses, 'Challenge' and 'SubmissionResult', with standard fields and default factories. No user input handling, external data processing, or malicious patterns. The use of 'any' in type hint is a minor issue but not malicious. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data model setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
