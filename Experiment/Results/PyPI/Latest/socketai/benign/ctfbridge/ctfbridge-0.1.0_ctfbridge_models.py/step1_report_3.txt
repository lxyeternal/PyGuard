  "purpose": "Define data structures for challenge and submission result representations",
  "sources": "Code defining data classes and their default factories",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only data class definitions and default value assignments",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or unusual code constructs detected. Use of generic 'any' in type annotation is acceptable in Python 3.9+ but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two data classes, Challenge and SubmissionResult, using Python's dataclasses module. It employs type annotations, default factories for list and dict fields, and optional fields. There are no user inputs, network operations, or external data sources. The code appears to serve as a data model structure with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, standard implementation of data structures with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It functions solely as a data container.",
