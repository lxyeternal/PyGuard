  "purpose": "Define data structures for challenges and submission results in a challenge system.",
  "sources": "Code imports from 'dataclasses' and 'typing', and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only declares classes and default values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes Python dataclasses to define structured data types for challenges and submissions. It imports standard modules, uses default factory functions for list and dict attributes, and contains no dynamic code execution, obfuscated constructs, or external data interactions. The code appears straightforward and standard for modeling data objects. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is evident based on the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data modeling implementation using Python dataclasses with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
