{
  "purpose": "Extend the requests.Session class to automatically check response validity, handle rate limiting, and retry requests as needed.",
  "sources": "Imports from requests, time, and local modules for response checking and exceptions.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is written or transmitted elsewhere; only internal request handling and sleep.",
  "flows": "Requests are made via super().request; response is checked, and upon rate limiting, the code sleeps and retries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a subclass of requests.Session to automate response validation and manage rate limits. It retries upon receiving a RateLimitError, waits based on the Retry-After header or defaults to 2 seconds, and limits retries to avoid infinite loops. All actions are typical for robust request handling. No malicious behavior or data exfiltration is present. The code relies on an external check_response_valid function and a custom exception, both presumably well-defined for validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of a resilient API session handler with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It responsibly handles rate limiting and response validation without introducing suspicious or harmful behavior.",
