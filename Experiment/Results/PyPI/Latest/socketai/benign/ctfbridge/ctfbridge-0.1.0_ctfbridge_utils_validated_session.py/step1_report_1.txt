  "purpose": "Custom requests.Session subclass that automatically checks response validity and handles rate limiting with retries.",
  "sources": "request() method makes HTTP requests via super().request; response.headers for 'Retry-After' header.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted response headers, but used only to control retry timing, no data leakage or system control.",
  "flows": "request() makes request -> check_response_valid(response) -> if RateLimitError -> get 'Retry-After' -> sleep -> retry or return response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution, straightforward flow.",
  "analysis": "The code extends requests.Session to add response validation and rate limiting retries. It uses external utility 'check_response_valid' to verify responses, which may raise RateLimitError, triggering retries with sleep intervals based on 'Retry-After' header. The code handles exceptions and retries up to a maximum number. No malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious code patterns are evident. It adheres to typical request handling practices with rate limit management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing HTTP sessions with built-in rate limit handling. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks are detected. It is a standard implementation for reliable API interaction.",
