{
  "purpose": "A custom requests.Session subclass that automatically checks for valid responses and handles rate limiting with retries.",
  "sources": "Imports 'time', 'requests', local modules 'check_response_valid' and 'RateLimitError'. Reads response headers for 'Retry-After'.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'time.sleep' to pause execution; raises RuntimeError on exceeding retries.",
  "flows": "Requests made via super().request(), response checked, on rate limit response sleeps and retries, response returned if valid.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. No suspicious code or data leaks present.",
  "analysis": "The code extends 'requests.Session' to include response validation and rate-limit handling. It uses a retry mechanism with sleep based on 'Retry-After' header. No data exfiltration, malicious network connections, or backdoors are present. The imported modules are local and presumed benign; no obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a safer HTTP session manager with automatic rate limit handling. No malicious intent or security risks identified.",
