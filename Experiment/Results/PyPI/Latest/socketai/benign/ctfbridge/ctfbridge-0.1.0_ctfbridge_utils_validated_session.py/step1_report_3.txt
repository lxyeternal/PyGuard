  "purpose": "Custom requests.Session subclass that automatically handles response validation and rate limiting retries.",
  "sources": "response.headers.get('Retry-After') and the request method to fetch data from a server.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the print statement (for logging), but no dangerous data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Request made via super().request() -> response checked with check_response_valid() -> retries if RateLimitError -> sleep based on Retry-After header.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code; the code performs standard retry logic based on headers. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the requests.Session class, adding automatic handling for rate limiting. It retries requests upon encountering a RateLimitError, respecting the 'Retry-After' header if present. No external untrusted data sources are directly processed, and the logic appears standard for rate-limited API interactions. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware is present. The use of print for logging is benign but could be replaced with proper logging in production. The code does not perform any data exfiltration, command execution, or system manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a controlled retry mechanism for rate limits with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It is a standard pattern for API client libraries handling rate limiting. No malware or security risks are identified.",
