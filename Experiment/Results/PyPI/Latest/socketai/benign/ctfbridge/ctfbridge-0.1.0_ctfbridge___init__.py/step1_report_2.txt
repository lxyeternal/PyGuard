  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for importing CTFdClient and get_client functions or classes from local modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .clients.ctfd_client and .auto_client",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this code only exports references",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports two components from local modules and exposes them via __all__, facilitating controlled module exports. It does not process data, handle untrusted inputs, or execute dynamic code. No signs of obfuscation or malicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module export setup with no malicious intent or security issues.",
