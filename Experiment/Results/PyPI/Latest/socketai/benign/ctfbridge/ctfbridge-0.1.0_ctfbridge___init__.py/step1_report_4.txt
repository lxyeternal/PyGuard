{
  "purpose": "Exports classes and functions related to client interactions, likely for a CTF or challenge platform.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .clients.ctfd_client and .auto_client",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code primarily involves imports and exports of symbols.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input; the code does not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with standard import/export syntax; no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules and exports them via __all__. There are no dynamic code executions, no handling of untrusted data, and no embedded credentials or malicious code. The structure is typical for Python modules that re-export functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module for re-exporting classes and functions. It poses no security threats or malicious behavior.",
