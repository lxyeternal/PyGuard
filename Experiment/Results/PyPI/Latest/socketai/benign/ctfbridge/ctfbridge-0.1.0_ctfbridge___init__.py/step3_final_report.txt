{
  "purpose": "This code module imports specific classes/functions from local modules and exposes them via __all__ for controlled symbol export within a package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules (.clients.ctfd_client and .auto_client)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only performs static imports and exports symbols",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process data or execute dynamic actions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export pattern with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports classes/functions and defines __all__ to specify exported symbols. It contains no data processing, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is to facilitate controlled symbol exposure within a package, which is a common and benign pattern. All reports correctly identify this as a safe, standard module setup. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious or risky behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module for exporting symbols with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
