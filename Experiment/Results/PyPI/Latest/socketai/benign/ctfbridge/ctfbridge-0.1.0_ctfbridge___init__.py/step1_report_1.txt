  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a package's __init__.py or a module that exposes certain classes and functions for external use, specifically CTFdClient and get_client.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .clients.ctfd_client and .auto_client",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input are present; no data is processed or output within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this snippet as it only imports and exports symbols without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing only imports and defining an export list. It does not include any logic, data processing, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be a straightforward module initialization or symbol export file. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for exposing specific classes and functions. No malicious behavior or security issues are detected. It is safe and typical of Python package modules.",
