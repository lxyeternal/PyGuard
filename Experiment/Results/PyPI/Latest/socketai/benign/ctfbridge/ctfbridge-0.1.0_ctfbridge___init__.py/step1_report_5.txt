  "purpose": "Defines exports for a module by importing specific classes/functions from relative modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: .clients.ctfd_client and .auto_client.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data processing occurs in this snippet; it only performs imports.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present in this code snippet; it only establishes namespace exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports two components and defines an export list. There are no data inputs, processing, or output mechanisms that could be exploited. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are detected. The code appears to be a straightforward module definition, serving as an interface to other components.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign and typical of Python modules used to organize and export classes/functions. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
