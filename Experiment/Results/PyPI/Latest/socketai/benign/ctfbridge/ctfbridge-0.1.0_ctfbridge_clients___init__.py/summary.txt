  "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and potential malicious patterns, particularly in report 1, which justifies a malware score of approximately 0.6 and an obfuscation score of around 0.4. Other reports indicate benign code with scores near zero. Overall, the security risk is moderate (~0.6), consistent with the suspicion levels. Further code review is recommended to confirm malicious intent, but current scores are justified based on the available information."
