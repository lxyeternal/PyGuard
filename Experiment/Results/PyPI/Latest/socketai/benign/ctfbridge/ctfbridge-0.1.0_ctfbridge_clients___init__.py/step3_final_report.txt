  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, external files, user input, dynamic functions (eval/exec), network or system calls.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, subprocesses, environment variables, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into dynamic execution or network functions; potential malicious data reaches sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, suspicious function usage, inconsistent or suspicious control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns such as obfuscation, dynamic execution, and hardcoded secrets, which are indicative of potential malicious intent. The suspicion is supported by the presence of obfuscation scores (~0.3) and malware scores (~0.4). Benign assessments lack such patterns, with scores at zero or near-zero. The overall security risk is elevated (~0.6) in suspicious cases, aligning with the potential for malicious activity. The confidence level (~0.6) reflects uncertainty due to lack of concrete code snippets but is justified by the patterns observed. The code's structure and signals suggest moderate suspicion, warranting cautious scoring.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and potential malicious patterns, particularly in report 1, which justifies a malware score of approximately 0.6 and an obfuscation score of around 0.4. Other reports indicate benign code with scores near zero. Overall, the security risk is moderate (~0.6), consistent with the suspicion levels. Further code review is recommended to confirm malicious intent, but current scores are justified based on the available information.",
