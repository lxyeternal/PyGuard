  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code defines a set of custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception, all with descriptive docstrings.\n   - There are no methods, attributes, or data processing within these classes.\n   - The classes are straightforward and serve as error indicators within a larger application.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - The code is purely class definitions for error handling.\n   - No input/output operations, data handling, network calls, or code execution.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n   - The reports uniformly conclude the code is benign and standard.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, consistent with straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Security Risk & Overall Risk Scores:** 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious activities are evident.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that this code is standard, harmless, and does not contain any malicious behavior.\n   - No assumptions are made beyond the code's apparent purpose; the reasoning is sound.\n\n5. **Score Justification & Recommendations:**\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are reasonable and justified.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code is only class definitions, it cannot cause harm by itself.\n   - Any security concern would only arise if these classes were misused or if malicious code was embedded elsewhere in the larger application.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reasoning above.",
