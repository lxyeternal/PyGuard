  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to a CTF platform.\n- They consistently note the absence of data handling, external calls, or suspicious behavior.\n- All reports assign a confidence level of 1, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores at 0.\n- The code appears to be straightforward, standard Python exception class hierarchy.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1. **Are the reported issues present?**  \n   Yes. The code matches the descriptions: only class definitions for exceptions, no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n   The reports correctly identify the nature of the code as benign, standard, and free of malicious intent. No logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports give malware and obfuscation scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature. The security risk score is also 0, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely class definitions with no external interactions or dynamic code, there's no basis for higher risk scores. The reports' scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any malicious actions—no code execution, network calls, or obfuscation. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for error handling.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is straightforward and does not pose any security threat.\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThere is no indication of malicious intent or security issues in this code snippet. The exception classes are typical for error handling in Python applications, especially in a CTF platform context.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Confirmed: No malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- Scores: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- Reasoning: The code is purely class definitions with no external or dynamic behavior.",
