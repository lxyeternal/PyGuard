  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in a CTF platform application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from CTFBridgeError, no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks; purely class declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class inheritance without data manipulation or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definitions with descriptive docstrings, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception class, with no methods, data handling, network calls, or dynamic code. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and free of malicious intent. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and clarity support the conclusion that it poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
