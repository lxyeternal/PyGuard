  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors in a CTF bridge application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and string documentation within class docstrings.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class inheritance and exception definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard exception class definitions without any unusual code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions, inheriting from a base exception class. Each class is used for specific error handling scenarios related to login, challenge fetching, submission, session management, rate limiting, and platform identification. There are no data inputs, outputs, or untrusted data handling mechanisms. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured set of exception definitions typical in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger application to handle errors systematically. No malware, obfuscation, or security concerns are evident.",
