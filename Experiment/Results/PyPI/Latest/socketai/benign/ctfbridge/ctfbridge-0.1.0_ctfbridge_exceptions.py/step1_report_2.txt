  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors in a CTFBridge application.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; solely class definitions.",
  "targets": "No data sinks or outputs; just exception class declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are used for error handling but do not process or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains class definitions inheriting from Exception, serving as custom error types for a CTF-related application. There are no inputs, outputs, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be standard, well-structured exception class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to define error types for a larger application. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
