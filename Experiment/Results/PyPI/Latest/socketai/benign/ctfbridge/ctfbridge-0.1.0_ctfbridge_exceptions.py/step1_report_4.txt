  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors in a CTFBridge application.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; only class definitions and inheritance.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations present.",
  "flows": "None, as this code solely defines exception classes without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard exception class hierarchy.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class, specifically for error handling within a CTFBridge context. Each class is straightforward, with docstrings explaining their purpose. There are no code execution, data handling, or network operations present. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are identified. The code is typical for defining application-specific exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is purely for defining exception types and has no harmful or suspicious features.",
