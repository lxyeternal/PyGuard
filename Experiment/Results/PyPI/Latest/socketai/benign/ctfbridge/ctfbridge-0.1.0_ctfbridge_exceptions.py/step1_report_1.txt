  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a Capture The Flag (CTF) platform's error handling.",
  "sources": "None (no data input or external data reading evident in the code).",
  "sinks": "None (no data processing or output, no external connections or data leaks).",
  "flows": "None (no data flows, as the code only defines exception classes).",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code execution, data handling, or suspicious behavior; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception class. All classes are simple, with no methods or attributes beyond inheritance. There are no input or output operations, no data handling, no external calls, nor any code that could be used maliciously. The code is standard for error handling in Python projects, specifically for a CTF platform.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is standard error class setup, and no security risks are identified.",
