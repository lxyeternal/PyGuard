{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors in a CTFBridge application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present, as this is solely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or suspicious behaviors; all classes are standard exception subclasses.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception class. No input/output operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution are present. The class names and docstrings are straightforward and do not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns. The code appears to be a standard way to organize error handling in a Python application, specifically related to a Capture The Flag (CTF) platform. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions for error handling in a Python application. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
