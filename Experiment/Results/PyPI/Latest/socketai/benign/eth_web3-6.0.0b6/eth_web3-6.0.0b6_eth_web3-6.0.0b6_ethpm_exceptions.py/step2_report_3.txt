  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code defines a set of custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception class `PyEthPMError`.\n   - Each class has a descriptive docstring explaining its purpose.\n   - The classes are empty and only serve as error categories.\n   - There are no data processing, external calls, dynamic behaviors, or embedded logic.\n\n2. **Security & Malware Considerations:**\n   - The code is purely structural, intended for error handling.\n   - No input/output handling, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are observed.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, benign, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is static class definitions for error handling.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1), and no anomalies or security risks are reported.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** Given the absence of any malicious or suspicious behavior, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward and not obfuscated; thus, 0 is correct.\n   - **Risk Score:** Since the code only defines error classes with no security implications, a low risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n5. **Potential Adjustments:**\n   - The scores assigned by the reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - No adjustments needed based on the evidence.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n| Score Type      | Suggested Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score   | 0                 | No malicious activity or behavior detected.                |\n| Obfuscated Score| 0               | Clear, straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation. |\n| Risk Score      | 0                 | No security risks or vulnerabilities evident.              |\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign and purely structural.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- Scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\nLet me know if you'd like a further deep dive or have other code snippets to review.",
