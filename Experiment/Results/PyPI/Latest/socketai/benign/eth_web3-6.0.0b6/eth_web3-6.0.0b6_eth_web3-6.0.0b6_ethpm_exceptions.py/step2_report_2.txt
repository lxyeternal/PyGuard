  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is purely class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from a base exception class.\n   - There are no executable statements, data processing, external calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The classes contain only docstrings and pass statements, serving as error categorization.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious constructs.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is static, with no data flows, external interactions, or embedded secrets.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident, given the simplicity of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment.\n   - These scores seem appropriate and reasonable given the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all 0, which is justified since the code does not pose any security threat.\n   - No need to increase scores; the assessments are accurate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, obfuscation, or dynamic execution.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are careful to state that the code is only defining exception classes.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made.\n   - The assessments are appropriate and cautious.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The high confidence and zero malware/security risk scores are justified.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n- The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No security issues, malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, well-structured, and typical for error handling in Python packages. No further action or concern is necessary.",
