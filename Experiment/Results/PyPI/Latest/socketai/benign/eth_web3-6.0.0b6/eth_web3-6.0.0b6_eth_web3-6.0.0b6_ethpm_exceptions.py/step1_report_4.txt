  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the Py-EthPM package.",
  "sources": "None, the code only defines exception classes without input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None, no data processing or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as this code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors; code structure is straightforward and typical for exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of custom exception classes inheriting from a base error class. There are no input/output operations, external data handling, or dynamic code execution. All classes are simple, empty subclasses meant for categorizing errors. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The code is purely for error handling logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for defining exception classes and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be safe and conventional, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
