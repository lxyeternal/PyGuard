{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes for error handling in the PyEthPM package, serving as error categories without executing logic.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from PyEthPMError, with no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the classes are static definitions with no runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no embedded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static class definitions for custom exceptions, with descriptive docstrings. There are no executable statements, data processing, or external interactions. The absence of dynamic behavior, secrets, or obfuscation indicates a benign structure. All reports correctly identify the code as standard, with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
