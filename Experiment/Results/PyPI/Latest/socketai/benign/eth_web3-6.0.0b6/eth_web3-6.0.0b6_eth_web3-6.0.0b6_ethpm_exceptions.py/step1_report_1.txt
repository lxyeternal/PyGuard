  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for the Py-EthPM package to handle various error conditions.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No data output, external calls, or untrusted data handling in the provided code.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions for custom exceptions related to the Py-EthPM package. These classes inherit from a base exception class and do not contain executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. There are no embedded or hidden malicious behaviors, no input/output flows, and no suspicious patterns present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining error classes without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard for Python package error handling.",
