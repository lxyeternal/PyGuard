  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the Py-EthPM package.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions and exception declarations only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class inheritance and exception declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of standard exception class definitions with docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base error class. Each class is a simple subclass with no additional logic, attributes, or dynamic code execution. There are no inputs, outputs, or external data sources. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be straightforward error handling structure, typical in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions for an error handling module, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It appears safe and solely for error categorization.",
