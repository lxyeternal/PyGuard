  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the Py-EthPM package.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leakage points present.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as these are just exception class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward class definitions with no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class declarations, each inheriting from a base exception. There are no input handling, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident. The classes are simple and serve as error types, typical for a Python package error handling mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign set of custom exception definitions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
