{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Py-EthPM package to handle various error scenarios.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance from base Exception class; no input data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no sensitive operations or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow involving untrusted data or external systems; primarily static class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a set of custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception, with clear docstrings. There are no dynamic behaviors, input handling, external calls, or sensitive operations present. The code is purely defining error types, which is common in Python packages for structured error handling. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for a Python package. It poses no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation concerns. The code is well-structured and typical for error handling in Python projects.",
