  "purpose": "The code provides functions for resolving URIs, creating content-addressed GitHub URIs, verifying supported URIs, generating block URIs, and checking if a chain matches a chain URI, primarily for blockchain data handling and validation.",
  "sources": "URI inputs in functions resolve_uri_contents, create_content_addressed_github_uri, is_supported_content_addressed_uri, create_latest_block_uri, check_if_chain_matches_chain_uri; network requests via requests.get in create_content_addressed_github_uri; data retrieval from web3 (blockchain data).",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data outputs in create_content_addressed_github_uri (returning git_url), create_latest_block_uri (block URI), and check_if_chain_matches_chain_uri (boolean).",
  "flows": "URI inputs are used to fetch data via network or blockchain, then processed or returned; especially in create_content_addressed_github_uri where JSON content is fetched, validated, and a git_url is extracted.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of requests.get and JSON parsing is standard. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The recursive call in resolve_uri_contents is typical for content resolution workflows. No obfuscated or misleading code structure.",
  "analysis": "The functions implement standard URI resolution and validation workflows for blockchain data. The network request in create_content_addressed_github_uri retrieves JSON content from GitHub API; it then extracts a git_url if the file type is correct. The resolution functions handle backends for content resolution. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code are present. The code primarily interacts with external APIs and blockchain data, which is typical for such utilities. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for blockchain URI handling and validation. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It handles network requests and blockchain data in a typical manner for this domain. Overall security risk is low.",
