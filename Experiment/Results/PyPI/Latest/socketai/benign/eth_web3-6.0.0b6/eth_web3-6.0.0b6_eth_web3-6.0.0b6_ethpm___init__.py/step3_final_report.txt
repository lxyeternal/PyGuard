  "purpose": "Defines directory paths relative to the current script and verifies the existence of a specific JSON spec file within the 'ethpm-spec' directory, raising an error if missing.",
  "sources": "Path(__file__).parent, Path(__file__).parent / 'assets', Path(__file__).parent / 'ethpm-spec' / 'spec' / 'v3.spec.json'",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "Path construction from __file__ to specific JSON file; check for file existence; raise exception if not found.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward path setup and file existence check; no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up directory paths based on the script location, then verifies the presence of a specific JSON file. It raises a clear error with instructions if the file is missing. No untrusted input, external calls, or data leaks are involved. The code is typical for setup routines, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The only potential concern is reliance on a specific file existing, but this is standard in package setup scripts. The exception message provides guidance for environment setup but does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard directory and file validation during setup. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minimal risk is related to environment setup instructions, which are normal and not security concerns.",
