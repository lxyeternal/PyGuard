  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static configuration constants, with no functions, input handling, or dynamic code.\n- No external data sources, credentials, or secrets are present.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- The code appears to be standard for blockchain/IPFS projects.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Only defines constants related to blockchain and IPFS; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues found.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard configuration constants.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—static configuration constants.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Static configuration, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Again, static constants, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- **Security risk score:** All are 0, appropriate given the static nature and lack of secrets or external calls.\n- **Confidence:** Perfect (1) in all cases.\n\n**Are any scores unreasonable?**  \nNo. The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code is purely static configuration; no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n- The regex pattern is standard for package name validation.\n- The constants are typical for blockchain/IPFS projects.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** Remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as no security issues are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. The code is safe, standard configuration, with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
