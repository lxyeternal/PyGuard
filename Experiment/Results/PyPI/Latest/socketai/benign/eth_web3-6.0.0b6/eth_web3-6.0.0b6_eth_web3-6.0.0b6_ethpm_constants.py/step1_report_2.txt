{
  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration parameters for a blockchain-related package, including URI schemes, regex patterns, IPFS backend, gateway URLs, and supported chain IDs.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments and regex pattern definition; no external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling functions are present; no untrusted data processing or external outputs observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; purely static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static constant definitions, URL strings, and a regex pattern. No dynamic code execution, external data input, or suspicious logic is present. The constants relate to blockchain and IPFS configurations, which are typical in such projects. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscated code. All elements appear to serve configuration purposes, with no evidence of data leakage or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration module defining constants for blockchain, IPFS, and GitHub API settings. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
