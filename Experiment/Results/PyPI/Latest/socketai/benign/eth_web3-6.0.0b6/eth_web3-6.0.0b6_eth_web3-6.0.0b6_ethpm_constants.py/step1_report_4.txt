{
  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration parameters related to registry schemes, regex validation, IPFS backend, gateways, GitHub API, and supported blockchain network IDs.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments and regex pattern definitions, which do not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sink points such as data output, network requests, or external system calls are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code solely defines static constants and regex patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are evident. The constants are typical for blockchain or IPFS-related configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static configuration variables including URI schemes, a regex for package name validation, IPFS backend and gateway URLs, GitHub API authority, and a dictionary of supported blockchain network IDs. There are no input sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious or malicious patterns. The constants appear intended for legitimate functionality in a blockchain or IPFS-related project. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious code segments are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet contains only static configuration constants and patterns relevant to blockchain, IPFS, and GitHub integrations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and appears to be standard configuration code.",
