  "purpose": "Define configuration constants and patterns related to blockchain registry schemes, IPFS backends, gateways, GitHub API, and supported Ethereum chain IDs.",
  "sources": "Constants and regex pattern definitions; no input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling functions are present; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static constants used.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions and configuration parameters. There are no functions, no data input handling, no external calls, or dynamic code execution. The regex pattern is standard for name validation. The constants relate to known IPFS gateways, blockchain network IDs, and API endpoints, with no embedded secrets or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a static setup for blockchain and IPFS integration.",
