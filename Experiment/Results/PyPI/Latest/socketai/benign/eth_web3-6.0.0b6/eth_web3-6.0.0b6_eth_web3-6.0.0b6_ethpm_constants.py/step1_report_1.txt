{
  "purpose": "Define constants and configurations for blockchain and IPFS interactions, including registry schemes, regex patterns, IPFS backends, gateways, and supported chain IDs.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments and string literals assigned to variables; no external data sources or input reading detected.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no processing of untrusted data or external outputs that could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; all are static configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or suspicious variables observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines static constants related to blockchain protocols, IPFS backends, gateways, and supported network IDs. All values are hardcoded string literals and numeric keys. There are no functions, input handling, or data processing. The configuration appears standard and intended for use as constants within a larger application. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only configuration constants for blockchain and IPFS setup. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It appears to be safe and standard for a project handling blockchain and IPFS interactions.",
