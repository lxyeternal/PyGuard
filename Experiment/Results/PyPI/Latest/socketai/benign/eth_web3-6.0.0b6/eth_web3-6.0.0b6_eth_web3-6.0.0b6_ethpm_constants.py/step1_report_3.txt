{
  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration parameters for a package or application related to IPFS, Ethereum, and GitHub integrations.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals and numeric constants used for configuration (e.g., URI schemes, regex, IPFS backend, gateways, GitHub API, chain IDs).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "N/A - No dynamic data or untrusted input processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. Constants appear standard for configuration purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of defining static configuration constants such as URI schemes, regex patterns, URLs, and supported network IDs. There are no functions, input handling, or data processing logic. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present. All values appear consistent with intended use for blockchain or IPFS integrations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of configuration constants with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any code that performs untrusted data handling, secret management, or suspicious network activity.",
