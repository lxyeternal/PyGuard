  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static configuration constants, with no dynamic code, input handling, or external data processing.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The constants relate to blockchain schemes, IPFS, GitHub API, chain IDs, and regex validation, which are typical in such projects.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware are evident.\n\n**Specific issues:**\n- The code snippets do not contain any logic that could be exploited or that perform untrusted data handling.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is reasonable given the static nature and lack of sensitive data.\n\n**Score evaluation:**\n- The reports' scores seem reasonable and consistent with the findings.\n- Since no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are detected, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n- The detailed reasoning in each report supports the conclusion that the code is benign.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- Malware score: 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- Obfuscated score: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- Risk score: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is purely static configuration data with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
