  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as static configuration constants related to blockchain, IPFS, GitHub, and network IDs.\n- No external data sources, input handling, dynamic code, or processing logic are present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The constants are standard and appropriate for their intended use.\n\n**Specific issues:**\n- **Presence of issues in the code:** The code appears to be purely static configuration; no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Errors or flaws in the reports:** The reports are thorough and consistent; they correctly identify the nature of the code as static constants with no suspicious elements.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n  - Security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n  - Confidence levels are high (1), which makes sense given the static, non-malicious nature.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- The reports assume that constants are safe because they are static. This is valid; no evidence suggests otherwise.\n- The regex pattern for package names is standard and not suspicious.\n- The IPFS and blockchain configurations are typical and do not contain secrets or backdoors.\n\n**Consistency and justification:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No report suggests any malicious intent or security concern that warrants a higher risk or malware score.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0, since there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0, given the static, standard nature of the code.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a straightforward set of configuration constants with no signs of malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, standard configuration, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- Scores assigned are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
