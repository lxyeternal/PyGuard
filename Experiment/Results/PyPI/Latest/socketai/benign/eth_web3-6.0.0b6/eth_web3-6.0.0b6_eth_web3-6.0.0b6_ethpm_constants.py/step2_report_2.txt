  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code and the reasoning, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code consists solely of static constants: URI schemes, regex patterns, URLs, network IDs, etc.\n- No functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n- No external data sources, credentials, or secrets embedded.\n- The constants are typical for blockchain/IPFS configuration.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The actual code provided matches the descriptions in all reports.\n- No issues or anomalies are present in the code snippets.\n- The reasoning in each report correctly identifies the code as purely configuration with no malicious intent.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No flaws are evident in the reasoning. All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the static, harmless nature of the code.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is correct.\n- Obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with the straightforward string literals.\n- Security risk scores are zero, as there are no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since all reports assign zero to malware and security risk, and the code is just configuration, there's no justification for higher scores.\n- The code does not perform any network requests, data handling, or secret management that could pose security risks.\n\n### Malware considerations:\n- No malicious activity detected or implied.\n- The code is purely static configuration data.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities:\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code does not contain logic that could be exploited.\n- The regex pattern for package name validation is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign configuration constants with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reasoning and scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code appears safe, standard, and free of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
