  "purpose": "Static configuration constants for blockchain schemes, IPFS, GitHub API, and network IDs used in a Python project.",
  "sources": "Definitions of URI schemes, regex patterns, URLs, and network ID mappings.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; constants are used as static configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or processing logic; constants are referenced elsewhere in the project.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of static string and numeric constants with standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static configuration data, including URI schemes, regex for package names, URLs for IPFS and GitHub, and network ID mappings. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The constants are typical for blockchain and IPFS integrations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The regex pattern is standard, and the URLs are publicly accessible. The overall structure and content are safe and appropriate for their intended purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static configuration constants with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All analyses and scores are consistent with its benign, standard nature.",
