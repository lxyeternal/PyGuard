{
  "purpose": "The code loads JSON manifest files from specific directories related to ethpm specifications and local assets.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from file paths constructed using get_ethpm_spec_dir() and ASSETS_DIR, based on provided use_case and filename parameters.",
  "sinks": "The data is parsed using json.loads, which processes the content of the files. No untrusted data is sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input: use_case and filename parameters → file path construction → read_text() → json.loads()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors observed. Usage of directory paths appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The functions retrieve JSON data from specified directories, relying on external functions and variables for path resolution. There is no user input processing beyond function parameters, and no network activity or data exfiltration observed. The code is simple, with no apparent malicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for loading JSON manifests from designated directories. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The functions are safe, assuming get_ethpm_spec_dir() and ASSETS_DIR are secure and controlled.",
