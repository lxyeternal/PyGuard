{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to read JSON manifest files from specific directories related to EthPM specifications and local assets.",
  "sources": "The code reads files from directories returned by get_ethpm_spec_dir() and ASSETS_DIR, using filenames and use case parameters provided as input.",
  "sinks": "The file reading operations could potentially lead to reading untrusted files if input parameters are maliciously manipulated, but no direct sink for executing or transmitting data exists.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (use_case, filename) influence file paths, which are then read and parsed into JSON objects.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs file reading based on input parameters without validation or sanitization, which could potentially lead to directory traversal if get_ethpm_spec_dir() or ASSETS_DIR are insecurely configured.",
  "analysis": "The functions rely on external functions and variables to determine file paths. They read and parse JSON files directly from those paths. No code injection or execution is present. The use of path concatenation appears safe assuming get_ethpm_spec_dir() and ASSETS_DIR are secure, but there is a potential risk if these are compromised. The code itself is straightforward and does not include obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple file reader for JSON manifests with no malicious behavior detected. It could pose a risk if directory traversal or path manipulation is possible via the input parameters, but as written, it does not contain malicious code or malware.",
