{
  "purpose": "Load JSON manifest files from specified directories based on use case and filename parameters.",
  "sources": "External functions get_ethpm_spec_dir() and constants ASSETS_DIR, used to construct file paths; parameters use_case and filename used as input to build paths.",
  "sinks": "Reading files via read_text() and parsing with json.loads(); no direct data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Constructed file paths from external functions/constants and parameters, then read and parse JSON content.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation or malicious code detected; potential lack of input validation for parameters could lead to directory traversal if external inputs are malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file reading and JSON parsing without executing code or network activity. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The main security concern is if external functions or parameters are manipulated to access unintended files, which could lead to directory traversal. The code itself is safe, and the JSON parsing is standard. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate. The risk could slightly increase if external inputs are untrusted, but as-is, the code is low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe utility for loading JSON files from specific directories. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The minor security risk pertains to potential path manipulation if external inputs are uncontrolled, but this is outside the code's direct logic. Overall, the code is secure and appropriate for its purpose.",
