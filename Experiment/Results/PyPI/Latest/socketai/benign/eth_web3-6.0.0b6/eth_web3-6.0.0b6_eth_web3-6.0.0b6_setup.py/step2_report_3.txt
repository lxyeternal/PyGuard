  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the script is a standard setup.py for a Python package, with no suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code. It notes the absence of untrusted data handling, code injection, or external command execution.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are both 0, which is appropriate. Security risk is low (0.1), considering it's a package setup script.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound, and the scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it confirms the script is a typical setup configuration with explicit dependencies and no malicious behaviors. It emphasizes the absence of suspicious code patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is minimal.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, confirms the script's role in package configuration with no signs of malicious activity. It highlights the explicit dependencies and the reading of README.md as standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is negligible.\n- **Verdict:** Well-founded.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates the standard nature of the setup script, with no suspicious behaviors or obfuscation. Reads README.md, defines dependencies, and calls setup() in a typical manner.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is low.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, confirms the script's role in package setup with no signs of malicious activity. Notes the absence of untrusted data handling and suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0.1, which is reasonable given the context.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code presence:** The code is a straightforward `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; no code injection, obfuscated code, or external command execution.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, as this is a package configuration script with no runtime code execution or untrusted input handling.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate. The security risk scores are also reasonable, given the context.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, standard package setup risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
