{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring dependencies, metadata, and package data for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads package dependencies, package metadata, and the README file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or untrusted input processing are present.",
  "flows": "Reads dependencies and package info, then uses setuptools.setup() to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic; dependencies are standard for a Python project. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools modules, defines extras_require with various optional dependencies, reads the README.md file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. The dependencies are version-locked and appropriate for the project. The code adheres to standard packaging practices without any dynamic code execution, suspicious file reads, or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It solely manages package configuration and dependencies. No malware or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
