  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the actual code, and then synthesize an overall evaluation.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns are identified; dependencies are typical and explicitly listed.\n- The code reads a README.md file for the long description, which is standard practice.\n- No untrusted input, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code is present.\n- The only potential concern is the securityRisk score of 0.1 in some reports, which seems to be a default or conservative estimate rather than indicating actual risk.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is a typical setup script; no issues with the code's functionality or logic.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None based on static analysis.\n\n### Evaluation of Scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0.0, consistent with the code.\n- **Risk score:** Most reports assign 0.0 or 0.1, which is reasonable given the absence of any malicious or risky behavior.\n\n### Justification for any higher risk scores:\n- Since the code is a standard setup script with no dynamic or untrusted input, a risk score higher than 0.1 is unwarranted.\n- The only minor point is the reading of README.md, which is safe and standard.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- The slight variation in the securityRisk score (0.1 vs. 0) is acceptable, perhaps reflecting a conservative default.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n| Score Type     | Recommended Value | Justification                                               |\n|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | **0.0**           | No malicious code or behavior detected.                     |\n| Obfuscated     | **0.0**           | Clear, straightforward code.                                |\n| Security Risk  | **0.0**           | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.                      |\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe setup script is a standard, well-structured package configuration file with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The reported scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis reflects a safe, typical setup script with no security concerns.",
