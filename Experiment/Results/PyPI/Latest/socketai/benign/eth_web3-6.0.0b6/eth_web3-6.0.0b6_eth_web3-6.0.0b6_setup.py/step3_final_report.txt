{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring dependencies, metadata, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; defines dependencies within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external command executions; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and defines static dependencies; no dynamic or untrusted data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file, specifies dependencies with explicit version constraints, and calls setup() with metadata. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. The dependencies are typical for a web3-related package, and the code structure is straightforward. The minimal security risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports is justified by the inherent low risk of setup scripts, which do not execute untrusted code at runtime.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured package setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All assessments correctly identify the absence of malware, obfuscation, and significant security risks.",
