{
  "purpose": "Provide a class for managing and accessing deployed smart contract data and instances.",
  "sources": "Inputs from deployment_data and contract_instances dictionaries, user-provided keys for lookup.",
  "sinks": "Dictionary access via keys, validation functions, and potential exception raising.",
  "flows": "User supplies contract names to get() or get_instance(), which triggers validation and dictionary lookups.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed. Use of validation functions is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes to manage deployment data and contract instances, with standard validation and access patterns. The validation relies on external function 'validate_contract_name' but does not incorporate unsafe or malicious code. No external data is directly fetched or transmitted. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic detected. The code appears to be a typical deployment data management utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward deployment data manager with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It relies on external validation, but the core logic is standard and safe.",
