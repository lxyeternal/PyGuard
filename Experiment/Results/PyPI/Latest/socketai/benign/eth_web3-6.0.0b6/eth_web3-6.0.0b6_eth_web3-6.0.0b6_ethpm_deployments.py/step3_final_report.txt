  "purpose": "Manage deployment data and contract instances with validation in an Ethereum context.",
  "sources": "deployment_data, contract_instances, validate_contract_name function",
  "sinks": "None; data is handled in-memory with validation, no external sinks or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Validation occurs during get and get_instance calls; data flows from internal storage through validation to return.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard validation and data access patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility class for managing deployment data and contract instances, performing validation via an external function. It does not execute external commands, handle untrusted input beyond internal method calls, or contain obfuscation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The data management is in-memory, and validation is external and presumed safe. The code structure is clear, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk in such data handling code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for deployment data management with proper validation. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure elements are present. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
