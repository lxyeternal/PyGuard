  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration and check for dependencies installation",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, the import statements, and the file handling code at the end",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'dependencies.txt' and the import statements (which could be considered untrusted input handling if dependencies were dynamic)",
  "flows": "Import dependencies -> write installation status to file",
  "anomalies": "The dependency check is a simple import attempt with no security measures; no malicious code execution or data exfiltration is evident. The comment about checking dependencies was not followed by actual dynamic dependency management. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script performs static package setup using distutils without executing any malicious code. It attempts to import cryptography and requests modules to verify installation status, then writes the result to a text file. This is a benign, standard practice for verifying dependencies, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data theft, code injection, or reverse shells. The only minor concern is the simplistic dependency check, but it does not pose a security risk. The overall code structure is clear and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a dependency check. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The dependency check is basic and harmless, with no suspicious data handling or malicious intent.",
