{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration and performs a basic dependency check by attempting to import specific modules and writing the status to a file.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'cryptography' and 'requests'; file open and write operations for 'dependencies.txt'.",
  "sinks": "Writing dependency check results to 'dependencies.txt' (a local file).",
  "flows": "Import modules -> check import success -> write status to 'dependencies.txt'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup using 'distutils' and a simple dependency check by importing modules and writing the outcome to a file. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The dependency check is superficial but harmless. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident. The code is clear and follows typical patterns for such scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup script with a minimal dependency check, posing no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are justified and appropriate.",
