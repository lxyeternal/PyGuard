  "purpose": "A simple Java code linter that checks for proper class declaration, method naming, and variable naming conventions.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'code' (the Java source code string), regex pattern matching lines of code.",
  "sinks": "Appending to the 'errors' list when issues are found during pattern matches.",
  "flows": "Reads the input code, splits into lines, applies regex checks, and records errors based on pattern mismatches.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code performs straightforward regex pattern matching for style enforcement without any suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static code analysis tool focusing on style guidelines for Java code. It uses regex to validate class names, method names, and variable names, appending error messages when deviations are detected. There is no indication of dynamic code execution, data leakage, or malicious behavior. It operates purely on pattern matching. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or system modifications are present. It is a simple, non-malicious style checker.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis tool for Java code style enforcement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
