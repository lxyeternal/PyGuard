{
  "purpose": "A Java code linter designed to check for proper class declarations, method naming conventions, and variable naming conventions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input Java source code as a string passed to the 'lint' method.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code takes input string, splits into lines, applies regex checks, and logs errors based on pattern mismatches.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and solely for static code analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'JavaCodeLinter' with methods for checking Java code style. It uses regex patterns to verify class names start with uppercase, method names follow camelCase, and variable names follow camelCase. Checks are performed line-by-line without executing code or handling untrusted input in any risky way. No external data sources or network interactions are involved. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis tool for Java code style enforcement. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks. The code is safe and purpose-driven with no indication of malicious intent.",
