{
  "purpose": "A Java code linter that checks for proper class declaration, method naming, and variable naming conventions.",
  "sources": "Reads input Java code as a string to analyze class declarations, method definitions, and variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains direct sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The code analyzes each line for specific patterns related to class names, method names, and variable names but does not process untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regular expressions to enforce naming conventions; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior detected. No dynamic code execution or external communication.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static pattern matching to verify Java naming conventions and class declarations. It iterates through each line to find potential violations based on regex patterns. No external inputs or outputs are involved that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity. The code structure and logic are straightforward and standard for a linter tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis tool aimed at enforcing coding standards for Java code. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are evident. It simply checks code style compliance.",
