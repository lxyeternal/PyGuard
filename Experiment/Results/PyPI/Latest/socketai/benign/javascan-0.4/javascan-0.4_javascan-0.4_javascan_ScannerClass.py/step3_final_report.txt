  "purpose": "A static Java style checker that enforces naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables using regex pattern matching.",
  "sources": "Reads each line of the provided Java code to identify class declarations, method signatures, and variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute code; the code only performs pattern matching and error logging.",
  "flows": "Source lines (class declaration, method signature, variable assignment) are matched against regex patterns; errors are logged if patterns are violated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with clear regex patterns for style enforcement. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static pattern matching for style enforcement without executing or handling untrusted data. It uses regex to verify class names start with uppercase, method names follow camelCase, and variables follow camelCase. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are evident. The regex patterns are simple and serve only style purposes. The code does not perform any external communication, dynamic code execution, or data processing beyond pattern matching. All signals indicate benign, style-only enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static style checker with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It enforces naming conventions via regex without executing code or handling untrusted data. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with its purpose and behavior.",
