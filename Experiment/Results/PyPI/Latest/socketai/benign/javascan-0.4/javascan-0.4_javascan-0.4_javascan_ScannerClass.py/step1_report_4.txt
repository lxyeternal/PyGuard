{
  "purpose": "A Java code linter designed to enforce coding standards such as class, method, and variable naming conventions.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'code' (string containing Java source code). No other data sources or external inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "Appended error messages in self.errors list; no untrusted data outputs, network operations, or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Code is split into lines, analyzed against regex patterns, and errors are collected in self.errors. No flow involves untrusted data leading to harmful effects.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward; no suspicious or unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or malicious logic present. All patterns are standard for a linter.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a class with methods that analyze Java source code for naming conventions using regex patterns. It checks class declarations for proper naming, method names for camelCase, and variable names for camelCase. The code operates purely through pattern matching and error logging, with no external or suspicious activities. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malware. The logic is clear, and no anomalies indicating sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign Java style linter focusing on naming conventions. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. Its purpose is to enforce coding standards without any harmful intent.",
