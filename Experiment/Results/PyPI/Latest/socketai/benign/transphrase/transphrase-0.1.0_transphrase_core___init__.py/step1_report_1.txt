  "purpose": "Defines core functionality, configuration, constants, and base components for the TransPhrase translation system.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, output functions, or external data transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identifiable in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only metadata (version string) and descriptive comments; no suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a docstring comment, a version assignment, and no other logic. It does not include any input handling, data processing, or external communication. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks. The absence of executable logic limits any security concern assessment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign component providing metadata and structure for a translation system. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
