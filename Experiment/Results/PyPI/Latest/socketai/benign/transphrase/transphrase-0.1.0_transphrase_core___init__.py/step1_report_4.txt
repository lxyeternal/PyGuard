  "sinks": "No data leaks, untrusted data handling, or security-sensitive operations observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified as there are no input or processing flows.",
  "anomalies": "Only metadata and comments, no suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of comments, a version string, and descriptive comments about the module's purpose. It does not perform any data processing, input handling, or system interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. It appears to be a standard, benign module header or stub for a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a documentation or initialization placeholder for the translation system. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
