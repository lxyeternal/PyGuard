  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leaks or malicious data flows are evident.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a comment, a version string, and a descriptive comment; no executable or suspicious code is present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is minimal, containing only a comment block describing the module's purpose, a version variable, and a comment. It does not include any logic, data input/output, or code execution. Without additional code, there are no identifiable sources, sinks, or flows. The code appears to be a standard header or module descriptor for a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation in this code snippet. It is a simple descriptive header without executable or sensitive components.",
