{
  "purpose": "Handles file processing operations for translation, including reading text files, chunking large texts, calling an API for translation, and updating a database with translation status.",
  "sources": "Reads input text files via Path.read_text(), reads configuration variables, accesses database models for job and file records.",
  "sinks": "Writes translated text to output files via Path.write_text(), updates database records for translation status, logs progress and errors.",
  "flows": "Reads text files -> splits into chunks -> API calls for translation -> joins translated chunks -> writes output files -> updates database records for each file -> updates job status upon completion.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity or data leaks. API handler is a black box but used normally.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file translation operations with proper error handling, progress reporting, and optional database integration. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The API call is a black box but assumed legitimate. Chunking logic is straightforward. Database interactions are typical for tracking progress.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate translation utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are justified based on the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
