  "purpose": "Handles API interactions for model listing and translation, including caching and rate limiting.",
  "sources": "API responses, cache lookups, environment variables for API key, configuration for base URL",
  "sinks": "API responses, cache storage, potential network calls to external URL",
  "flows": "API key used for authentication; model info fetched; translation request sent; responses cached",
  "anomalies": "Use of a non-standard API URL ('https://api.electronhub.top'), but no malicious code or backdoors detected",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard practices for API interaction, including retries, caching, and rate limiting. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. The external API URL is unusual but not inherently malicious; external verification is recommended. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are detected. The logic flow is straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The only external concern is the custom API URL, which warrants external verification but does not indicate malicious activity within the code itself. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2 due to the external URL domain.",
