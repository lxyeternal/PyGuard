  "purpose": "The code is intended to handle communication with language model APIs for translation purposes within the TransPhrase project.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading operations are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or operations that process untrusted input are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks are evident, as the code does not include executable logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a brief module docstring, a version variable, and no functional or suspicious code segments. No hardcoded credentials, malicious behavior, or obfuscation is visible.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of a descriptive comment, a version string, and no executable logic or external data interactions. This makes it unlikely to contain malicious behavior or security risks. Since there is no operational code, no sources, sinks, or flows can be identified. The absence of any suspicious activity or obfuscation further suggests this is benign boilerplate or documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple, benign module header with no apparent malicious behavior, data handling, or security risks. It appears to be a placeholder or documentation comment for a larger module. Based on this snippet alone, there are no security concerns.",
