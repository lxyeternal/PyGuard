{
  "purpose": "Minimal setup script for Python packaging relying on external configuration in pyproject.toml.",
  "sources": "Import from setuptools and call setup() with no arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is static and does not process data.",
  "anomalies": "Calling setup() with no arguments is unusual but standard when configuration is externalized; no suspicious patterns or code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, minimal setup script that delegates configuration to external files. It contains no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores. The reliance on external configuration does not introduce security concerns in the code itself. The code aligns with modern packaging practices and shows no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and secure. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
