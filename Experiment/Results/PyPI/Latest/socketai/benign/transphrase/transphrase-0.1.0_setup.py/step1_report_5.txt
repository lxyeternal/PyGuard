{
  "purpose": "The code is used to configure a Python package setup, delegating configuration details to an external pyproject.toml file.",
  "sources": "Importing from 'setuptools' and calling 'setup()' function",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as the code only calls a setup function with no arguments",
  "anomalies": "Absence of configuration parameters or dynamic code; no signs of obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and executes 'setup()' without arguments, relying on external configuration. This is a minimal and standard pattern for modern Python packaging. There are no hardcoded credentials, environment variable misuse, or malicious code patterns. The code itself does not process user input or handle sensitive data. It is a typical setup script that delegates configuration to 'pyproject.toml'.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, non-malicious minimal setup invocation. It contains no suspicious activity, no malicious code, and poses no security risk.",
