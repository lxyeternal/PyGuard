  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code snippet: a call to `setup()` with no arguments, relying on external configuration (`pyproject.toml`).\n- No evidence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, malicious code, or data processing.\n- The code is standard for modern Python packaging practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code itself does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- No data flows, no input/output, no embedded secrets.\n- All reports correctly identify that configuration is externalized.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- None of the reports claim any actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent. They all agree the code is benign.\n- The only \"anomaly\" noted is the call to `setup()` with no arguments, which is standard practice when configuration is in `pyproject.toml`.\n- No false positives or logical errors are apparent.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correct as the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** mostly 0, with a minor 0.1 in report 2, which seems reasonable given the context.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are 0 or very close.\n- The minimal code and external configuration mean no direct security threat.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The reports do not consider the possibility that the external configuration (`pyproject.toml`) could be malicious or compromised. While the code snippet itself is safe, if `pyproject.toml` is malicious, the overall package could be harmful.\n- However, since the review focuses solely on this code snippet, and no details about external files are provided, this cannot be assessed here.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the described code and its benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk evident from the code snippet)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, minimal setup script relying on external configuration. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior based on its content. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If considering the broader context, the security of the package also depends on the integrity of `pyproject.toml` and the environment, but this is outside the scope of this code review.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- No changes needed; the code is benign.",
