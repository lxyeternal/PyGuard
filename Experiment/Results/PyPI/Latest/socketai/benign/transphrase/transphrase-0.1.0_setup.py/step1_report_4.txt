  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package using setuptools, with configuration moved to pyproject.toml.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only static function call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or sensitive data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; function call without parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; setup() called with no arguments, relying on external configuration. No suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setup function from setuptools and calls setup() with no arguments, indicating configuration is handled via pyproject.toml. There are no embedded secrets, no data input/output, and no suspicious logic. The code appears to be a minimal, standard setup script for packaging, with configuration externalized. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code flow.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, minimal setup script that delegates configuration to pyproject.toml. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security concerns are evident.",
