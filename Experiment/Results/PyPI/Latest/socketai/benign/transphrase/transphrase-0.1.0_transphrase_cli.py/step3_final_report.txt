  "purpose": "Command-line interface for configuring and executing translation and rephrasing tasks, managing user inputs, environment variables, plugins, and processing files.",
  "sources": "User prompts for directories, API key from environment variable, plugin templates, model selection, prompt type, worker count, and skip options.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable 'MASTER_API_KEY' used for API authentication; no untrusted data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Source: environment variable and user input -> API handler and plugin system -> file processing components.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI setup that securely manages API keys via environment variables, prompts for configuration, initializes core components, and processes files. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and typical security considerations for such tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured open-source CLI utility for translation tasks. No malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The scores and assessments are justified and align with the code's functionality.",
