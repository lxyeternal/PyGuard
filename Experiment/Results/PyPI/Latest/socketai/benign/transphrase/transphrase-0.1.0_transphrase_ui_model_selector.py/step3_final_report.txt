  "purpose": "Interactive CLI tool for selecting models, fetching available models via API, and handling user input for navigation and search.",
  "sources": "API fetch for available models, user input via readchar, console output via rich for display and details.",
  "sinks": "Display output to console, user input handling; no external data leaks or network activity beyond API fetch.",
  "flows": "API fetch provides model data; user input modifies search term and navigation; selected model is returned; display updates reflect current state.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected. Code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard CLI for model selection with real-time search and navigation. It fetches models via API, displays them in a formatted table, and allows user interaction for selection or default fallback. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data exfiltration are present. The logic is clear, with proper handling of user input, filtering, and display. External API usage is legitimate, and console output is typical for CLI tools. No vulnerabilities or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured CLI application for model selection. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, no obfuscation, and poses minimal security risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
