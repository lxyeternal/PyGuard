{
  "purpose": "Provides an interactive command-line interface for selecting models from an available list fetched via an API, with search and navigation features.",
  "sources": "Reads user keyboard input through readchar.readkey() and fetches model data via self.api_handler.fetch_available_models().",
  "sinks": "Uses console.print for output display; no untrusted data is written to files, network, or environment variables; no data is sent externally.",
  "flows": "User inputs (navigation, search) influence the selected model index; input handling updates filtered list and selection; model data is retrieved from API but not transmitted externally.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears standard; no suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, or hidden backdoors. No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, or misleading variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The script implements a standard interactive CLI for model selection with search and navigation. It fetches models from an API, filters them based on user input, and displays detailed info. Input handling via readchar.readkey() is used solely for user interface control. No evidence of malicious code, such as network data exfiltration, code injection, or access to sensitive data. All operations are confined to local console interaction, with no external data transmission. The only external interaction is the API call for models, which is a legitimate dependency and usage. There are no signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign, user-interface function for model selection with no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It is a standard implementation with appropriate handling, no suspicious activities, and no malicious payloads.",
