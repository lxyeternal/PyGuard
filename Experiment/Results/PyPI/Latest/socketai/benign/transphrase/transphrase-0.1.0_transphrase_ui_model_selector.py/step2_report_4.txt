  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the provided code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Benign, straightforward CLI for model selection. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code is standard, with no network activity beyond fetching models. The risk score is appropriately low.\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar benign assessment, with mention that console output could be exploited if terminal handling is compromised, but no actual malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The mention of console.print() as a potential vector is overly cautious; in typical use, this is safe. The code does not perform any dangerous operations. The small securityRisk score (0.1) is acceptable given the minimal potential surface.\n- **Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. The reasoning aligns with the code's operations.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same benign, standard CLI for model selection, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous assessments; no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Scores and reasoning are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar benign assessment, emphasizing no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is thorough and aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a benign CLI with no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- All reports consistently identify the code as benign.\n- Malware scores are all zero, which is justified; no malicious code or behavior is present.\n- Obfuscation scores are zero; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1), reflecting minimal potential surface area, mainly related to console output and user input handling, which are standard in CLI tools.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minor risk due to reliance on external API and user input, but nothing suspicious.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The scores are appropriate given the code's functionality and structure. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code is a benign, well-structured CLI tool with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
