  "purpose": "Module setup for a Python-based web novel translation application, importing core components and setting version info.",
  "sources": "Import statements from transphrase.api.handler, transphrase.core.config, and transphrase.core.file_processor",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only static imports and version declaration",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of a version string and import statements for core modules. No network activity, data processing, or user input handling is evident. The imported modules could handle sensitive data, but no such activity is shown here. The code is straightforward and benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign module setup with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified, reflecting the safe and straightforward nature of this minimal code fragment.",
