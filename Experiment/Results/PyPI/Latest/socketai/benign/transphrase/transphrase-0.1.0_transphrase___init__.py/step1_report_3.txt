  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling, network communication, or data exfiltration are present",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code does not show data flow, input handling, or output processing beyond imports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or obfuscated patterns are present; the code is straightforward and well-structured",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic module header with descriptive comments, version info, and import statements. It imports core components likely used for handling API requests, configuration, and file processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden code, or suspicious activity. The absence of network operations or sensitive data handling suggests low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard application setup with no indications of malicious intent or security issues. It is well-structured, with no suspicious or anomalous elements.",
