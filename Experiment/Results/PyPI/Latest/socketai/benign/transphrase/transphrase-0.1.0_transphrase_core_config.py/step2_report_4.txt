  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious code, static configuration, no dynamic data flow, no hardcoded secrets. The code is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, static configuration, no suspicious patterns. The only potential concern is the `api_key` placeholder and the default URL, but these are standard in configuration files.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.95.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity detected. The slight security risk is just due to the presence of an API key placeholder and a default URL, which is typical in configs.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—static configuration, no suspicious code, no dynamic execution. The default URL is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no suspicious patterns, configuration-only code. User inputs like `api_key` and `db_path` are expected to be supplied at runtime.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above—standard configuration, no suspicious activity. Slight concern about the default API URL, but not suspicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.95.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malware (score 0). The code is purely configuration and prompt templates.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate no obfuscation (score 0).\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (~0.1) in some reports due to default URLs and placeholders, which is typical and not malicious.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward, static, and readable.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, related to default URLs and placeholders, which is standard in configuration files.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n\n- No suspicious code patterns, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets beyond placeholders.\n- The code is a standard configuration module for a translation system.\n- The only minor concern is the default URL, which should be verified for trustworthiness, but that does not constitute a security risk per se.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, benign, and does not contain malware or obfuscation. The small security risk score is justified by the presence of default URLs and placeholders, but nothing malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis across all reports.",
