  "purpose": "Configuration management for TransPhrase, including translation and editing settings.",
  "sources": "Import statements, constant definitions, dataclass fields, and default prompt strings.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed; configuration values are static or set by user input at runtime.",
  "flows": "User-provided sensitive data (e.g., api_key, db_path) flows into configuration objects; no untrusted data flows into critical functions or external calls within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials (other than default API keys, which are not necessarily malicious), no suspicious external calls, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines configuration data structures for translation and polishing processes, including default prompts, constants, and data classes. It imports standard libraries and a specific RateLimitConfig class. The configuration parameters include API keys, directory paths, and other settings; none of these involve dynamic evaluation or potentially malicious code. The default prompts are static string constants, and no code appears to perform network operations, file I/O beyond path definitions, or other sensitive actions. The overall structure appears standard for a configuration module, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup for a translation system, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on external inputs at runtime but does not process or execute untrusted data within this snippet. There are no anomalies or malware indicators observed.",
