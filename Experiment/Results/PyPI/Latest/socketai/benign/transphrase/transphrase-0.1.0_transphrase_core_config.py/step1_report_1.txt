{
  "purpose": "Configuration management for TransPhrase, including translation and polishing prompts, constants, and data class for translation settings.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (dataclasses, pathlib, typing), external module (transphrase.rate_limiting.rate_limiter), and module-level constant definitions and string variables.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data, as the code does not include I/O operations, network calls, or data processing involving external inputs.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code defines static configurations and constants without dynamic data flow or input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code primarily consists of static configuration variables, string prompts, and data class definitions with no dynamic or potentially malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration module for a translation tool. It imports necessary modules, defines constants, and creates a data class for configuration parameters. The strings provided are static prompts for translation and polishing tasks, which are meant for user guidance. There are no functions, user inputs, network operations, or code execution routines that could be exploited. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data are present. Overall, the code appears to serve a benign purpose related to configuration and prompt management, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration module with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly defines constants, prompts, and a data class for managing translation settings. There are no indications of malware, backdoors, data leakage, or suspicious activities.",
