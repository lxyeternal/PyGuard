  "purpose": "Configuration management for TransPhrase, including translation and polishing prompts and parameters.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (dataclasses, pathlib, typing), external module transphrase.rate_limiting.rate_limiter, and hardcoded constants and default prompt strings.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data; the code only defines data structures and constants without executing untrusted input or network operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code merely sets default configurations and static prompts.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets (other than the default URL, which is a constant). No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors. The code appears to be straightforward configuration and prompt text definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines configuration dataclasses, constants, and default prompt strings for translation and polishing functions within a translation project. It imports necessary modules and references an external RateLimitConfig class, but does not perform any network operations, data processing, or untrusted input handling. All values are static or predefined, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code structure and format are standard, with no obfuscated or misleading elements.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical configuration module containing no malicious code or security risks. It does not process untrusted data, perform network actions, or include any suspicious patterns. The only minor concern is the default API URL, which should be verified for trustworthiness, but it is a static constant. Overall, the code is safe and not malicious.",
