  "purpose": "Configuration management for TransPhrase, including translation and polishing prompts, and settings for API usage.",
  "sources": "Imports from transphrase.rate_limiting.rate_limiter, constants, and dataclass definitions, as well as string variables for prompts.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or untrusted input; no code execution or data leakage mechanisms are apparent.",
  "flows": "The code defines configuration data structures and constants, with no dynamic data flows from sources to sinks that could cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. Use of default API URL and paths appears standard. No obfuscated or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes configuration parameters for translation and polishing processes, including API keys, paths, model identifiers, and prompt texts. It uses standard Python features such as dataclasses, type annotations, and default values. There are no indications of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code appears to be standard configuration code intended for setting up a translation system. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns are present. The only potential concern is the default API URL, which is a custom domain, but this alone is not suspicious without further context.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard configuration module for a translation system, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly defines constants, data classes, and prompts for use by the application, with no external data handling or code execution risks.",
