  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is static configuration, prompts, constants, and data classes.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or untrusted data processing are present.\n- The only potentially sensitive element is the `api_key` placeholder and the default URL (`https://api.electronhub.top`), which are standard in configuration files.\n- No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- The malware scores are consistently zero, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is reasonable given the static configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Issues in code:** No issues are present. The code is straightforward and static.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — correct, no malicious code.\n  - Security risk: mostly 0 or 0.1 — appropriate, minor concern about default URL.\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities:** None are based on assumptions; all observations are consistent with static configuration.\n- **Consistency:** Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis & Recommendations:\n\n- The reports are thorough and accurate; no modifications needed.\n- The only minor point is the default URL (`https://api.electronhub.top`). While not malicious, it should be verified for trustworthiness, but this is standard practice in configuration files.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malware.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, mainly due to the default URL and placeholder API key, which are typical in configs.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a benign configuration module with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to generate a consolidated final report or any specific recommendations?**",
