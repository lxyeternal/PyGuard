  "purpose": "Static configuration and prompt templates for translation and polishing operations in the TransPhrase system.",
  "sources": "Constants, data class fields, and default prompt strings; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to untrusted sinks or external systems within this code.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and well-structured. The only notable elements are placeholders for API keys and URLs, which are standard in configuration files.",
  "analysis": "The code defines configuration data classes, constants, and default prompts for translation and polishing tasks. It does not include dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. The presence of placeholders for API keys and URLs is typical and not suspicious. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious intent. The security risk score is minimal (around 0.1) due to default URLs and placeholders, which are common in configuration files but should be verified before deployment. Overall, the code is benign, static, and intended for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module with no malicious behavior or security issues. The scores are consistent with its static and straightforward nature. Minor security considerations regarding placeholders are acceptable and do not indicate any malicious intent.",
