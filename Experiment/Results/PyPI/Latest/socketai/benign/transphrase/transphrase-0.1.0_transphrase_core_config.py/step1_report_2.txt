  "purpose": "Configuration management and prompt templates for the TransPhrase translation system.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions, class definitions, import statements, and string prompt templates.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data flows involving untrusted input, as all data appears to be static or configuration-based.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicative of malicious activity; the code primarily sets static configurations and templates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials (apart from the api_key field intended for user input), and no dynamic code execution. The default database path uses a user directory expansion (~/.transphrase/transphrase.db), which is standard and not malicious. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines configuration data structures and static string templates for translation and polishing prompts. It imports standard modules and a RateLimitConfig class from an external module. There are no functions executing untrusted data or performing network operations. The only potentially sensitive element is the 'api_key' attribute, which is a placeholder to be supplied at runtime. All other values are static, and the code is mainly declarative. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, no external data handling, no hardcoded secrets beyond expected placeholders.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration and prompt template setup for a translation system. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior identified. It is a standard, well-structured configuration module with no security risks inherent in its static content.",
