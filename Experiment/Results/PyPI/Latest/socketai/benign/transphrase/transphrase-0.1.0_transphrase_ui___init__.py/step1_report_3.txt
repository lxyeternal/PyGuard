  "anomalies": "Lack of actual code implementation; only descriptive comments and version variable.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment describing UI components and a version string. There are no functions, data inputs, or outputs. The absence of executable or data-processing code means there are no potential security issues or malicious behaviors present. The code appears to be a placeholder or documentation snippet without active logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no executable logic, data handling, or suspicious patterns. It is a benign description of UI components with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
