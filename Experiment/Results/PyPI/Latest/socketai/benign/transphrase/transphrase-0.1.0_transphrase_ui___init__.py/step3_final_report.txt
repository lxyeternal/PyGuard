  "purpose": "This code serves as documentation or placeholder content describing UI components for TransPhrase, with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "No input sources; only comments and a version string.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions; code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code contains only static comments and a version variable.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, functions, or data handling; only descriptive comments and a version string.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of comments and a version string, with no functions, data processing, or external interactions. No suspicious patterns, malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code appears to be documentation or scaffolding for UI components, not functional logic. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, with high confidence. No anomalies or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely documentation-like, and poses no security threat. The current scores are accurate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
