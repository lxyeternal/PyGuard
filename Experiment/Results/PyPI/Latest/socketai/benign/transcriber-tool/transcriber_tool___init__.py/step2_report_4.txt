  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports indicate that the code snippet contains only a comment describing a CLI tool for transcribing audio files into text and a version string.\n   - No functions, data input/output, external interactions, or logic are present.\n   - This is consistent across all reports, confirming that the code is minimal and primarily informational.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - None of the reports identify any suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code.\n   - The code contains no secrets, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, and no active logic.\n   - Based on the snippet, there are no signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the content.\n   - Since the code is purely descriptive with no executable or external interactions, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions about hidden behaviors; they only analyze the visible snippet.\n   - There is no basis to increase the risk scores since the code is benign.\n\n5. **Consistency & Reasonableness**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n- The code snippet is benign, containing only a comment and a version string.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe reports are accurate, and the code fragment poses no security threat. No adjustments to the scores are necessary.",
