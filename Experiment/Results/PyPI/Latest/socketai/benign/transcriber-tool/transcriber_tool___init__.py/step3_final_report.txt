  "purpose": "Minimal header comment and version string indicating a CLI tool for transcribing audio files to text.",
  "sources": "None; only a comment and a version variable are present.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; no executable code or data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code contains only a descriptive comment and a version string.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is purely informational, containing only a comment describing the tool's purpose and a version string. There are no functions, data processing, input/output, or executable logic. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The minimal nature of the code indicates it is a benign header or metadata fragment. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the lack of any security concerns. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is straightforward and contains no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal header with no executable logic or security risks. The reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
