{
  "purpose": "This CLI tool converts speech audio or video files into text transcripts using the 'faster-whisper' library.",
  "sources": "Reads input file paths from command-line arguments and configuration options; loads the 'faster_whisper' library internally.",
  "sinks": "Writes transcript output to files specified or auto-generated paths; logs information and errors via standard output.",
  "flows": "Input file path -> Validation -> Model loading -> Transcription -> Output file writing",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials. No obfuscated code, hidden network activity, or system manipulation observed. The code relies on an external library ('faster_whisper') which is standard for speech transcription.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs file validation, model loading, and transcription operations. It handles exceptions gracefully and logs progress. There are no signs of data exfiltration, network communication, or malicious file manipulations. The 'faster_whisper' library is imported dynamically and only used for transcription. The output paths are constructed securely without executing untrusted code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate speech transcription CLI tool utilizing a standard open-source library. No malicious behaviors or security risks identified. The code appears safe and appropriate for intended use.",
