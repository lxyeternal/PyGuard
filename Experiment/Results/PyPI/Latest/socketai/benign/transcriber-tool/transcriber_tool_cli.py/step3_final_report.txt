  "purpose": "A CLI tool for transcribing audio/video files into text using the 'faster-whisper' library, with input validation, model loading, and output management.",
  "sources": "File path input, external 'faster_whisper' library import, user-specified output path or directory",
  "sinks": "Writing transcription results to a text file, logging progress and errors",
  "flows": "Input file path -> validate file -> load model -> transcribe file -> generate output path -> save transcription -> log completion",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity; dynamic import of 'faster_whisper' is standard and safe",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation, lazy loading of an external library, transcription, and file output. No malicious patterns, code injection, or data exfiltration are present. The external dependency 'faster_whisper' is a well-known open-source library, imported only when needed. Error handling and logging are appropriate. The overall structure is clear and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-specific CLI tool for speech transcription. No malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are detected. The scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a low risk score (~0.1-0.2), are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
