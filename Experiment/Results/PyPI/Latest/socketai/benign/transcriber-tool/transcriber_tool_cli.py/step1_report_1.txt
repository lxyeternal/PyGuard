  "purpose": "This code provides a CLI tool to transcribe audio/video files into text using the 'faster-whisper' model.",
  "sources": "Reads input file path from CLI argument, checks file existence and extension, loads model when needed.",
  "sinks": "Writes transcription results to an output text file; no untrusted data sinks that leak data or execute code.",
  "flows": "Input file path -> validation -> model loading -> transcribe -> save output file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs observed. Logging is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical file validation, delayed model loading, and transcription, with standard logging and error handling. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration. No suspicious network activity, no dynamic code execution, or unsafe operations detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI tool for audio transcription without malicious behavior or security risks. It uses external libraries appropriately and handles files securely. No indicators of malware or malicious intent are present.",
