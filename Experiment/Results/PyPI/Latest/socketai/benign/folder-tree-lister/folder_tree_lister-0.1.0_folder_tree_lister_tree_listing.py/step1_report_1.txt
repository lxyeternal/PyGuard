{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to list the contents of specified directories up to a certain depth, excluding certain files and directories.",
  "sources": "Reads directory listings using os.listdir() and os.path functions, and reads the current working directory with os.getcwd().",
  "sinks": "Outputs directory structure to standard output using print(). No data is written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input directories are read via os.listdir(), filtered, and then displayed. No untrusted data flows into critical functions beyond standard directory reading.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The filtering criteria are standard for excluding cache and environment files. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The script lists directory contents with options to limit depth, excluding common cache and environment-related files. It performs directory validation and prints structure accordingly. No external network access, data exfiltration, or malicious actions are evident. The functions are straightforward and serve an informational purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign directory listing utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data beyond reading directory contents and outputs the structure via print(), which poses minimal risk.",
