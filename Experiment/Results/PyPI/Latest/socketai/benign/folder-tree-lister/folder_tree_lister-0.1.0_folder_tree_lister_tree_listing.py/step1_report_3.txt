{
  "purpose": "The code lists the contents of specified directories with a maximum depth, excluding certain files and directories, primarily for directory browsing or inspection.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current directory via os.listdir() and os.path functions, and reads specified directories via os.path.exists() and os.path.join().",
  "sinks": "The code outputs directory contents using print(), which could potentially leak filesystem structure information if exposed to untrusted users.",
  "flows": "Input sources (directory paths) flow into directory listing functions, which process and print the directory and file names; no untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks like network or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward directory listing with filtering. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs directory listing with filtering to exclude certain system files and directories. It recursively lists directories up to a specified depth. Usage of os and print functions is standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets or sensitive operations. It simply outputs filesystem structure, which could be sensitive if misused, but not malicious by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign directory listing utility with filtering, intended for inspecting directory structures. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It does not perform any harmful actions or leak data beyond listing directory contents.",
