{
  "purpose": "The code lists directory contents up to a specified depth, with filtering options for certain files and directories.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the filesystem using os.listdir(), os.path.isdir(), os.path.exists(), and os.path.join().",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data for execution or data exfiltration. The code outputs data to standard output (print statements), which is not inherently risky.",
  "flows": "Data flows from filesystem reads (sources) through directory listing and filtering functions, ultimately printed to stdout; no untrusted input directly influences critical operations or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious logic. The filtering functions are benign. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The only potential concern is if the directory listing is used maliciously, but as-is, it is a standard utility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a directory listing utility that filters out certain files and directories before printing. It uses standard library functions without any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The logic is simple, and all operations are filesystem interactions and printing to stdout. There are no security risks related to code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The code does not handle untrusted input in a dangerous way, nor does it execute system commands based on external data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign directory listing utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions, exfiltrate data, or contain hidden malicious code.",
