  "purpose": "The code lists the contents of specified directories up to a certain depth, with filtering options for excluding specific files and directories.",
  "sources": "os.path.isdir(), os.listdir(), os.path.join(), os.path.exists()",
  "sinks": "print() statements for outputting directory and file information",
  "flows": "Input directory paths from the filesystem → directory listing and filtering → output via print()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution or network activity present. The filtering functions seem standard and do not perform any malicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs directory traversal and listing operations with filtering, using standard Python OS functions. It filters out typical non-essential files and directories. There are no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious side effects. The functions operate within the filesystem context without external or network dependencies. The logic is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard directory listing utility with filtering capabilities. It does not exhibit any malicious or sabotage behaviors. It appears safe with no indications of malware or security risks.",
