  "purpose": "The code lists the contents of specified directories with a visual tree structure, filtering out certain files and directories.",
  "sources": "Reads the current directory and specified subdirectories via os.listdir and os.path functions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to standard output using print statements; no data is sent over the network or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Source: directory reading functions -> sink: print output; no untrusted data is fed into unsafe operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The script performs directory listing with filtering, with no evidence of malicious intent. It does not process untrusted input beyond reading directory contents, nor does it perform any network or system modification operations. There are no obfuscated or unusual language features. All functions and flow are typical for a directory tree listing tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and intended solely for directory visualization. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
