  "purpose": "Directory listing utility that recursively lists files and directories with filtering to exclude cache and environment files.",
  "sources": "os.listdir(), os.path.isdir(), os.path.join(), input parameters (current_dir, base_path, directories_to_check)",
  "sinks": "print() statements for outputting directory structure",
  "flows": "Source functions (os.listdir, os.path.join) provide data to print statements; no external data flows or network activity",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic; standard directory traversal and filtering",
  "analysis": "The code performs a safe, standard directory listing with filtering to exclude common cache and environment files. It uses well-known Python functions and outputs to stdout. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The filtering is benign, aimed at avoiding clutter from cache files. The code does not process untrusted input in a dangerous way. The only minimal concern is potential information leakage if directory structure is sensitive, but this is a common and non-malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign directory listing utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minimal information exposure is acceptable and does not constitute a security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1 to reflect the slight potential for information leakage, which is standard for such utilities.",
