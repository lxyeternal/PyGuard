{
  "purpose": "The code performs a relative import of two functions from a local module named 'tree_listing'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leakage.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports functions without executing or passing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present in the code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement importing 'list_current_directory' and 'list_multiple_directories' from a local module. No data processing, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, with consistent scoring and no signs of obfuscation or malware. Given only this snippet, there are no security concerns. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary. The overall security posture based on this snippet is very low risk.",
