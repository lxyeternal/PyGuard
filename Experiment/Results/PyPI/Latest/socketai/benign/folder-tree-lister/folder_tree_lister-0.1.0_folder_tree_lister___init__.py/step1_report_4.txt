  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data flows involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing observed in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of two functions from a local module. There are no data inputs, external communications, or complex logic. Without additional context or implementation details of 'tree_listing', no malicious behavior can be inferred. The import statement itself is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign.",
