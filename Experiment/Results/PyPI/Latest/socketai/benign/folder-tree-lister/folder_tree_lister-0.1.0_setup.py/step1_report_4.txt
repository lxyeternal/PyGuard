{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata and setup configuration for distributing a Python package that lists directory tree structures.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description, hardcoded strings for package info",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects",
  "flows": "Read from filesystem to assign long_description; package setup data flows are static and predefined",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code, no dynamic execution or suspicious imports",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup using setuptools. It attempts to read a README file to set the long description, with a fallback string if the file is missing. The setup parameters are typical for a Python package. No external inputs are processed in a way that could lead to security vulnerabilities. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and follows conventional patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
