  "purpose": "To set up a Python package named 'folder_tree_lister' with metadata and package discovery instructions.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description, package discovery via find_packages()",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or external inputs; no data leaks or insecure operations detected",
  "flows": "Input reading from README.md -> package setup configuration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for packaging, reads a README.md file for long description, and defines package metadata. It handles missing README.md gracefully. No external network operations, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms are present. Usage of find_packages() is standard for package discovery. No suspicious or malicious code features observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
