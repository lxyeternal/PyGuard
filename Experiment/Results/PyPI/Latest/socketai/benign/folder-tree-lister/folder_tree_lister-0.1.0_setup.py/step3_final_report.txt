  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging, using setuptools to define package metadata and discover packages.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, uses find_packages() for package discovery.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Reading local file for description; no external data or untrusted input flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup code with proper exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script employing standard practices. It reads a local README file with exception handling, discovers packages with find_packages(), and defines package metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or untrusted data processing. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The only minor discrepancy is in one report assigning a security risk of 0.1, which is unwarranted given the code's simplicity and safety. Therefore, the security risk score should be 0 across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, aligning with the code's benign nature.",
