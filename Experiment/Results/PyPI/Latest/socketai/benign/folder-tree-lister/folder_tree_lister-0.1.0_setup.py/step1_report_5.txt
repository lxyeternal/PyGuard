{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'folder_tree_lister' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description; gathers package information and metadata for setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data output; no data leaks or insecure operations identified.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> uses the data in setup parameters; no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard setup script with exception handling for missing README.md.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python package setup file. It reads a local README file with exception handling, then calls setup() with package metadata and package discovery. No code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious operations are present. Usage of try-except for file reading is safe and standard. All operations relate solely to package configuration; there are no external data flows or suspicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
