  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project named 'folder_tree_lister'.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long description, uses find_packages() to discover packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no user input or data output actions present.",
  "flows": "Reads static file content for description; no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: reading a README file for description, handling missing file gracefully, and configuring package metadata. There are no indicators of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious network activity. Usage of standard setuptools functions and no dynamic code execution or external calls are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a normal, benign package configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
