{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'folder_tree_lister', including metadata and package discovery instructions.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.md' file to obtain long description; reads standard package information for setup.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing or external data flow occurs in the code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows detected; setup script primarily reads local files and defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors identified. The file operations are standard; no obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses 'setuptools' for package setup, reads a README file safely with exception handling, and defines package metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, no external network calls, and no untrusted data handling beyond local file reading. The code appears to be standard, well-structured setup logic without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup script for packaging and distribution. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It reads local files and defines package metadata in a straightforward manner.",
