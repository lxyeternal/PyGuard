  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize some variables and possibly perform a configuration or setup routine, but no clear functional purpose is evident from the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "Reads from environment variables and local variables, possibly user input or environment configurations.",
  "sinks": "Uses print statements and possibly external modules, but no direct data leaks or malicious sinks are evident in this fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables and local variables through the code, but no evident untrusted data processing or external transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is very limited in scope, mainly involving variable initialization. No network activity, file access, or cryptic behavior. Lack of context makes it difficult to identify malicious intent. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign and typical of initial setup routines, with no indicators of supply chain attack elements.",
