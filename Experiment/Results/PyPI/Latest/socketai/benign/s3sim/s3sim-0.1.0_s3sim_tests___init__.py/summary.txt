  "conclusion": "The assessments are consistent and justified. Report 2 presents the highest concern with scores reflecting obfuscation and eval usage, indicating potential malicious behavior. Other reports show low or no risk. Slight adjustment to Report 3's risk score to 0.3 could improve alignment, but current scores are acceptable."
