  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the s3sim package, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Package metadata fields, dependencies, and entry point declaration",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sources",
  "flows": "Setup metadata and dependencies are declared without runtime data flow; entry point 's3sim.cli:main' may execute code at runtime but not during setup",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; placeholder author info is typical, no obfuscated or suspicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. Dependencies are standard for AWS simulation and testing. Entry points are typical CLI commands. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or untrusted data handling are present. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0. The setup script itself poses no security threat; runtime behavior depends on the CLI implementation, which is outside this script. The overall assessment is that the code is safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.",
