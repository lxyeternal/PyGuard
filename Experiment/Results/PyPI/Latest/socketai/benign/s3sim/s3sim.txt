      "conclusion": "The code is a standard S3 utility module with security flaws related to hardcoded credentials and code redundancy but no malicious intent or activity. The assigned malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The moderate risk score reflects security best practices violations but not malicious sabotage or malware."

      "conclusion": "The assessments are consistent and justified. Report 2 presents the highest concern with scores reflecting obfuscation and eval usage, indicating potential malicious behavior. Other reports show low or no risk. Slight adjustment to Report 3's risk score to 0.3 could improve alignment, but current scores are acceptable."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minimal security risk score (~0.1) is appropriate due to the use of environment variables for credentials, which is standard in testing environments. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and correctness."
