  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without specific context or comments, the exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, and potentially external modules or data files if imported, but no explicit external data sources are evident in the snippet provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network communication functions, or data output methods if present, but none are clearly visible in this code segment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (parameters, environment variables) through internal processing functions, but without further code, specific source-to-sink flows cannot be fully determined.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are detected. The code does not perform unusual operations or contain hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be straightforward, with standard function definitions and logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or credential theft. No unusual or suspicious code patterns are observed, and the structure suggests typical utility functions. Without additional context or external dependencies, there is no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The code seems benign, with no evident security risks or anomalies.",
