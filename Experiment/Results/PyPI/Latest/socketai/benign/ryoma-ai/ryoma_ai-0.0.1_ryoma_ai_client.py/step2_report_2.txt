  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a high-level wrapper around AI components, involving prompt building, embedding, vector search, and agent management.\n- All reports consistently note the absence of suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The code relies heavily on external modules (`ryoma_ai.*`) and factory functions, which are assumed to be trusted.\n- Data flows are internal and typical for such systems; no network or system commands are directly executed.\n- The malware scores are all zero, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- The security risks are very low, generally around 0.1–0.2, consistent with a benign orchestrator.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code?**  \n  No evidence of backdoors, code injection, or malicious data exfiltration. The code is standard for AI workflow orchestration.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Vulnerabilities?**  \n  No hardcoded secrets or insecure practices are evident. Inputs are handled via parameters, with no unsafe eval or system calls.\n\n- **Scores Justification:**  \n  The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1–0.2) seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Question about data sinks:**  \n  The only potential concern is the `stream()` method, which outputs data. If the agent or the `stream()` method is untrusted, it could leak data, but this is typical in such systems and not inherently malicious.\n\n- **External dependencies:**  \n  The reliance on external modules and factory functions makes it impossible to fully verify their trustworthiness here, but nothing suspicious is indicated.\n\n- **Potential assumptions:**  \n  The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious intent; they treat the code as a standard orchestrator.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- All reports: 0 — justified, no malicious activity.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- All reports: 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which is appropriate given the code's purpose and structure.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate (post-review):\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — 0.2 (consistent with reports, possibly slightly conservative)\n\nThe code appears benign, well-structured, and typical for an AI orchestration system. No modifications needed based on the current analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The scores are justified, and the code does not present any security concerns.",
