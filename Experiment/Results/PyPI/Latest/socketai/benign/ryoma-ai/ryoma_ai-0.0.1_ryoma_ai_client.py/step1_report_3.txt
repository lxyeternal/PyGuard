{
  "purpose": "Provides a high-level interface for executing LLM agent workflows and semantic search using pluggable backends.",
  "sources": "Imports from ryoma_ai modules, class methods and variables, input parameters like user_question, context, and metadata.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code primarily processes data through function calls without executing untrusted code or external commands.",
  "flows": "User input (question) flows into prompt construction and semantic search; data flows into embedding and vector store functions; no untrusted data directly influences system commands or external operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or malicious backdoors detected. The structure appears standard for a modular AI system.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for orchestrating AI workflows, utilizing external libraries for embedding, vector search, and prompt management. It accepts user inputs and contextual data, processes them through well-structured methods, and interacts with external components for semantic search and prompt generation. No signs of malicious data handling, code injection, or suspicious behavior are observed. The modules imported are standard and functional, with no evidence of obfuscation or malware. The flow of data is consistent with legitimate AI application design.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, serving as a coordinator for AI workflows with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It relies on external, presumably trusted, libraries and performs typical data handling for AI tasks.",
