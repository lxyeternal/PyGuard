{
  "purpose": "The code provides a high-level interface for executing language model workflows and semantic search using pluggable backends for agents, embeddings, and vector storage.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods creating embedder and vector store; methods receiving user input such as 'run', 'build_prompt', 'build_prompt_with_semantic_context', 'embed_document', and 'semantic_search'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted input data from parameters like 'user_question', 'question', 'metadata', 'doc_id', and 'text' which can flow into embedding, search, and prompt building functions.",
  "flows": "User inputs (questions, metadata, documents) are processed through prompt building, embedding, and search functions, which then interact with external models or storage components.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code relies on imported modules for core functionalities without revealing malicious intent. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured wrapper around agent management, prompt construction, embedding, and vector search. All input parameters are used in straightforward functions to build prompts, embed documents, or perform searches. The functions delegate core tasks to external modules, which are not visible here. There are no signs of malicious data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors within this snippet. All data flows are typical for such a system, and no suspicious behavior or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate high-level interface for managing AI workflows involving prompts, embeddings, and searches. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this module based on the visible code.",
