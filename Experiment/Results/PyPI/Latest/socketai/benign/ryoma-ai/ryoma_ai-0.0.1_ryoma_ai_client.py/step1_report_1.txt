{
  "purpose": "Provides a high-level interface for executing LLM agent workflows and RAG-style semantic search using pluggable backends.",
  "sources": "Input parameters (question, context, metadata), external library functions (create_embedder, create_vector_store), class methods",
  "sinks": "None evident; no direct untrusted data sinks like network, file, or system commands",
  "flows": "Question and metadata flow into prompt building, embedding, and semantic search; data is processed internally without external untrusted data sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods for building agents, prompts, embeddings, and performing semantic search. It relies on external libraries and factory functions for creating components, which are standard in modular design. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. All data flows are within controlled methods, with no external network or system commands present. The code appears well-structured, with no anomalies or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign implementation of a semantic search and agent management system. It uses external dependencies and factory functions appropriately, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
