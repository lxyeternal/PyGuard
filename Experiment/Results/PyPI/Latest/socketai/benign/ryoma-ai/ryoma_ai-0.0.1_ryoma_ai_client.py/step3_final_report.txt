  "purpose": "High-level interface for managing LLM agent workflows, prompt construction, embedding, and semantic search using pluggable backends.",
  "sources": "Input parameters (user_question, context, metadata), external modules (create_embedder, create_vector_store), and method calls (build_prompt, stream, index_documents, search_documents).",
  "sinks": "The stream() method outputs data; external modules may process data internally. No external untrusted sinks detected.",
  "flows": "User input flows into build_prompt and build_prompt_with_semantic_context; then into agent.stream(). Document texts are embedded via index_documents; queries are searched via search_documents.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. External dependencies are assumed trusted.",
  "analysis": "The code is a modular orchestrator for AI workflows, relying on external factory functions and modules. Data flows are internal, from user input to prompt building, agent streaming, and document indexing/search. No network activity, system commands, or obfuscated code are present. The code structure is clear, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed. External modules are assumed safe; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code are evident. The data flow involves typical AI system interactions, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, well-structured, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. External dependencies are trusted, and data flows are standard for such systems. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is negligible.",
