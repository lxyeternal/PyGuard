{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for executing language model workflows, including semantic search and prompt management, using pluggable components.",
  "sources": "Input data includes 'user_question' in run(), 'context' in build_prompt(), 'question' in build_prompt_with_semantic_context(), and document texts in embed_document().",
  "sinks": "The data flows into prompt building, agent streaming, and document indexing/search functions; potential leakage or injection points are through these data flows.",
  "flows": "User input ('user_question') flows into prompt creation and agent execution; 'context' and 'metadata' flow into prompt building; documents are indexed via 'text' inputs and retrieved via search queries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code relies on external factory functions and classes without hidden or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages orchestrating components for language model workflows. It constructs prompts, manages agents, and handles vector-based semantic search. All inputs and outputs appear consistent with typical usage; no suspicious data handling or hidden behaviors are evident. There is no indication of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The functions rely on imported modules for core functionalities, and the code does not perform unsafe operations or eval-like behavior. Overall, the code appears standard and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical high-level orchestrator for LLM workflows with no detectable malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be well-structured, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns. The overall security risk is minimal.",
