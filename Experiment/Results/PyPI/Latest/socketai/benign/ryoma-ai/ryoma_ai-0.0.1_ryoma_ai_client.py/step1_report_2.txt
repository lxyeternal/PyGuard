{
  "purpose": "Provides a high-level interface for executing language model workflows and semantic search using pluggable backends for agents, embedding, and vector storage.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods, method parameters (user_question, question, context, metadata), and internal method calls (create_embedder, create_vector_store, build_prompt, stream).",
  "sinks": "Method stream likely outputs data; potential data leaks depend on agent implementation. No explicit sinks for untrusted data handling are evident.",
  "flows": "User input (user_question, question) flows through build_prompt and stream methods; semantic search retrieves documents that are concatenated into context for prompt building.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code detected. The code appears straightforward and uses standard design patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing agent workflows and semantic search, utilizing external factory functions and configurations. It reads user input (questions), processes data through semantic search and prompt building, and streams responses from agents. No suspicious data handling, insecure practices, or hidden behaviors are observed. The design relies on external modules (ryoma_ai) which are assumed to be standard libraries; no direct network or system manipulation code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation for managing language model agents and semantic search. There are no signs of malicious activity, suspicious data leakage, or security vulnerabilities within this module. It leverages external components without embedding any malicious or obfuscated logic.",
