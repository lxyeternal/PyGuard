  "purpose": "Factory function creating vector store instances based on configuration parameters for different backend types.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters such as 'type', 'collection_name', 'persist_path', 'pgvector_url', 'qdrant_url' from the 'config' object.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; parameters flow into object constructors. No data leaks or network activity observed in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Source (config parameters) → object instantiation (Chroma, PGVector, Qdrant) → wrapped in LangchainVectorStore → return.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard factory pattern that instantiates vector store objects based on external configuration. It does not perform any network activity, data leaks, or execute untrusted code. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The parameters used are external and configurable, which is typical. The malware score is correctly set to 0, indicating no malicious intent. Security risk is low (~0.2), reflecting potential risks if configuration parameters are misused, but the code itself is benign. Obfuscated score is 0, and confidence is high (0.9-1). The scores are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, configuration-driven factory function for creating vector store instances. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or security flaws. The main security consideration is ensuring configuration parameters are secured and validated outside this code. The current scores are appropriate and reflect the code's safe nature.",
