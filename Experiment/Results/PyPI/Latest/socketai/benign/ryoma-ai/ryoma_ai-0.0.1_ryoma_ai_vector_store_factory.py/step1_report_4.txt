  "purpose": "Create and configure a vector store backend based on provided configuration and embedding function.",
  "sources": "config object properties: config.type, config.collection_name, config.persist_path, config.pgvector_url, config.qdrant_url; embedding_function parameter.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is sent or stored untrusted; no network transmission or sensitive data handling detected.",
  "flows": "Input config and optional embedding_function are used to instantiate a specific vector store object, which is then wrapped into a LangchainVectorStore.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; all code follows standard patterns for object creation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines a function to create a vector store, and selects implementation based on the 'type' property from config. It initializes different vector store objects with parameters from config, including potentially sensitive connection strings or directories. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious data flows are present. The function simply instantiates objects based on input parameters and raises an error for unsupported types.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward and does not contain malicious behavior. It securely creates vector store objects based on configuration parameters without revealing or transmitting sensitive data maliciously. No malware or security risks are evident.",
