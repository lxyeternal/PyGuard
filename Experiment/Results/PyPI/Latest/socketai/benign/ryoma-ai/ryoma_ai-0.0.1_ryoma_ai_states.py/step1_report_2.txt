{
  "purpose": "Define a TypedDict class to manage message states with methods to filter human and AI messages.",
  "sources": "The class accesses 'messages' from its internal state, which is annotated with 'add_messages'.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that handle untrusted input or output data directly.",
  "flows": "The methods filter 'messages' based on their class types; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Usage of 'add_messages' as a type annotation could suggest dynamic behavior, but this alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a TypedDict with a 'messages' attribute, which is annotated to include messages added via 'add_messages'. It provides methods to filter messages by their type, specifically HumanMessage and AIMessage. No input/output operations, network activities, or code execution functions are present. The use of annotations and method definitions appears standard and does not indicate malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward message management utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on external classes and type annotations, which are standard in such contexts.",
