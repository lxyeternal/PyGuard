{
  "purpose": "The code defines a TypedDict class for message state management and provides methods to filter messages by type.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'messages' attribute of the MessageState class.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; the methods only perform filtering operations.",
  "flows": "The message list is filtered by type; no external untrusted data is fed into these methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. Usage of imported modules appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports types and message classes, defines a TypedDict with a 'messages' attribute, and includes two methods for retrieving messages of specific types. The 'messages' attribute is annotated with 'add_messages', which is imported from 'langgraph.graph.message', possibly a decorator or marker. The methods perform list comprehensions to filter messages based on their class type. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code injection. The code appears to be standard message management logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as a data structure and utility for message filtering. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
