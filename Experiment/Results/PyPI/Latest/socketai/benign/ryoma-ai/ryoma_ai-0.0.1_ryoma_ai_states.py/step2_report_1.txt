  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description—it's a TypedDict with methods to filter messages by type.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** No errors or suspicious patterns. The use of `add_messages` in annotation could be a marker or decorator, but it doesn't introduce malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0; securityRisk = 0; confidence = 0.9. These seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The report's assessment aligns with the code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; the code is straightforward.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** No anomalies or malicious patterns. The note about 'add_messages' being potentially dynamic is not a concern here.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0; securityRisk = 0.1. Slightly higher but still reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Consistent with previous reports.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** No signs of malicious activity. The use of `Annotated` in a TypedDict is unconventional but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0; securityRisk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same structure; no malicious code.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** The unconventional use of methods within a TypedDict is noted but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0; securityRisk = 0. No issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Consistent with others.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0; securityRisk = 0.1. Slightly elevated but justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation and Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; I agree with a malware score of **0** across the board.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward, with some unconventional annotations but no obfuscation; **0** is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** The risk scores are low (around 0.1) and justified, given the code's benign nature.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the provided assessments.** There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The code appears to be a standard message filtering utility, with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reviews and the code's straightforward functionality.",
