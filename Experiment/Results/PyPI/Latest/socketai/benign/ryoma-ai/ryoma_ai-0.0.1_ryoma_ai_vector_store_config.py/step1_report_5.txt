  "purpose": "Define a configuration model for vector store settings, including types and optional connection details.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'type', 'collection_name', 'persist_path', 'pgvector_url', and 'qdrant_url'.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of URLs or paths that may connect to external services or access local resources.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to configuration attributes; no direct data processing or external communication shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of optional parameters for URLs and paths is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic model with fields for configuration data related to vector stores. There is no dynamic code execution, no network calls, and no handling of untrusted data. The optional URL fields could be used to connect to external services but do not themselves pose malicious behavior. The code appears to be a straightforward data schema with no embedded logic or potential for harm.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, well-structured configuration schema with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It serves to define parameters for vector store configuration without any suspicious or malicious features.",
