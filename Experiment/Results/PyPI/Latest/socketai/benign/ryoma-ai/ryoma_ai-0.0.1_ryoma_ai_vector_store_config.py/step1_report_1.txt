{
  "purpose": "Define a configuration model for different vector store types used in a system, likely for indexing or storage purposes.",
  "sources": "User input for 'type', 'collection_name', and optional URLs or paths; these are class attribute defaults or optional fields.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data directly; no data output or external calls are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines a data model with default values and optional fields.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns; the code is straightforward and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Optional' and 'BaseModel', then defines a Pydantic model with fields for vector store configuration. All fields are either string types or optional strings with default values. There are no functions, data processing, external calls, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are present. The use of 'Optional' for URLs and paths indicates flexibility rather than malicious intent. Overall, this is a typical configuration class without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign data model for configuration purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. No signs of malware or malicious intent are evident.",
