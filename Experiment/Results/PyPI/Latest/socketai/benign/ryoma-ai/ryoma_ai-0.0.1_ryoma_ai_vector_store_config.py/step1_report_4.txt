{
  "purpose": "Define configuration schema for different vector store types using pydantic models.",
  "sources": "User input through class instantiation; data assigned to class attributes.",
  "sinks": "None directly; the class itself does not execute or process data beyond validation.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., from config files or user input) flows into the class instantiation, validating the data without any further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The class merely defines data structure with optional fields.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing and pydantic libraries, then defines a class VectorStoreConfig inheriting from BaseModel. The class has fields for type, collection_name, and optional URLs/paths. No dynamic code execution, no network calls, and no sensitive data handling are present. The code appears to be a straightforward schema definition for configuration purposes, with no embedded malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data validation schema for configuration settings related to vector store backends. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It does not process data beyond validation, and the code structure is straightforward.",
