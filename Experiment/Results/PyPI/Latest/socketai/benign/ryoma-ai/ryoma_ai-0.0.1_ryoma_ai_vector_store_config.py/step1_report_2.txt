  "purpose": "Define configuration schema for different vector store types using Pydantic models.",
  "sources": "User-defined data inputs for vector store configuration (type, collection_name, persist_path, pgvector_url, qdrant_url).",
  "sinks": "Potential use of URLs or paths that may be used to connect to external services or storage locations.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the model's fields; URLs or paths could be used to connect to external resources, but the code itself does not perform connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious logic or behaviors present. Comments indicate configurable options for external services.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic model with several fields, including optional URL fields for external vector databases and a path for persistent storage. No code executes any network or file operations; it solely defines data structures. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The model could be used in an application that interacts with external vector stores, but on its own, it does not perform such actions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward configuration class for vector store parameters with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is safe and primarily serves as a data schema.",
