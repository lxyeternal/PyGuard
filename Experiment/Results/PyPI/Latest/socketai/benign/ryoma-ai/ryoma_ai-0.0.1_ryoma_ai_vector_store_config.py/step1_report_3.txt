  "purpose": "Define configuration schema for different vector store types using Pydantic models.",
  "sources": "User inputs for 'type', 'collection_name', 'persist_path', 'pgvector_url', 'qdrant_url'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no direct data output or untrusted data handling beyond input validation.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the VectorStoreConfig model fields, with optional URLs potentially supplied externally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic BaseModel with fields for vector store configuration, including optional URLs for specific services. There are no hardcoded secrets, no data leaks, no code injection, and no external system interactions within this snippet. The model's purpose appears to be standard configuration validation. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a configuration schema for vector store settings. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical, well-structured data validation class with no signs of malware or security issues.",
