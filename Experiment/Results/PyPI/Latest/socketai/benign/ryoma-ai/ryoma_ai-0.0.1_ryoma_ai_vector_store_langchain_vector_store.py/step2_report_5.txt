  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a wrapper with an unimplemented `index()` method. No malicious code detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The incomplete method is a development gap, not a security flaw.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — reasonable given the benign nature and incompleteness.\n- **Justification for risk score:** The low risk score aligns with the absence of malicious behavior; the incomplete method does not increase security risk.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to Report 1, with an unimplemented `index()` method.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Not malicious, just incomplete.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — slightly higher but still reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; the incomplete method does not pose security threats.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent; benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern; unimplemented `index()`.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No security concern.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, straightforward wrapper.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** No anomalies or suspicious code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Fully benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious code detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** None detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero mainly due to incomplete implementation (`index()` method), which is not a security concern but indicates ongoing development.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The current scores are reasonable given the code's content.\n- The malware scores should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated scores should stay at 0.\n- The risk scores could be marginally lowered to 0.1 or 0.2, reflecting that the only concern is incomplete implementation, not security risk.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to incomplete method, not malicious)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a straightforward, benign wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor risk score reflects incomplete implementation rather than security issues.",
