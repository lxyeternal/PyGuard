  "purpose": "Retrieve the package version information for the current module, handling the case where the package is not found.",
  "sources": "importlib_metadata.version(__name__), exception handling for PackageNotFoundError",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or data leaks involved",
  "flows": "get_version() calls importlib_metadata.version(__name__), exception handling returns 'unknown' if package not found",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward use of standard library functions with proper exception handling",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata (or importlib_metadata for older Python versions), defines get_version() which attempts to retrieve the current package's version using importlib_metadata.version(__name__). It handles PackageNotFoundError by returning 'unknown'. The code assigns this to a variable 'version'. There are no untrusted inputs, network calls, or obfuscated patterns. The logic is simple, standard, and correct. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The exception handling is appropriate, and the code does not leak data or perform any unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for retrieving package version information, with proper exception handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assess its safety, and the scores are appropriate.",
