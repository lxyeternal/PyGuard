  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the current Python package or module.",
  "sources": "importlib_metadata.version(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only retrieves version info.",
  "flows": "The function attempts to get the package version and handles exceptions internally; no external data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward version retrieval with exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the importlib.metadata module to access package metadata. It defines a function get_version() that attempts to retrieve the version of the current package/module using importlib_metadata.version(__name__). If the package is not found, it catches the PackageNotFoundError and returns 'unknown'. The code then assigns this version string to the variable 'version'. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows that could be exploited, nor are there any suspicious or malicious constructs present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for obtaining package version information with proper exception handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
