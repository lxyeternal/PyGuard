  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, evaluating the reasoning, and ensuring the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code in question is a straightforward utility to retrieve the package version using `importlib.metadata.version(__name__)`, with exception handling for when the package isn't found.\n- All reports agree that the code performs simple, benign version retrieval without user input, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The code's logic is correct and standard for such a utility.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and observations:\n\n1. **Code correctness:**\n   - The code correctly uses `importlib.metadata.version(__name__)` to get the current package/module version.\n   - Exception handling for `PackageNotFoundError` is appropriate.\n   - No signs of code obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n   - No untrusted data sources or sinks are involved.\n\n2. **Potential issues:**\n   - No issues are present; the code is a benign utility.\n\n3. **Scores evaluation:**\n   - `malware`: All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n   - `obfuscated`: All reports assign 0, correct.\n   - `securityRisk`: All reports assign 0, consistent.\n   - `confidence`: 1, justified given the straightforward nature.\n   \n4. **Any overestimation or underestimation?**\n   - The scores seem appropriate; no need to adjust.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. This is accurate; there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** 0, no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n- **Confidence:** 1, high confidence in benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a simple, well-understood pattern for retrieving package version info. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The exception handling is correct and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scoring is appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
