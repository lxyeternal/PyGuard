  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the details with the original code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues:**  \n   The code is a straightforward utility function that retrieves the package version using `importlib_metadata.version(__name__)`, with exception handling for `PackageNotFoundError`. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain any suspicious logic. All reports confirm this benign nature.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in describing the code's behavior.  \n   - They correctly identify that the code is simple, standard, and free of anomalies or malicious patterns.  \n   - No report suggests any logical errors or security flaws.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.  \n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward analysis.  \n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**  \n   - The highest risk score here is 0, indicating no security concern.  \n   - No issues warrant a higher score because the code performs a safe, well-understood operation.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**  \n   - Since the code does not perform any malicious activity, the malware score of 0 is justified.  \n   - No hidden or obfuscated code is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to the observed behavior.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   - The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**  \n- The code is a benign utility function for retrieving package version info.  \n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.  \n- The reports are accurate and well-justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThis code is safe, standard, and free of vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
