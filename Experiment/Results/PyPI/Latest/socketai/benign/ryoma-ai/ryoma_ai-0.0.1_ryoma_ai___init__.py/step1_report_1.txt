  "purpose": "Retrieve and report the version of the current Python package/module.",
  "sources": "importlib_metadata.version(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only returns package version information.",
  "flows": "The code attempts to get the version info of the current package/module and handles exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward version retrieval with exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and importlib.metadata, then defines a function to fetch the package version based on the module's name. It handles the case where the package is not found by returning 'unknown'. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are used. The code performs simple data retrieval without any suspicious logic or malicious behavior. No obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden functions are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility function for fetching package version info. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
