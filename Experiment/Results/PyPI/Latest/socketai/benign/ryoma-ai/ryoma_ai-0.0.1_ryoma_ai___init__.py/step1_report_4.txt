{
  "purpose": "Retrieve and display the version of the current package/module using importlib_metadata",
  "sources": "The code reads the module name (__name__) to get its version info via importlib_metadata.version()",
  "sinks": "The version string could potentially be used elsewhere, but no immediate data leak or insecure sink is present",
  "flows": "The code flows from calling get_version() to setting the version variable, with no external data sources or sinks involved",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to retrieve the package version using importlib_metadata with the current module name. If the package is not found, it gracefully defaults to 'unknown'. The code is simple, does not execute untrusted input, or perform any network or file operations. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for version retrieval in Python modules and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
