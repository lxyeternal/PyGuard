{
  "purpose": "Define a class FeastVectorStore that interfaces with Feast FeatureStore for vector search capabilities.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as store, feature_view, vector_column, metadata_column, and method arguments like ids, vectors, metadatas, and query_vector.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data is being written out or transmitted.",
  "flows": "User inputs (vectors, query vectors, and optional metadata) are processed internally; no data leaks or external transmissions are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The index() method raises NotImplementedError, indicating no direct ingestion implementation; search() relies on a potentially custom method retrieve_documents() which is not defined here. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition with methods intended for vector storage and retrieval within the Feast ecosystem. It includes placeholders and error checks, but no actual data processing or transmission occurs within the class. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code are observed. The code appears to be a part of a larger framework, with reliance on external implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard interface wrapper for vector search in Feast, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured for its purpose, with no suspicious behaviors detected.",
