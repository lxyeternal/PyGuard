  "purpose": "Defines a custom vector store class for integrating Feast FeatureStore with vector search capabilities.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read directly in this code; it operates on passed parameters and attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; no untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code does not process untrusted input or produce output affecting external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The index() method raises NotImplementedError, indicating it does not support direct ingestion, which is consistent with the comment. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present. The search() method relies on an external method 'retrieve_documents', which is expected to be implemented by the user and is not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The class provides a structure for a vector store that interfaces with Feast's FeatureStore. It does not implement any data ingestion or retrieval logic itself. The index() method explicitly raises NotImplementedError, indicating that ingestion should be handled outside, possibly via batch jobs, which is a common pattern. The search() method checks for the presence of a 'retrieve_documents' method, but does not invoke any untrusted code or data within this snippet. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. The code appears to be a typical, intentionally incomplete interface setup for a vector search system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious interface for a vector store using Feast. It does not contain any malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. It relies on external implementations for core functionality, which is common in plugin or interface code. Overall, it appears safe and does not pose security risks based on this analysis.",
