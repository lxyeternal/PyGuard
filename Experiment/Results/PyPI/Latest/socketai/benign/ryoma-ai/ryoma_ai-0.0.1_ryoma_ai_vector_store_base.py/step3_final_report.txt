{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract interface for a vector store system, including methods for indexing vectors and documents, and for performing semantic searches.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; class and method signatures only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication; purely structural definitions.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; methods are unimplemented and serve as interface placeholders.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward use of Python abstract classes and dataclasses with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class and method signatures with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. It employs standard Python features like ABC and dataclasses. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are present. The code's purpose is to define interfaces for a vector store, which is common in semantic search systems. Given these observations, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard interface definition with no malicious or security concerns. All signals indicate a safe and straightforward structure, appropriate for its purpose.",
