{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract classes and data structures for a vector store used in semantic search.",
  "sources": "No input sources reading untrusted data; only class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no code that sends data externally.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; methods are placeholders with no implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. All methods are abstract.",
  "analysis": "The code provides abstract base classes for a vector store, including data classes for search results and method signatures for indexing and searching. There is no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. The code appears to be a standard framework setup for further implementation without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious framework for vector-based search operations. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and appears purely structural.",
