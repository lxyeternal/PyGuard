  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for a vector store with methods for indexing and searching vectors and documents.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input directly; it defines class methods with parameters.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or processes untrusted data directly; it's an interface definition.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink within this code, as it is only abstract method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structure for a vector store with methods for indexing vectors and documents, and for searching by vector or text query. It uses type annotations and docstrings but does not include any implementation details or runtime data handling. No external input or data processing occurs here, and there are no security-sensitive operations present. It functions solely as an interface definition, with no malicious or risky behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward abstract class definition for a vector database interface. It contains no code that could be malicious, harmful, or insecure. It serves as a blueprint for future implementations. No security risks or malware signals are present.",
