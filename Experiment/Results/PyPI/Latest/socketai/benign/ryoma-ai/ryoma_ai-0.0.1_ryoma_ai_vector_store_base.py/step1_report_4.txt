  "purpose": "Define abstract classes and data structures for a vector store used for embedding and semantic search.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; only class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no data processing or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only defines interfaces and data structures without executing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides abstract base classes and data structures for vector storage and search functionalities. It does not contain executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. No potential malicious behavior or security risks are evident in these definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of interface definitions and data classes for a vector store system. It appears benign, with no malicious intent or security risks present.",
