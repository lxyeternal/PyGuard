  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely an abstract interface with no executable logic, data handling, or external communication.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious code are detected.\n- The code is standard, using Python features like ABC, dataclasses, and type annotations.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, aligning with the fact that this is just interface code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- The code does not read external input, write to sinks, or perform any data processing.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The purpose is clearly to define an interface for vector storage and search, which is a common pattern in semantic search systems.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n\n- Since this is only an interface, the actual implementation could introduce risks, but as presented, there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n- The reports are consistent in their assessments and scores.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score (0):** Appropriate, as the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\nGiven the code and the reports, I agree with their evaluations. The code is a benign, standard interface definition with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications needed. The code appears safe, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
