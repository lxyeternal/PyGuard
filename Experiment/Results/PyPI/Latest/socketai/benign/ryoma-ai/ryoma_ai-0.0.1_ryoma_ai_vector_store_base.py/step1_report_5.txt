  "purpose": "Define abstract classes and data structures for a vector store used in semantic search, including methods for indexing and searching vectors and documents.",
  "sources": "No direct input reading sources; the code defines method signatures and data structures without executing data intake.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data output points; methods are not implemented and do not perform actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as the methods are unimplemented; no source-to-sink pathways are established.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is a straightforward abstract class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines dataclasses and abstract base classes with method signatures for indexing and searching vector data. It includes docstrings explaining intended use but contains no executable logic, input handling, or data transmission. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be a standard interface definition for a vector store system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-executable interface with no malicious or suspicious elements. It provides a clear structure for vector-based search operations without any embedded or hidden malicious logic. Overall security risk is negligible.",
