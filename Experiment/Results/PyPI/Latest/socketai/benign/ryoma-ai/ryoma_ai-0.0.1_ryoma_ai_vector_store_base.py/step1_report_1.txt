{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for a vector store used for embedding, indexing, and searching vector-based data.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data at runtime, only defines class structures and method signatures.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks or untrusted data handling operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is a set of abstract method signatures without actual data flow implementations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; standard use of Python typing, ABC, and dataclasses.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an abstract base class 'VectorStore' with methods for indexing and searching vectors and documents, utilizing standard Python features. No data processing, input handling, or code execution occurs here. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. It appears to be a clean interface definition for a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward abstract class definition for a vector store interface, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any data handling, external communication, or other potentially dangerous operations.",
