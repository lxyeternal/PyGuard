  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely an abstract interface with no runtime data handling, no external communication, and no implementation logic.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which is consistent given the nature of the code.\n- The purpose is consistently described as defining interfaces and data structures for vector storage and search.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Consistency:\n- **Code presence:** The code is only class and method signatures, with no executable logic or data processing.\n- **Malicious intent:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the code does not perform any operations that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n### Scores:\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, matching the analysis.\n\n### Potential Issues:\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable. No adjustments needed.\n- Since the code is purely an interface, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The high confidence (1.0) across reports is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own scores based on this analysis, they would be identical:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, standard interface definition with no security concerns.",
