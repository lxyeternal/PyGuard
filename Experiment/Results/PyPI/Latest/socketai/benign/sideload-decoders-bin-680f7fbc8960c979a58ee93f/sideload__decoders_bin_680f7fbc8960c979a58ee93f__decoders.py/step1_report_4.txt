{
  "purpose": "Provide classes and functions for decoding various content encodings such as identity, gzip, deflate, brotli, and zstd, including handling multi-encodings and chunked data.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (codecs, io, zlib, typing) and optional external libraries (brotli, zstandard); usage of external decoders; class initializers and methods that process data streams.",
  "sinks": "Decoding functions that process input bytes and produce decoded output; flush methods that finalize decoding streams.",
  "flows": "Input bytes → decoder.decode() → output bytes; for multi-decoder, chaining decode() calls; flush() propagates through decoders to finalize streams.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. Optional dependencies are handled gracefully; no malicious code patterns or obfuscated logic detected. The code does not perform network operations or data exfiltration. All external library imports are for standard decoding purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of decoders for various content encodings, with proper error handling via custom DecodingError. Optional support for brotli and zstandard is implemented with fallback mechanisms. No network activity, no data leaks, no code injection, or suspicious data handling observed. The logic is consistent with standard decoding operations. No anomalies indicating malicious intent or sabotage are present. The code appears to be standard library code for content decoding, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for handling content encodings with optional external libraries, containing no malicious behavior or sabotage signals. It is well-structured and safe for use. No security risks or malware are detected.",
