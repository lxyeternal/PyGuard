{
  "purpose": "Provides content decoding for various compression algorithms (gzip, deflate, brotli, zstd) with optional dependencies, handling errors appropriately.",
  "sources": "Input data to decode methods, optional dependencies import statements.",
  "sinks": "Decoded output bytes or strings; no external data exfiltration or malicious sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through decode methods of decoders, potentially via multi-decoder sequences, into output.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; safe optional dependency handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard content decoders with safe optional dependency imports, proper error handling, and no network or malicious activity. It handles multiple compression formats, supports incremental decoding, and manages errors correctly. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The optional dependencies are imported within try-except blocks, and their absence disables related functionality gracefully.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation of HTTP content decoders supporting multiple compression algorithms. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or supply chain attack elements. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero.",
