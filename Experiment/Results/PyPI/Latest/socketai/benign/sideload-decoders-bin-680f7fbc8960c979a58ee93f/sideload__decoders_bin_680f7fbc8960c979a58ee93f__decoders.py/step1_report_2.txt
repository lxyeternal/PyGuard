{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for handling content encoding and decoding in HTTP communications, supporting multiple compression algorithms such as gzip, deflate, brotli, and zstd.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input bytes in methods like decode() in various decoder classes, and input strings in line and text decoders.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs decoded data, flushes buffers, and returns chunks of data or text, with no direct sink that writes untrusted data to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from decode() methods (sources) through decoding processes in each class, potentially through multi-decoder chains, to final output buffers or returned chunks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no dynamic code execution or reflective features. Optional dependencies are imported safely with fallbacks. No suspicious network activity, file operations, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard content decoding mechanisms for HTTP content-encoding, with appropriate error handling and fallback for optional dependencies. It uses safe practices such as try-except blocks and dependency checks. No signs of malicious backdoors, privilege escalation, or data leakage routines are present. The optional support for third-party libraries is handled safely, and there are no unusual behaviors or code anomalies. The methods perform typical decoding operations, with no external system interaction beyond processing input data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of content decoding for HTTP applications, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is well-structured and uses standard libraries and patterns. No malware or malicious behavior is detected.",
