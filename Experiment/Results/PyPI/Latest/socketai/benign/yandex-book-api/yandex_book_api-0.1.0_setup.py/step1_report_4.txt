{
  "purpose": "The setup.py script is used to configure the packaging and distribution of a Python project named 'yandex-book-api'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'README.md' file to generate the long description; other data such as package requirements and metadata are hardcoded within the script.",
  "sinks": "The script does not process untrusted data or input at runtime; it mainly reads a local file and passes static data to setuptools.",
  "flows": "The file reads 'README.md' content and passes it to the setup function; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code uses standard setup procedures with no obfuscated or unusual constructs. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration file for a Python package. It reads a local 'README.md' file for the long description, which is standard practice. The rest of the data, including package metadata and dependencies, are static strings. There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs. All code follows conventional patterns for Python package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
