{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package named 'yandex-book-api' using setuptools, specifying package metadata, dependencies, and configurations.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; static metadata fields like author, email, license, and URL; dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data is processed or outputted in a vulnerable way.",
  "flows": "N/A — the script performs configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed; the code follows standard package setup conventions.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py is a standard package configuration script. It reads a README file for description and specifies package metadata and dependencies. No user input or untrusted data is processed. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or sensitive data handling occurs within this script. All code appears to be boilerplate for Python packaging with no malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows.",
