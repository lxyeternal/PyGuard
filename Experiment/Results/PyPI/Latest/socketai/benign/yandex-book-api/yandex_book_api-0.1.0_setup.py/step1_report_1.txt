{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script is used to configure the packaging and distribution of a Python project named 'yandex-book-api'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the long description from 'README.md' and gathers package information using find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; no network, file, or environment variable usage that could be malicious.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the README.md file into the long_description parameter during setup; no other data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code practices, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code uses standard setup tools without obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, utilizing setuptools. It reads the long description from a file and specifies package metadata and dependencies. No user input, environment variables, or external untrusted data sources are involved. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. All dependencies and metadata appear typical for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is benign, standard, and contains no malicious code or security risks. It is a typical package configuration file with no anomalies or malicious intent.",
