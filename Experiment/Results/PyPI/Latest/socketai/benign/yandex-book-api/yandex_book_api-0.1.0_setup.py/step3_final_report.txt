{
  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads long_description from 'README.md' file, uses find_packages() to locate packages.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed, no network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Static data from files and package metadata into setup() call; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and follows common packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. It reads a local README file, specifies dependencies, and package metadata. No suspicious data flows, network activity, or environment variable manipulations are present. The dependencies are standard and do not suggest malicious intent. The code does not process untrusted input or perform any runtime operations that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate it is safe and well-structured.",
