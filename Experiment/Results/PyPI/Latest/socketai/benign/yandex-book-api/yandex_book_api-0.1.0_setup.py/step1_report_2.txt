  "purpose": "This setup.py script configures the packaging and installation of a Python project named 'yandex-book-api'.",
  "sources": "Reads the long description from 'README.md', specifies package metadata, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "Reads external file for description → installs specified dependencies during package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code, no obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package configuration. It reads a markdown file for description, sets author info, and specifies dependencies. There are no dynamic code executions, no external inputs beyond static files, and no suspicious behaviors. The dependencies are typical and do not exhibit any malicious patterns. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate setup script with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py file is a standard package configuration script with no malicious code or security issues detected.",
