{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for loading, processing, extracting frames, and saving videos using OpenCV.",
  "sources": "Input sources include video file paths for loading videos and output paths for saving videos; data is read via cv2.VideoCapture and file system operations.",
  "sinks": "Output sinks are video files written to specified paths; no data leaks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Flow from reading input video files through cv2.VideoCapture to processing frames via process_function, then writing processed frames to output video files; no external or untrusted data transfer detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated segments identified. No unusual or hidden behaviors observed. The use of tqdm for progress bars is standard. No dynamic code execution or data exfiltration routines detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard video processing routines: loading videos, extracting frames, applying a user-provided processing function, and saving videos. All operations use OpenCV functions without any unsafe or suspicious calls. The get_codec_for_file method maps file extensions to codecs in a typical manner. Error handling is straightforward, raising exceptions on failure to open videos or when no frames are provided for saving. No network operations, data leaks, or credential handling are present. The resource management functions properly release resources. Overall, the code appears to be a safe utility module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for video processing with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard libraries and patterns, with no evidence of sabotage or malware. It is safe to use in production environments.",
