{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for loading, processing, and saving videos, including extracting frames, determining codecs, and applying frame-wise processing.",
  "sources": "User inputs for file paths (output_path, video_path), frames extracted from videos, and user-defined processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Saving processed video files to disk, potentially overwriting existing files; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input paths → load_video/load_video properties → extract_frames/process_video_frames → save_video → output files.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; no suspicious network activity, backdoors, or privacy violations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of utility functions leveraging OpenCV for video processing tasks. It includes functions to determine codecs based on file extensions, load videos, extract frames, save videos, and process frames with user-defined functions. Progress bars are used for user feedback. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network communications, or hidden backdoors. All resource management functions are standard. The code operates locally on files and frames, with no evident malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a standard, safe utility set for video processing tasks without malicious intent. There are no indicators of malware or malicious behavior; the code is clean and well-structured.",
