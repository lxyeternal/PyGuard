{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for loading, processing, and saving videos, including frame extraction and processing with user-defined functions.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from video files via cv2.VideoCapture, specifically in load_video() and process_video_frames().",
  "sinks": "Output data is written to video files via cv2.VideoWriter in save_video() and process_video_frames().",
  "flows": "Data flows from input video files through frame extraction or processing functions, potentially transforming frames, then outputs to video files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. The code uses standard OpenCV functions for video processing, and no network communication, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured, relying on standard libraries for video handling. It includes safe operations like resource management and progress indication. No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious logic is present. All functions perform expected video utility tasks without side effects or hidden behaviors. The use of cv2 and numpy is standard, and no external or hidden data flows are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a legitimate, safe set of utility functions for video processing. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be intended for legitimate video processing tasks without malicious intent.",
