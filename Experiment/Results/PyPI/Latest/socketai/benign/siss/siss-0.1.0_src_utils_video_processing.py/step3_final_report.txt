  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for video processing tasks such as loading videos, extracting frames, processing frames with custom functions, and saving videos.",
  "sources": "File system (video file paths), cv2.VideoCapture for reading videos, frame data during extraction and processing",
  "sinks": "Writing processed frames to output video files via cv2.VideoWriter",
  "flows": "Input video file -> load_video() -> extract_frames() or process_video_frames() -> processed frames -> save_video() -> output file",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious external calls detected",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries (cv2, numpy, tqdm) for video processing. It includes functions for determining codecs based on file extension, loading videos, extracting frames with progress indication, processing frames with user-defined functions, and saving videos. Proper resource management is observed, with release calls for video capture and writer objects. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code patterns are present. The logic is straightforward, with error handling for file access and empty frame lists. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are detected. The code's behavior aligns with legitimate video utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for local video processing, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and the overall security risk score very low (~0.1).",
