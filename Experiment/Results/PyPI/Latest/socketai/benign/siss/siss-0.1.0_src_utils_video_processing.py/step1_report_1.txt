  "purpose": "Utility functions for loading, processing, and saving videos using OpenCV.",
  "sources": "Reading video files via cv2.VideoCapture, extracting frames, file path inputs, and processing frames with user-defined functions.",
  "sinks": "Writing processed frames to output video files using cv2.VideoWriter; potential data leakage if output paths or frame data are mishandled.",
  "flows": "Input video paths -> load_video -> get_video_properties -> extract_frames / process_video_frames -> save_video -> output files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious domain calls, or obfuscated code; usage of standard OpenCV functions for video processing. No unusual dynamic code execution, backdoors, or malware-like behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward video processing utilities: loading videos, extracting frames, processing frames via user-supplied functions, and saving output videos. It uses open-source libraries (cv2, numpy, tqdm) in conventional ways. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity is present. The functions handle resources carefully, with proper release. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious file manipulations, or obfuscated logic. All operations are consistent with normal video processing workflows.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, legitimate set of utility functions for video processing without malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior. The overall security risk is very low.",
