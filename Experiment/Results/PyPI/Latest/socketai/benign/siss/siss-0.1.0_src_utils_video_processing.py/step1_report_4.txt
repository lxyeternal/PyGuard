  "purpose": "Utility functions for loading, processing, and saving videos, including frame extraction and processing.",
  "sources": "os.path.splitext to get file extension, cv2.VideoCapture for loading videos, cv2.VideoWriter for saving videos, tqdm for progress bars.",
  "sinks": "cv2.VideoWriter.write for saving frames, potentially writing processed video output.",
  "flows": "Input video file → load_video() → process_video_frames() applying process_function → save_video() or VideoWriter → output video file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secret data. Usage of standard libraries with no obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution or suspicious external connections detected. Functions are straightforward, no hidden backdoors or data leaks apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code provides typical video processing utilities using OpenCV and tqdm for progress indication. No suspicious code paths, secret data, or malicious network activity are present. The functions handle file input/output and frame processing securely and transparently. There are no indications of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The code appears standard and intended for legitimate video processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of utility functions for video processing with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. It is safe for use.",
