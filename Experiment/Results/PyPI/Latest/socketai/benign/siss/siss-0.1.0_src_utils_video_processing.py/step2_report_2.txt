  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is standard, uses OpenCV, no malicious activity, and the overall security risk is very low.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is straightforward, with no signs of malware or suspicious behavior. The reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard usage, no suspicious code, and the security risk is minimal.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis. The security risk is slightly above zero, perhaps due to the potential for misuse if the code is used maliciously, but the code itself is benign. The reasoning is consistent, and the scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard video utility functions, no suspicious behaviors, no malware.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The security risk score is minimal, reflecting the low likelihood of malicious use.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard, straightforward, no suspicious code, no network activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent with the scores. The code appears safe and benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, no suspicious activity, straightforward utility functions.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No. All reports correctly identify that the code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None apparent. All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores justification:**\n  - Malware: 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n  - Security risk: Very low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal concern, which is reasonable given the benign code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
