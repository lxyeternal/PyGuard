{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for the 'apply_duotone' function in the 'duotone' module, verifying its behavior with valid and invalid inputs.",
  "sources": "The code reads input video files ('test_input.mp4') from temporary directories and user-provided paths; also reads and processes video frames using OpenCV and numpy.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output video files ('test_output.mp4') to temporary directories; no untrusted data directly affects system configuration or sensitive data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input video files are read; 'apply_duotone' processes and writes output videos; tests verify existence and content of output files.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code strictly performs testing and file handling.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up temporary test video files, generates simple gradient frames, and applies the 'apply_duotone' function. It verifies output existence, dimensions, and error handling for invalid inputs. No dynamic code execution, external network connections, or suspicious data manipulation are present. The code uses standard libraries (unittest, os, tempfile, numpy, cv2) for testing purposes without any malicious intent. All operations are typical for unit testing image processing functions. No hidden backdoors or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard test suite for a video processing function, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It performs typical input/output operations and error checks in a controlled testing environment.",
