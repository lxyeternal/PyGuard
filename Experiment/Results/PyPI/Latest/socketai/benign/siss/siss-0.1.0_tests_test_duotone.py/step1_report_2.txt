{
  "purpose": "Unit testing the duotone image processing module to verify its functionality and error handling.",
  "sources": "Reads from temporary test video files created in setUp; input video file path; color parameter inputs.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input video files are read for processing; colors are input parameters; the apply_duotone function processes data; output video file is written.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; standard test setup and execution; no hidden code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines unit tests for the apply_duotone function, creating test video data, and validating function behavior. No system commands, network activity, or data leaks are present. Error handling checks for invalid input files and color values. Use of standard libraries (unittest, os, tempfile, numpy, cv2) poses no security concern. The code does not include any code injection, backdoors, or malicious actions. All data flows are contained within the test framework. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for a video processing function with no malicious or suspicious elements. It performs controlled tests without malicious intent, containing no malware or security risks.",
