  "purpose": "Unit tests for the duotone module, verifying the application of duotone effects on video files and error handling.",
  "sources": "Reading input video files, creating test frames, and validating output files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code processes local files and performs in-memory operations.",
  "flows": "Input files are read during tests; output files are written after applying effects; validation occurs through file existence and frame content checks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite that creates test videos, applies the 'apply_duotone' function, and verifies output integrity and error handling. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. All reports concur that the code is benign, with high confidence levels. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit testing script with no malicious intent or security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0, consistent with the reports and analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
