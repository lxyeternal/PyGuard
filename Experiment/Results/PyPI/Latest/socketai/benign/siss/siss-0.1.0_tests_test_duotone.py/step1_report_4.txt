  "flows": "Input files read during apply_duotone execution, output written via cv2.VideoWriter",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit testing for the duotone image processing function, creating a test video file, running tests for application of duotone effects, and verifying outputs. It uses standard libraries (unittest, os, tempfile, numpy, cv2) without any suspicious code or obfuscated patterns. No data leaks, credential handling, or network activity are present. The tests verify input validation and output correctness. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign unit test suite for an image processing function. It does not contain malicious code or suspicious activities. All functions used are standard testing and image processing tools, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
