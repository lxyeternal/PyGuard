  "purpose": "Unit tests for the halftone module, verifying functionality and error handling.",
  "sources": "Reading test video files, creating gradient frames, and input parameters for apply_halftone.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Test setup creates input files; tests invoke apply_halftone, then verify output existence and properties.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded values are for test purposes, no suspicious code activities observed.",
  "analysis": "The code creates temporary files and directories for testing, generates a simple gradient video, and runs multiple test cases to validate the halftone effect. All operations involve controlled inputs with no external data processing or malicious data handling. The test functions invoke apply_halftone with various parameters, and verify the output files' existence and basic properties. Error handling tests check for expected exceptions on invalid inputs. No suspicious or malicious activities, network communications, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for a visual processing function with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It operates solely within a controlled testing environment, with no evidence of malware, data exfiltration, or harmful actions.",
