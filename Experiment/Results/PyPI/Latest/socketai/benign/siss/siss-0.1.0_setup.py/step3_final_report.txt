{
  "purpose": "A setup script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, dependency list, and entry point declaration; no untrusted input or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "None; the script does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "N/A; as the code is static configuration without data flows or runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and lacks obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration using setuptools, with no dynamic execution, user input, or malicious patterns. All dependencies are common, and the entry point references a main function in src. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and poses no security risks or malicious intent. All analyses and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
