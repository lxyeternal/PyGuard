  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package called 'siss', a command-line utility for applying artistic effects to videos.",
  "sources": "User or external input could potentially come from environment variables during package installation, but none are explicitly used; data is primarily from package dependencies and metadata.",
  "sinks": "Installation dependencies, package metadata, and entry point configuration; no untrusted data handling or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily defines package setup parameters and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. All elements are typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No user input is processed or executed, and no dynamic code execution is present. The dependencies are common and reputable, with no signs of malicious or suspicious content. The entry point points to a main function in src.main, which is outside the scope of this code, but its configuration appears standard. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations are found.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
