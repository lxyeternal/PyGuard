  "purpose": "The code provides utility classes for data handling (`Dam`, `Dictor`) and a UI display class (`ScreenOpp`) using the Flet library.",
  "sources": "Method parameters (`args`, `extra`, `value`, `name`, `datas_`, `page`) and internal class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Console print statements and UI text display via Flet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs to internal attributes and then to print or UI output; no external data sources or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Minor redundant code in `Dam.conv` method (print after return), but this is benign and does not affect security.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no external data leaks, network activity, or malicious patterns. The print statements are used for debugging or informational purposes. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are present. The code's purpose appears to be utility and display, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, utility-focused, and free from malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minimal print statements do not pose security concerns. The overall security risk is very low.",
