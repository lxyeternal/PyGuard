{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define utility classes for data handling, conversion, and display within a Python application, potentially involving UI components via the Flet library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from method parameters such as args, extra, value, key, and datas_. It also involves user interface data via the display method.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to the console using print statements and updates the UI via ft.Text components in the display method. No data is sent over the network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs (args, extra, value, key, datas_) through comparisons and conversions, with outputs to print or UI elements. No untrusted data directly influences system commands or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious function calls, or obfuscated code are present. The code structure and logic are straightforward with no unusual or misleading patterns.",
  "analysis": "The classes implement basic data storage, comparison, and display functionality without performing any network operations or executing untrusted code. The print statements and UI updates are benign and do not pose security risks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system compromise. The code is well-structured, with clear and safe logic. No external dependencies are misused or used maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as utility and display code with no dangerous operations.",
