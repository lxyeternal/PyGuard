  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a simple import statement with no hidden or unusual syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement that pulls three classes from a relative module 'dam'. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. Since the code is minimal and standard, it does not exhibit malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. It lacks any input handling, data transmission, or execution of untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard import. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
