  "purpose": "Import specific classes (Dam, Dictor, ScreenOpp) from a local module named 'dam'.",
  "sources": "Import statement reads data from the local module 'dam'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this line; it is a straightforward import.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable, as this line only imports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the import appears standard for Python packages. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three classes from a local module, indicating modular design. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The import statement itself is standard and does not suggest any malicious intent or obfuscation. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are involved here. The code is minimal, with no indication of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This line of code is a normal import statement for local classes, with no signs of malware or security issues. It appears benign and serves a typical purpose within a larger codebase.",
