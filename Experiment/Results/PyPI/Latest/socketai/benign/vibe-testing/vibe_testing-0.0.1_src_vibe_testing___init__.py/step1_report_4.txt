  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a basic utility or script, but without specific context or comments, its intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules. No explicit user input sources are visible in the provided fragment.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file operations, or system commands if present. No explicit sinks are identified without detailed code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs/env vars) through processing functions towards sinks (outputs/commands). No explicit flow is identifiable from the fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation techniques are observed. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and does not include complex logic, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. Without additional context or more code, no anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but the limited snippet constrains full assessment.",
