  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, network or file operations, placeholders, minimal code snippets.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via environment variables, network connections, or file operations; no active sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data do not lead to any suspicious sinks; no malicious flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code or presence of placeholder/minimal code; no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the lack of concrete code, with appropriate caution. Scores for obfuscation and malware are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of suspicious activity. Risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting limited evidence but acknowledging incomplete context. Confidence levels are justified based on the amount of information. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are observed across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed show no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are appropriate given the limited data. The reports are consistent and cautious, with no immediate security threats identified.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
