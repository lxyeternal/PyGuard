  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated; it appears to perform some data processing or setup, but without further context, the precise intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables and possibly from external modules or files imported at the beginning.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, or data transmission points, but these are not explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or imported modules to processing functions or outputs, but without explicit code, the exact path cannot be determined.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are evident in the visible code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be either incomplete or a standard module with no suspicious patterns. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The structure is straightforward, and no suspicious network or file operations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code seems benign but limited context prevents a thorough security assessment.",
