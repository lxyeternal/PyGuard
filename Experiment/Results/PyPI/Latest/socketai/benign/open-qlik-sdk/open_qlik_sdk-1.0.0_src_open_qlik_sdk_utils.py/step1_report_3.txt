  "purpose": "Determine the MIME type of a file buffer based on its signature bytes.",
  "sources": "Reads from the 'buffer' parameter, specifically using buffer.peek() to access initial bytes.",
  "sinks": "Returns a string indicating MIME type; no data leaks or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input buffer.peek() -> signature extraction -> conditional checks -> return MIME type.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The use of buffer.peek() for signature detection is standard for MIME type identification.",
  "analysis": "The function correctly inspects the initial bytes of the buffer to identify PNG and JPEG signatures. It does not modify the buffer or perform any insecure operations. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and appears solely for MIME type detection based on file signatures.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard MIME type detection from file signatures with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
