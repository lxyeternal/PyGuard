  "purpose": "Determine MIME type of a given buffered input by inspecting file signature bytes.",
  "sources": "buffer.peek() method which reads initial bytes from the input buffer without consuming it.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing MIME type; no direct sinks for untrusted data but the method exposes file signature inspection.",
  "flows": "Input buffer.peek() → signature extraction → MIME type decision",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code present. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The function inspects the first few bytes of a buffer to identify common image file signatures for PNG and JPEG formats. It uses the buffer.peek() method, which reads data without advancing the buffer pointer. The logic is straightforward, matching specific hex signatures to file types. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is simple, well-structured, and only performs file signature analysis. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign file type detection based on file signatures. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The implementation is standard for MIME type detection based on file signatures, with no evident security risks.",
