  "purpose": "Detects MIME type of an image buffer based on file signature (PNG or JPEG).",
  "sources": "Reads initial bytes of the buffer using buffer.peek() to extract file signature.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only reads data for signature matching.",
  "flows": "Reads data from buffer.peek(), compares signature to known values, returns MIME type.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward signature detection with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code inspects the first bytes of the buffer to identify PNG or JPEG signatures. It uses buffer.peek() to avoid consuming data. The signature is converted to hex and compared to known signatures. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code is simple, standard, and performs a benign task. All reports agree on its safety, with scores reflecting no malware, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk. The logic is sound, and the code does not handle sensitive data or perform risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for MIME type detection based on file signatures. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
