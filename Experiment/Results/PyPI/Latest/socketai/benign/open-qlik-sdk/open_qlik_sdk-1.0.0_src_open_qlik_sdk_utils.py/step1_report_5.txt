  "purpose": "Determine the MIME type of a given buffer based on its file signature",
  "sources": "Reads the first bytes of a buffer using buffer.peek() to identify file signatures",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data causes effects or leaks; only reads data to determine MIME type",
  "flows": "Buffer.peek() → Signature comparison → Return MIME type",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears straightforward and typical for MIME type detection",
  "analysis": "The code reads the first few bytes of a buffer to identify if the file is PNG or JPEG based on known file signatures. It uses buffer.peek() to avoid consuming data, which is a standard approach. No suspicious logic, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code is present. The comparisons are based on well-known file signatures. No external data or network access occurs. The code is simple and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for MIME type detection based on file signatures. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely to identify image types from byte signatures.",
