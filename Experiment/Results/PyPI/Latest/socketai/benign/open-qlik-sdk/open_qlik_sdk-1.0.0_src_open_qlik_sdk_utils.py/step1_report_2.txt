  "purpose": "Determine the MIME type of a binary buffer based on file signature (magic numbers).",
  "sources": "buffer.peek() to read initial bytes of the buffer.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted outputs or external systems are present.",
  "flows": "buffer.peek() reads data, which is then used to identify file type based on signature.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded signatures are standard for file type detection. No malicious or suspicious code patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The function inspects the first bytes of the provided buffer to identify if it matches known signatures for PNG or JPEG files. It uses peek() to avoid consuming buffer data. The code performs straightforward signature matching without any obfuscation, hidden code, or external communications. No secrets, credentials, or injection points are present. The logic is simple and aligned with typical file signature detection techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for file type detection based on magic numbers. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. It functions as intended without any anomalies.",
