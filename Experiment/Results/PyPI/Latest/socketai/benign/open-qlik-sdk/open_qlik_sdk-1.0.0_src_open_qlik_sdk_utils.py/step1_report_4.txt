  "purpose": "Determine the MIME type of a buffered input stream based on file signature bytes.",
  "sources": "buffer.peek() method reading the first few bytes of the input stream.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing MIME type string, no external sink or data leakage identified.",
  "flows": "Buffer peeked at start -> signature bytes extracted -> MIME type returned based on signature.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code performs standard file signature checking.",
  "analysis": "The function checks if the buffer is provided, peeks at the first bytes, and extracts a signature. It then compares this signature to known PNG and JPEG signatures. The code performs basic file type identification based on common signatures. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious network activity. The use of buffer.peek() is standard for this purpose. No anomalies like obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a straightforward file signature check to identify MIME types and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a standard implementation for file type detection based on magic numbers.",
