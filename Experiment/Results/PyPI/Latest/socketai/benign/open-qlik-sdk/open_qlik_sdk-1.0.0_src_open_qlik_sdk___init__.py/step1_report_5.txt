{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a package's initialization or main module that imports various submodules, APIs, and SDK components to expose functionality for a larger application or SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules such as ._version, .apis.*, .auth, .config, .generate_signed_token, .qlik, and .rpc.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data are evident; the code primarily performs imports and exposes components.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules and exposing their contents; there are no dynamic data flows, network connections, or data processing from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code, are detected. The use of wildcard imports ('*') may be considered a code quality concern but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of import statements, including versioning, API components, and SDK modules. No data processing, network operations, or execution of dynamic code is present. The use of 'import *' can obscure what is being imported but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. The file appears to serve as an entry point or package initializer, exposing a broad set of functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initializer designed to expose modules and components for use elsewhere. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The only notable concern is the use of wildcard imports, which can reduce code clarity but is not malicious.",
