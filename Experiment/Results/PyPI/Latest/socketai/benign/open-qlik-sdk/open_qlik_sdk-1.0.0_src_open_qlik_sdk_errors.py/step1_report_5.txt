  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions and related messages for handling errors in an application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; exception classes are defined without data input mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmission points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; exception handling is local and internal.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. Exception classes do not perform external calls or operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes and message enums for use in error handling. The classes inherit from Python's built-in Exception and do not include any data leakage, network calls, or malicious logic. The __init__ methods initialize attributes based on input arguments but do not process or transmit external data. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The code appears to be straightforward and standard for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions and message enumerations for application error handling. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected.",
