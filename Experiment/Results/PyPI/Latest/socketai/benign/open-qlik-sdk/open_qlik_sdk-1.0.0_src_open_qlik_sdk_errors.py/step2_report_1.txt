  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Logic:**\n   - The code defines custom exception classes (`AuthorizeException`, `EngineClosedException`) and a message enum (`CustomExceptionMsg`).\n   - The exception classes dynamically assign attributes based on the arguments passed during instantiation, assuming these arguments are iterable collections like dictionaries.\n   - The pattern involves iterating over `args` and then over `self.__dict__.keys()`, setting attributes if the key exists in `a`.\n\n2. **Potential Security Concerns:**\n   - The main concern is the dynamic attribute assignment from `args`. If `args` contains untrusted data (e.g., malicious dictionaries), this could potentially lead to attribute injection or unexpected behavior.\n   - However, the code does not process external input directly; it relies on how the exceptions are instantiated elsewhere.\n   - No external data sources, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n\n3. **Malware & Obfuscation:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward and standard.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n   - The pattern of attribute assignment, while somewhat flexible, is common in exception handling and not inherently malicious.\n\n4. **Security Risk & Score Justification:**\n   - The reports assign a low security risk (~0.2) and malware score (0), which seems appropriate.\n   - The pattern could be exploited if untrusted data is passed, but within this code snippet, there's no direct evidence of such exploitation.\n   - The risk scores should reflect that the code itself is safe but note that misuse elsewhere could introduce risks.\n\n5. **Score Recommendations:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n   - **Risk Score:** Given the potential for attribute injection if misused, but no actual malicious behavior, a conservative score of around 0.2-0.3 is reasonable. The current scores of 0.2 seem appropriate.\n\n6. **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard pattern for custom exceptions with dynamic attribute assignment.\n   - No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no external data handling.\n   - The primary concern is the potential misuse if instantiated with malicious data, but this is a common pattern and not inherently dangerous.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.2) are reasonable.\n- I would maintain these scores but note that the pattern of dynamic attribute assignment should be used cautiously in broader application contexts.\n\n**Overall, this code appears safe and typical for exception handling, with no intrinsic security risks or malware.**",
