{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and associated message enums for use in a larger Python application.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; the code only defines classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "No potential sinks or untrusted data handling; no data output or network interaction present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from source to sink as no external data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected; the code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions, with additional attributes. It uses enums for message constants. There are no external inputs, network calls, file operations, or data processing that could be exploited. The code seems intended for error handling and does not include any malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes and message enums, with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It appears safe and appropriate for managing errors in a larger application.",
