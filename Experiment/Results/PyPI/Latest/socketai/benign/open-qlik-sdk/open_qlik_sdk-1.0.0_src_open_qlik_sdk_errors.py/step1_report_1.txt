  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and message enums for error handling in an application.",
  "sources": "Input data can originate from exception arguments passed during instantiation, notably in AuthorizeException and EngineClosedException classes.",
  "rews": "Untrusted data can be assigned to class attributes (error, error_code, etc.) during exception instantiation.",
  "flows": "Input arguments to exception constructors are iterated; if a dictionary with matching keys is found among args, its values are assigned to class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a nested loop to set attributes from args, assuming args are iterable dictionaries; no validation or filtering of args is present. No explicit handling for malicious payloads, but the pattern could allow injection if args are maliciously crafted, although typical usage is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple exception classes and message enums. The AuthorizeException and EngineClosedException classes dynamically assign attributes from their args, which are expected to be iterable collections like dictionaries. No external input is processed directly within this code snippet; any malicious behavior would depend on how these classes are instantiated elsewhere. There are no evident malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The pattern of assigning arbitrary attributes from args could potentially be exploited if untrusted data is passed, but in typical use, this pattern is safe. Overall, this code appears to be standard exception handling code with no malicious intent or security risks evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard exception classes with dynamic attribute assignment from constructor args. There is no malicious behavior or security risk intrinsic to this code snippet. Its security impact depends on how it is used elsewhere, but within this scope, it appears safe.",
