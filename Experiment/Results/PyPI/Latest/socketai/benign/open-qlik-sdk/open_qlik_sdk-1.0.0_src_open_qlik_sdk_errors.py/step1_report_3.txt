{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and enumerations for handling specific error messages and exception details.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data to external systems or perform risky operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks, as there are no input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "The __init__ methods attempt to iterate over args and access keys within each argument, assuming args are dict-like, which could raise exceptions if not. However, this is not inherently malicious but might lead to runtime errors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes with custom attributes and message enums. The __init__ methods use a pattern that presumes args are dicts containing keys matching class attributes, but there is no input sanitization or validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No external data sources, network operations, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, non-malicious implementation of custom exceptions with structured messaging. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
