  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**  \n   All reports conclude that the code is standard exception handling with no external input processing, network activity, or data exfiltration. The pattern of dynamically assigning attributes from args is common but could be risky if untrusted data is passed. However, within this code snippet, there's no evidence of malicious intent or behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \n   - The constructors assume args are iterable collections like dictionaries, and they iterate over args, then over the keys of each argument. If args are not dictionaries, this could raise runtime errors, but this is a typical pattern in flexible exception classes.  \n   - No validation or sanitization is performed on args, which could lead to runtime errors if misused, but not necessarily security issues.  \n   - No evidence of code obfuscation or malicious logic.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - Security risk scores are low (0.2 or 0), which is appropriate given the code's nature.  \n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n\n4. **Potential for Exploitation:**  \n   - The pattern of setting attributes from args could be exploited if malicious code passes crafted args, but this is a common pattern and the risk depends on how the classes are instantiated elsewhere.  \n   - Since no external input handling is present here, the risk remains minimal within this snippet.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**  \n   - The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions with message enums.  \n   - No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.  \n   - The risk scores are appropriately low.  \n   - The reports' confidence levels are high, and their conclusions are consistent with the code.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to the dynamic attribute assignment pattern which could be misused if misused elsewhere)\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the pattern of dynamic attribute assignment can be risky if misused with untrusted data, within this isolated context, the code appears safe and standard. The overall security posture is minimal risk, and no changes are necessary based on this review.",
