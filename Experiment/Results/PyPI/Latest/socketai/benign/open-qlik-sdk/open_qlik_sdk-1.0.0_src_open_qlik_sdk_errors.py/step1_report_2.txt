  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and message enums for error handling in an application",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data read operations present in the code",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external data output present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes and methods are for exception handling only",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute setting in exception constructors could be suspicious if combined with external data, but here it only processes arguments; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes and an enum for error messages. The constructors attempt to set attributes based on the arguments, assuming they are dictionaries. There is no evidence of external data input, network communication, or data leakage. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior is evident. The use of self.__dict__ and iteration over args is standard for dynamic attribute assignment, not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard exception handling classes without malicious intent or security risks. There are no indicators of supply chain attack, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.",
