{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes with dynamic attribute assignment for error details and messages.",
  "sources": "Constructor arguments passed during exception instantiation, assumed to be dict-like objects.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing present; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Arguments provided to exception constructors are iterated over, and their keys are assigned as attributes if present.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic attribute assignment from args without validation; assumes args are iterable collections like dicts.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes that assign attributes based on constructor args, which could be exploited if malicious data is passed. No external data sources, network activity, or data exfiltration are present. The pattern is common but could lead to attribute injection if misused. No obfuscation or malicious code is detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate, reflecting low risk but noting potential misuse if untrusted data is passed. Overall, the code is standard exception handling with minimal security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard for exception handling, with low security risk. The pattern of dynamic attribute assignment warrants cautious use but does not constitute malicious behavior. The current scores are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
