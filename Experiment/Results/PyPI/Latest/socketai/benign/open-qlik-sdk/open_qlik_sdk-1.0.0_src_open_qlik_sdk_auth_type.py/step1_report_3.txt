{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for different authentication types (APIKey and OAuth2).",
  "sources": "No external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from input to output; the code only defines a static enum.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The comments may suggest intended use, but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class from the enum module and creates a class 'AuthType' with two enumeration members: 'APIKey' and 'OAuth2'. Each member has an associated string value and descriptive comments. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears to be a straightforward, standard implementation of an enumeration for authentication types.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard definition of an enumeration with no malicious intent or security concerns. It serves as a simple reference for authentication method types.",
