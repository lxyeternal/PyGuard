  "purpose": "Defines authentication types as an enumeration for use in authentication logic.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; static enum members.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; purely static code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward enum with descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Enum class with two string members representing authentication types. It contains no external input, data processing, or network activity. The comments are benign, and the structure is standard. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and clarity lead to high confidence that it is safe. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard enumeration defining authentication types with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its safety, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
