  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is a straightforward enumeration defining two authentication types: `APIKey` and `OAuth2`. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is static, with no external input/output, data flows, or suspicious logic.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign, well-structured, and standard for defining enums. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**  \n   All reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The `obfuscated` score is also 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation. The confidence scores are high (1), reflecting certainty about the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports conclude no security issues, and the code is simple enum declaration, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The same applies to malware scores.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious activity or contain malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   No claims are made based on assumptions; all observations are factual and based on static code analysis.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, standard enum definition for authentication types with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The current scores and conclusions are appropriate.",
