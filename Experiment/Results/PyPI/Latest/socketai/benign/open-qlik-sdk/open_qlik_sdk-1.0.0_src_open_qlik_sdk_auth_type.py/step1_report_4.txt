  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for different types of authentication methods",
  "sources": "N/A - no input or data reading in this code",
  "sinks": "N/A - no data output or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows or processing beyond enum definition",
  "anomalies": "Use of docstrings inside enum members is unconventional but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code creates an Enum class 'AuthType' with two members representing authentication types: APIKey and OAuth2. The enum members are assigned string values, and docstrings provide descriptions. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. There are no external data sources, sinks, or data flows to analyze. The structure and syntax are normal for defining enums in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign enumeration defining authentication types. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation present in the code.",
