  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is a straightforward enumeration with no external input, data processing, or output. The code defines an Enum class `AuthType` with two members, each associated with a string value, and includes descriptive docstrings. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.  \n   **Conclusion**: The code appears benign and correct.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that the code is a simple enum definition with no security concerns. There are no logical errors or flawed reasoning.  \n   **Conclusion**: No errors or flaws are present in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a `malware` score of 0, a `securityRisk` of 0, and a confidence of 1. This aligns well with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features. The obfuscated score is also 0, which is appropriate.  \n   **Suggestion**: The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Since the code is purely defining an enum with no dynamic behavior, external inputs, or sensitive data, higher risk scores are unwarranted.  \n   **Conclusion**: No justification exists for increasing risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   The code does not perform any malicious actions—no code injection, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.  \n   **Conclusion**: The malware score is correctly assigned.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid assumptions; they only describe the code's structure and behavior.  \n   **Conclusion**: No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score**: **0** (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is a simple, standard enum declaration with no security issues or malicious intent.**",
