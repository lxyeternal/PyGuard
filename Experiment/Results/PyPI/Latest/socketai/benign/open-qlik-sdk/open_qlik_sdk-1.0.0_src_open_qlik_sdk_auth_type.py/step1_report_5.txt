  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for authentication types (APIKey and OAuth2).",
  "sources": "The enum class attributes APIKey and OAuth2, which are string values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output or between variables; purely static enum definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for defining enums.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Enum from the enum module, then defines a class AuthType inheriting from Enum with two members: APIKey and OAuth2, each assigned descriptive string values. Comments describe the purpose of each auth type. There are no dynamic or untrusted inputs, no function calls, or complex logic. No signs of malicious or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard enumeration for authentication types with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger application.",
