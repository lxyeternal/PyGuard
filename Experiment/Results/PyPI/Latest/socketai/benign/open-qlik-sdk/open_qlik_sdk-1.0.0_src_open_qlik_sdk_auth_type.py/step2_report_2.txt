  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward enum definition with no external input, data processing, or output.\n   - The code does not contain any malicious logic, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The enum members are simple string constants with descriptive comments, and no suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of data flows, external inputs, or malicious activity.\n   - Some comments mention \"docstrings inside enum members,\" which is slightly unconventional but not problematic or malicious.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are identified or implied.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is 0, aligning with the analysis.\n   - The confidence scores are all at 1, reflecting high certainty that the code is safe.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a static enum declaration with no external interactions or complex logic, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate.\n   - No malicious activity or indicators are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are grounded in direct analysis; no assumptions about malicious intent are made.\n   - The comments about potential misuse are speculative and not supported by evidence.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable adjustments are needed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign enumeration for authentication types.\n- The reports are thorough, accurate, and consistent.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code poses no security threat, and the reports correctly reflect this. No further action or concern is necessary.",
