  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward enumeration defining two authentication types: `APIKey` and `OAuth2`.\n   - The code does not perform any data processing, external input/output, or network operations.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are observed.\n   - The code structure and comments are standard and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a simple enum with no security issues.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - `securityRisk` scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The `obfuscated` scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), which is justified given the code's simplicity and clarity.\n   - No adjustments are necessary for these scores.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk scores are 0, indicating no security concerns.\n   - Since there's no evidence of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity or behaviors.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to observable facts.\n   - The comments about potential use are benign and do not imply malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all are 0 or 1 for confidence, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a standard, benign enumeration with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The high confidence scores are justified, and the lack of any anomalies supports a minimal risk assessment.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The scores accurately reflect the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current scores; the code poses no security threat.",
