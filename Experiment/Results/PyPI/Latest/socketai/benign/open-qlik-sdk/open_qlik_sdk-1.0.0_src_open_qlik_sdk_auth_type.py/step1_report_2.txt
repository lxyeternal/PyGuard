  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for different types of authentication methods",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink as no input/output operations are present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward and well-structured",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class and defines an Enum class 'AuthType' with two members: 'APIKey' and 'OAuth2'. The members are simple string values with descriptive comments. There are no suspicious behaviors, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or external data processing. The comments provide clarification but do not introduce any security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard enumeration definition for authentication types with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
