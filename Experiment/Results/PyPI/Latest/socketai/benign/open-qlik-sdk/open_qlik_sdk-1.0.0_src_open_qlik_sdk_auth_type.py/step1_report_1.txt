  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for different authentication types.",
  "sources": "No external input or data read operations present.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as there are no data processing or input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. Docstrings are straightforward and related to enumeration purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class 'AuthType' with two members, 'APIKey' and 'OAuth2', each associated with descriptive string values. The class is well-structured, contains appropriate docstrings, and does not perform any operations, data handling, or external communications. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple enumeration declaration for authentication types with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is standard, readable, and does not pose any risk.",
