{
  "purpose": "Defines a configuration class for authentication settings with validation logic.",
  "sources": "Initialization (__post_init__), validate() method, access to self.__dict__",
  "sinks": "Potentially raises exceptions, but no data leaks or dangerous actions occur",
  "flows": "Object instantiation triggers validate(), which checks properties and raises exceptions based on conditions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Use of exceptions for validation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a dataclass for configuration with validation to ensure required properties are present based on authentication type. It raises exceptions if properties are missing or unsupported, but does not process untrusted external input directly or execute dangerous operations. No data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious activities are present. The logic is straightforward, focusing on validation logic, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration validation class with no malicious intent or security risks. It correctly checks property dependencies and raises exceptions for invalid configurations without executing any malicious or harmful actions.",
