  "purpose": "Define a configuration data class for authentication settings, including validation logic.",
  "sources": "Input data from external configuration sources (host, auth_type, api_key, client_id, etc.).",
  "sinks": "Potentially raises exceptions when validation fails; no direct data sinks are apparent.",
  "flows": "Input data → __post_init__() → validate() → possible exceptions based on validation checks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; validation logic is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a dataclass for configuration with validation logic that checks for required fields and consistency based on auth_type. It raises custom exceptions if validation fails, which is standard. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. No hardcoded secrets are present; all configuration values are expected to come from external sources. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward configuration class with validation routines. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or malware. It performs typical validation for configuration parameters, raising exceptions on invalid input. Overall, it is safe and not suspicious.",
