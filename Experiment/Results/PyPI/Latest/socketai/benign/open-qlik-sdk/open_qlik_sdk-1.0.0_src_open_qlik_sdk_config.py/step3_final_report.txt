{
  "purpose": "This code defines a configuration data class for authentication settings, validating required properties based on the auth_type and ensuring proper configuration before use.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from class attributes such as host, auth_type, api_key, client_id, client_secret, scope, redirect_url, refresh_token.",
  "sinks": "Raises exceptions upon invalid configuration; no data leaks or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into attribute assignments, then validation logic checks dependencies and raises exceptions if invalid.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward validation logic, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard dataclass with validation logic that enforces required properties based on auth_type. It raises custom exceptions for invalid configurations, such as missing required fields or unsupported properties. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The validation ensures correct configuration but does not perform any harmful actions. The exception handling is typical and does not introduce security risks. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and aligns with best practices for configuration validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration validation class with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The validation logic is standard and does not pose security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal (~0.1), reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
