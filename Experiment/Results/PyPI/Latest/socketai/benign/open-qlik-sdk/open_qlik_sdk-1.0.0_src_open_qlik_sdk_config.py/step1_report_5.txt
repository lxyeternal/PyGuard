{
  "purpose": "Defines a configuration data class for authentication settings, with validation logic for different auth types.",
  "sources": "Input data from instantiation of Config object, possibly external user input for properties like host, auth_type, api_key, client_id, etc.",
  "sinks": "Potential exceptions raised during validation, which could be exploited if not properly handled; no direct data leaks or insecure operations evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from object instantiation to validation checks, including property assignments and conditional logic, with exception raising as output on invalid config.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected; code performs straightforward validation with no hardcoded secrets, network calls, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data class for configuration with validation rules tailored to different authentication types. It raises exceptions for missing or unsupported properties, checks for unsupported properties, and enforces inclusion of 'user_default' scope for OAuth2. No obfuscated logic, malicious operations, or insecure handling detected. Validation logic is standard, focusing on internal state consistency.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration class with validation logic, no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. It mainly ensures correct setup of configuration parameters before use.",
