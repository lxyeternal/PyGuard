{
  "purpose": "Define a configuration object for authentication and connection settings, with validation logic.",
  "sources": "Input data: class attributes initialized at object creation, especially 'host', 'auth_type', 'api_key', 'scope', 'client_secret', 'redirect_url', 'refresh_token'.",
  "sinks": "Validation logic that raises exceptions; no direct data leakage or external effect observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through validation checks; exceptions are raised if invalid. No external network or data exfiltration detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. Validation enforces property constraints properly.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass 'Config' that stores configuration parameters for authentication. It performs validation in '__post_init__' and 'validate' methods, raising exceptions for invalid configurations. The validation checks include presence of host, auth_type, appropriate properties depending on auth_type, and scope inclusion. No external data sources, network operations, or suspicious code patterns are present. The exception messages are descriptive, and property validation appears standard. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The code relies on external modules for exceptions and auth types but does not execute untrusted code or data transformations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard configuration validation for authentication settings without any malicious intent or suspicious activity. It enforces configuration correctness and raises exceptions on invalid setups. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
