{
  "purpose": "Defines a configuration data structure for authentication settings, including validation logic.",
  "sources": "Input data through class instantiation (__init__ via dataclass), specifically the parameters host, auth_type, api_key, client_id, client_secret, scope, redirect_url, refresh_token.",
  "sinks": "Validation logic raises exceptions based on the validity of input data; no external sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into __post_init__, which calls validate(); validation logic checks properties and raises exceptions if invalid.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Validation logic enforces expected configuration structure. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration class with validation for required properties based on authentication type. It uses data classes for structure, enforces constraints, and raises exceptions for invalid configs. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present. The validation process includes typical checks, and the logic appears aligned with secure configuration practices. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a secure configuration validator for authentication settings. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The only potential security concern is improper configuration leading to runtime exceptions, but these are standard validation checks and do not pose security risks. Overall, it is a benign and standard implementation.",
