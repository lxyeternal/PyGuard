  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims, and determine the appropriate scores based on the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Implements WebSocket RPC client with session, interceptors, event handling.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard design; interceptors are flexible but not inherently malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, no malicious signals.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (low, due to general network communication)\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's reasoning is sound. The code appears standard and secure, with no signs of malicious activity. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** WebSocket RPC client, session management, interceptors.\n- **Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard patterns, no backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the reasoning aligns with the code. No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. The risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** WebSocket RPC client, session, interceptors, connection management.\n- **Analysis:** Potential misuse of interceptors if malicious code is injected, but no evidence here. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard implementation, potential misuse if interceptors are compromised.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is cautious but justified. No malicious activity detected. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** WebSocket RPC client, session, interceptors, request handling.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to above; interceptors are flexible but not malicious here. No signs of sabotage.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, with potential risk if interceptors are malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** WebSocket RPC client, request/response, interceptors, connection management.\n- **Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets beyond config, no obfuscation, no code injection, standard patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, well-structured.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is solid. The code is typical for such clients, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Justification**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code analysis. The code does not exhibit any behavior typical of malware (e.g., data exfiltration, command execution, backdoors).\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0.2, indicating a low but non-zero risk primarily due to the use of interceptors and network communication. This is reasonable given the context.\n\n**Critical Points:**\n- The code is a standard WebSocket RPC client.\n- No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.\n- Interceptors are a potential attack vector if malicious code is injected externally, but this is a known risk, not an inherent flaw.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation**\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — low, due to the potential misuse of interceptors and network communication, but not inherently dangerous.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears safe, well-structured, and typical for a WebSocket RPC client. The low risk score is justified, and there is no evidence to raise the malware or obfuscated scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.  \n- No modifications needed.  \n- The overall security posture of this code is sound, with minimal inherent risk.",
