{
  "purpose": "This code implements a WebSocket-based RPC client and session management for communication with a server, including interceptors for request and response handling.",
  "sources": "Reads include parameters from function calls, environment variables for API keys, and network data received from WebSocket responses.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are WebSocket message sending, JSON serialization/deserialization, and network communication which could be exploited if untrusted data is improperly handled.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data from WebSocket responses is processed through interceptors and then returned or triggers events; outgoing data is serialized and sent via WebSocket, with interceptors able to modify requests/responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present; no obfuscated code or unusual control flow; exception handling appears standard. No backdoors or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code handles WebSocket communication, including message serialization/deserialization, connection management, and event handling. The interceptors allow modification of requests/responses, which is standard for such clients. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command injection, or hidden backdoors. The environment variables and API keys are handled properly; no unsafe eval or code execution is present. The code performs typical network communication operations, with appropriate error handling and resource cleanup. The overall design appears to be a typical secure client implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a WebSocket-based RPC client with session and event management, employing standard security practices. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attacks are evident. The code appears safe and well-structured, with no suspicious anomalies.",
