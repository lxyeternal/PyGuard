  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured WebSocket RPC client with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk score appropriately reflects potential misuse of interceptors or configuration issues but does not indicate actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The malware and obfuscated scores are justified as zero. Overall, the code is safe for use in supply chain contexts."
