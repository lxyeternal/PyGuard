{
  "purpose": "The code implements a WebSocket-based RPC client for interacting with a Qlik engine, including session management, interceptors, and event handling.",
  "sources": "Input sources include WebSocket responses, JSON data received from the socket, and parameters passed to methods such as 'send'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include JSON data serialization (json.dumps), WebSocket send method, and execution of interceptors which could modify request/response data.",
  "flows": "Sources like socket messages are parsed into JSON and then processed via event emitters and interceptors. Send method creates RequestObjects, serializes to JSON, and transmits over WebSocket. Response data is received and routed back to waiting threads.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. Use of WebSocket with dynamic headers is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected. No suspicious logic such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or malicious backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a WebSocket-based RPC client with session handling, interceptors, and event management. It uses standard libraries and patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as covert data transmission, backdoors, or secret exfiltration. The data flow from socket responses to JSON parsing and event emission appears typical for real-time communication. Interceptors could theoretically modify data but are part of legitimate customization. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures detected. The overall design is typical for a client library interfacing with a WebSocket-based backend.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate WebSocket RPC client implementation with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behaviors. It follows standard patterns for such clients, and no suspicious or malicious signals are identified.",
