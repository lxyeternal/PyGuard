  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the __version__ variable for package identification.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only assigns a static string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard practice in Python packages to declare versioning. It contains no inputs, outputs, network activity, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version string assignment with no malicious or security concerns. The scores and assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
