  "purpose": "Declare the version string for the package or module.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; no data input or external sources are read.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, network communication, or file writing is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only assigns a version string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; simply assigning a string to a variable with a version indicator. No suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version label 'v0.17.0' to the variable '__version__'. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. It is a standard practice in Python modules to define a version string this way. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious behavior or security issues.",
