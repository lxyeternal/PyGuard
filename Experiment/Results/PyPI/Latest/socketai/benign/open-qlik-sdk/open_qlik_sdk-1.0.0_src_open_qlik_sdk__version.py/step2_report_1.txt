  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or complex logic.\n   - No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies are present.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and standard for Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the code as trivial and non-malicious.\n   - No logical flaws or errors are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports confidently identify the code as harmless, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The scores of 0 are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the code's benign nature.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward analysis; no unwarranted assumptions are present.\n   - The reports correctly interpret the code as standard.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard version string assignment with no malicious or security concerns.**",
