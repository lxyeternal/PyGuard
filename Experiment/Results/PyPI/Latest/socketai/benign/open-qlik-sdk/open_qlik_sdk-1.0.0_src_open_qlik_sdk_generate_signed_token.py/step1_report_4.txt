  "purpose": "Generate a signed JWT token for authentication and authorization purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'crt' (private key), user details, and configuration values.",
  "sinks": "jwt.encode() function which outputs the signed token, potentially exposing token creation logic.",
  "flows": "Input data (private key, claims) flows into jwt.encode() which produces a signed JWT token.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; use of random.choices for jti is low entropy but not malicious; no obfuscated code or misleading patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code creates JWT claims based on input parameters, including user information and token metadata. It uses 'jwt.encode()' to sign the token with a provided private key. The private key is expected as a string input, which could be sensitive if mishandled but is standard for JWT signing. The '_generate_id' function uses 'random.choices' for 'jti' with limited entropy, but this does not indicate malicious intent. The code lacks any network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoor mechanisms. No suspicious code patterns, such as dynamic code execution or obfuscation, are present. Overall, the code appears to be a standard utility for token generation with no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical JWT signing utility with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It correctly generates and signs tokens based on provided inputs, with no evidence of backdoors or malicious data leaks.",
