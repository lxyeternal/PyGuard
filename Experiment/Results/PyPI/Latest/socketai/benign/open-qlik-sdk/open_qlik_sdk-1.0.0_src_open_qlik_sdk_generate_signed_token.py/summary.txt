  "conclusion": "The code is a standard JWT signing utility with no malware or obfuscation. The primary security risk stems from accepting the private key as a string without validation and the weak randomness for 'jti'. These issues do not constitute malicious activity but warrant caution. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and a risk score of 0.3 appropriately reflects the potential for misuse if 'crt' is sourced insecurely."
