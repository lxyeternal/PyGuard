{
  "purpose": "The code generates a signed JWT token using provided user and issuer information, primarily for authentication purposes in an external system.",
  "sources": "User-provided inputs: crt, sub, sub_type, name, email, expires_in, not_before, issuer, keyid, email_verified, jti, groups, algorithm, audience",
  "sinks": "jwt.encode() function which signs the token with the provided private key; potential output exposure if token is logged or mishandled",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assembled into claims; claims are encoded and signed with the private key, producing the JWT token",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious network or file I/O; usage of random.choices for ID generation is not inherently malicious but weak for cryptographic purposes; the code does not perform any harmful actions",
  "analysis": "The script generates a JWT with claims provided by parameters. It uses jwt.encode() for signing with a private key supplied as a string, which is standard for token creation. The _generate_id function uses random.choices, which is not cryptographically secure, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. The code does not contain network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. All data flows are within the function scope, with user inputs only used for claims and token signing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard JWT token generator that relies on external inputs for claims and signing key. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security violations. Its purpose appears legitimate for authentication workflows. The only minor concern is the use of non-cryptographically secure ID generation, but this does not imply malicious intent.",
