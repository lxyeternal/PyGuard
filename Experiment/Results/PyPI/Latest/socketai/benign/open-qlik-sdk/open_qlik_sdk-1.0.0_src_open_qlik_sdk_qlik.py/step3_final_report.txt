{
  "purpose": "This code defines the Qlik SDK class, importing various modules and initializing API service attributes with a configuration object to facilitate interaction with the Qlik platform.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data during initialization and imports modules; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data, perform network communication, or lead to data leaks within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the configuration object into API module instances and class attributes; no external data flows or network activity are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. Deprecated attributes are simple aliases, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK class setup, importing modules and initializing attributes based on a configuration object. It contains no network activity, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. Deprecated attributes are harmless aliases. The code is clear, well-structured, and consistent with standard SDK initialization practices. No security issues, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK class definition with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to deprecated attribute aliases. Overall, it is a safe and legitimate implementation.",
