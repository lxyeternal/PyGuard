  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code initializes the SDK class, importing modules and setting attributes based on configuration.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. Deprecated attributes are just aliases.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears to be standard SDK setup with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low, likely due to deprecated aliases).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the structure and lack of malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on the SDK class, import modules, and attribute initialization.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Highlights configuration-based initialization, no external or untrusted data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Summarizes the code as a typical SDK setup with no external communication or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None of the reports identify any malicious code, such as code injection, network communication with untrusted sources, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward class and attribute initialization.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** The code is primarily SDK setup; it doesn't process user input or handle sensitive data directly. The deprecated attributes are harmless aliases.\n- **Scores Justification:**\n  - **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n  - **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n  - **Risk Score:** The low risk scores (~0.1) are appropriate, reflecting minimal security concern due to deprecated aliases but no real security threat.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minor due to deprecated aliases, but overall very low.\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n\n- The presence of deprecated attributes should be maintained or cleaned up in future versions to reduce confusion but does not pose a security risk.\n- The code's purpose is SDK setup, not data processing or network communication, reducing attack surface.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a standard, well-structured SDK class definition with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The low risk score is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at zero.\n\n**Recommended final scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, if considering deprecated attributes as negligible risk)\n\nIf I were to assign the final scores myself, I would set:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to deprecated attributes, but not malicious)\n\nOverall, the code appears safe and legitimate.",
