{
  "purpose": "Defines the Qlik SDK class as an entry point for interacting with various Qlik Cloud APIs, including configuration, authentication, and service modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .apis, .auth, .config, .rest, .rpc, and the initialization of class attributes using these modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks involving untrusted input, network connections, or data exfiltration points are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The class initializes API service modules with provided configuration, and the auth object provides REST and RPC interfaces for further interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are detected. The code mainly consists of class definitions, imports, and attribute initializations.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes the structure of a SDK class for Qlik's platform, importing modules, and initializing service attributes with the configuration object. There are deprecated attribute aliases, but they do not pose malicious risks. No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or network connections are evident. The design appears standard for a SDK setup, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward SDK class definition for the Qlik platform, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly initializes service modules and interfaces for further use, with no suspicious data flows or anomalies.",
