{
  "purpose": "Defines the main Qlik SDK class for interacting with Qlik Cloud APIs and services.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes for API access, configuration, authentication, and RPC communication.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data, no network, file, or system command execution found.",
  "flows": "Constructor initializes various API components with configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Multiple deprecated attributes, but they are simple aliasing.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a structured SDK class with multiple API components. It imports modules, defines a class with detailed docstrings, and initializes numerous attributes with provided configuration objects. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network connections, or data exfiltration. Deprecated attributes are just aliases, not malicious. Overall, the code is straightforward SDK setup code, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard SDK initializer for Qlik platform interaction. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. All components are standard for such SDKs, with no suspicious code or behaviors.",
