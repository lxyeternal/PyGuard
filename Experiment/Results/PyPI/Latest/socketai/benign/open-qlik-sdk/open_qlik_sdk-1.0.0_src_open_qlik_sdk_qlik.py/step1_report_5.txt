{
  "purpose": "Defines the Qlik class as an SDK entry point, initializing various API modules for interacting with the Qlik platform.",
  "sources": "Imports from .apis, .auth, .config, .rest, .rpc modules, and class attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data processing or external communication shown within this code.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of the Qlik class initializes attributes from configuration, creating API clients. No data flows or external requests occur in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors. Multiple attributes are deprecated but harmless. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements, class definition with detailed docstrings, and attribute initializations in the constructor. All imports are from internal modules. The class initializes multiple API client objects, passing the configuration object. There are deprecated attributes, but they are simply re-initialized versions of current attributes. No input handling, external network calls, or sensitive data processing is visible. The structure appears standard for SDK setup code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical SDK setup class with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply organizes API clients for the Qlik platform, with no external data flows or harmful behaviors.",
