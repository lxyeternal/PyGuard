  "purpose": "Abstract base class for cache management, handling save/load, auto-save, cache state, and filesystem interactions.",
  "sources": "Filesystem paths for cache files, internal cache data structures, hasher factory function.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem write/delete operations, cache data serialization/deserialization.",
  "flows": "Cache data is generated/modified in memory, then saved to or loaded from filesystem; cache state is converted to/from serializable form.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected; straightforward filesystem and cache handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard abstract cache class with methods for cache creation, saving, loading, and auto-save management. It uses common libraries and patterns, with no network activity or obfuscation. The security implications are minimal; the filesystem operations are typical for cache handling. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present. The code's design and implementation are consistent with safe, supply chain-friendly practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard cache management framework with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It is suitable for supply chain deployment, assuming subclasses implement the abstract methods securely.",
