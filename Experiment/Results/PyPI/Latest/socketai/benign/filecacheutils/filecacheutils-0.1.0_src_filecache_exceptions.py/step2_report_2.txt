  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code only consists of two class definitions inheriting from Exception, with no input, output, or processing logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is benign and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They emphasize the minimal and standard nature of the code, correctly noting the absence of suspicious activity or security concerns. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious intent or behavior.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports agree on zero for malware and security risk, and the code is just class definitions, there is no reason to assign higher scores. The code is entirely benign.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   No signs of malicious activity are present—no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious imports or network calls. The malware score remains at 0.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code's simplicity and lack of behavior beyond class definitions.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is purely definitional, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concern elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Overall recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
