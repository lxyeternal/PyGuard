  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for state not found errors and database read errors.",
  "sources": "No data input sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output points present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input/output, or execution flow beyond class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of class declarations for exceptions; no suspicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception. There are no function calls, data handling, or security-sensitive operations. The classes are empty, serving as specific error types, which is standard practice in Python. No hidden or obfuscated behavior, no use of dynamic code execution, nor hardcoded secrets are present. The code does not exhibit any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply declares two custom exception classes with no malicious or suspicious elements. It poses no security risk and appears to be straightforward, standard exception definitions.",
