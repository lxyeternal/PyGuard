  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions related to state not found and database read errors.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only defines exception classes without any data processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present since the code only declares exception classes without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior; the code consists solely of class declarations inheriting from Exception.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. There are no data inputs, outputs, or complex logic. The classes are placeholders for error handling, which is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, standard, and harmless, serving solely to define custom exceptions without any malicious intent or security risks.",
