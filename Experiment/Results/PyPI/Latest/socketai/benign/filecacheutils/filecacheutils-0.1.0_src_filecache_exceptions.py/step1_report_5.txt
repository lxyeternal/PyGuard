  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions related to state not found and database read errors.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are present, as this is just class definitions for exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code elements are present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two custom exception class definitions with no additional logic or attributes. These classes serve as markers for specific error conditions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. The code is minimal, straightforward, and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be standard practice for custom exception handling in Python.",
