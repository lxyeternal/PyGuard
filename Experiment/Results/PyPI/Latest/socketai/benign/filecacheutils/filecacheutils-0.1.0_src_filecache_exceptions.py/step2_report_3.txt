  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:\n   - The original code consists solely of two class definitions inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - No input, data processing, external interactions, or runtime logic is present.\n   - The code is minimal and straightforward, serving as custom exception classes.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that there are no issues, anomalies, or suspicious behavior.\n   - No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected.\n   - The code is benign and standard for defining custom exceptions.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly state that there are no anomalies, malicious intent, or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n4. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification**:\n   - Since there's no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security risk, the scores of 0 are justified.\n   - The code does not perform any harmful actions, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports are cautious and based on factual analysis, avoiding unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as purely definitional.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the analysis.\n\n8. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is safe, standard, and contains no security issues.\n   - The scores of `malware`, `obfuscated`, and `securityRisk` should remain at 0.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a minimal, standard pattern for defining custom exceptions. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and is free of vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and justified in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: No changes are necessary; the current scoring and analysis are appropriate.",
