{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for state not found and database read errors.",
  "sources": "None, as the code only defines exception classes without input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None, no data processing or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow since there are no input or processing actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and standard for defining exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two class definitions inheriting from Exception, used for custom error handling. No input sources, data manipulation, or external interactions are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code appears to be a straightforward setup for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, merely defining custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks involved.",
