  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only defines two custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`. There are no input sources, data flows, or processing logic. The code is minimal and standard for exception handling, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. Therefore, **no issues are present** in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly note the absence of data handling, external interactions, or suspicious constructs. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident. The summaries are thorough and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- `obfuscated`: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's straightforward nature.  \n- `malware`: All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no malicious intent.  \n- `securityRisk`: All reports assign 0, which is reasonable since the code does not introduce any security concerns.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports assign a security risk of 0, there is no justification needed for higher scores. The code is benign.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nAll reports assign malware score 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nThe reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code as purely definitional with no security implications.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is entirely benign, serving only as a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, thorough, and consistent. No modifications are necessary. The code poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores should remain at zero across all categories.",
