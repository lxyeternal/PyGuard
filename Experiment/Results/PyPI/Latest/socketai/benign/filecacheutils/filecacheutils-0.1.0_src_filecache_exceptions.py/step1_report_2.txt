{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling related to state not found and database read errors.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading occurs in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as no runtime data processing is present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only class definitions with no implementation or logic; extremely minimal code with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two class declarations inheriting from Exception, used for error handling. There are no data processing, input/output operations, or any suspicious constructs. The code does not perform any actions, network communication, or data manipulation. It appears to be a standard pattern for custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to define custom exception types. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
