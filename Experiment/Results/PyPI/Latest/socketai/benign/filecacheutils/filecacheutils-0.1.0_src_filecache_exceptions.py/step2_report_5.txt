  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\nThe provided code snippet only defines two custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`. There are no data inputs, outputs, processing, or external interactions. The classes are empty, serving solely as error markers.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. The code only defines exception classes with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Are the errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify the code as benign, minimal, and standard for exception handling.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign `malware` and `obfuscated` scores as 0, and `securityRisk` as 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of each report:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n- **Purpose & Analysis:**  \n  All reports accurately state that the code only defines exception classes with no input/output, data processing, or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Logic & reasoning:**  \n  The reasoning is sound. The code is minimal, standard, and harmless.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  All assign `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0`, and confidence=1. These are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Since there's no evidence of malicious code, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, so 0 is correct.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  No security risk is present; the code is purely definitional.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code poses no security threat or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and their scores are reasonable. The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
