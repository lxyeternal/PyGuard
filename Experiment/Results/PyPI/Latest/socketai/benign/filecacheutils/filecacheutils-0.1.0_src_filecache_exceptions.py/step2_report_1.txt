  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided reports and the original code.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n- The original code only defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception.\n- No input, data processing, external interactions, or malicious code present.\n- All reports correctly identify this as benign, standard practice, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**:\n- All reports are consistent in stating that the code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident in their reasoning; they correctly interpret the purpose and nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n- All reports assign:\n  - confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Justification**:\n- Since the code is only defining exception classes with no malicious behavior, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- The security risk score is also correctly at 0, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n- All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are made without evidence.\n\n6. **Score Consistency**:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Summary of my assessment**:\n- The code is a straightforward, benign definition of custom exceptions.\n- The malware score should remain at **0**.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at **0**.\n- The security risk score should stay at **0**.\n\n**Final estimation**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's actual content.",
