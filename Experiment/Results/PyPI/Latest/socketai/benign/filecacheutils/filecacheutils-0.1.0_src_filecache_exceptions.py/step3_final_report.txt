{
  "purpose": "Defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, serving as error markers.",
  "sources": "Class definitions; no input, data reading, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are merely definitions with no runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for exception classes.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains two class definitions inheriting from Exception with no processing logic, external interactions, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the benign and standard nature of this code. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security concerns. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
