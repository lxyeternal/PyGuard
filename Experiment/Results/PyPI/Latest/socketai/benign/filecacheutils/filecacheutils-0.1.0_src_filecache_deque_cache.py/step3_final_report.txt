  "purpose": "A cache utility that stores items in deques with dynamically adjustable maximum size and customizable comparison functions, built upon an invalidation dictionary.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, internal data structures (deques, dictionary keys)",
  "sinks": "Internal modifications to deques, no external data leaks or network activity",
  "flows": "Accessing cache via keys, finding items with comparison functions, updating deque order",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'extendleft' with 'reversed()' is unusual but valid; no malicious indicators",
  "analysis": "The code implements a cache with flexible size and comparison logic, using standard Python deque operations. No external data exfiltration, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The use of 'extendleft' with 'reversed()' is syntactically correct in Python 3.5+ but less common, possibly a typo or unconventional usage. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are present. The comparison functions are user-supplied, which could be exploited if misused externally, but within this code, they are parameters, not embedded malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cache utility with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The slightly elevated risk score reflects the potential misuse of user-supplied comparison functions but does not indicate actual malicious intent.",
