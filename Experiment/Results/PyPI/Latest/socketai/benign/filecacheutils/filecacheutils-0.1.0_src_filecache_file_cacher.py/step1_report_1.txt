{
  "purpose": "A file cache system that tracks the hash digests of files to detect changes or modifications.",
  "sources": "File input via open(file, \"rb\") in hash_file; file paths provided as arguments in hash_files.",
  "sinks": "Hash computation using hashlib.file_digest; storing hash digests in cache; file path manipulations.",
  "flows": "File data flows from disk into hash_file's open/read, then into hashlib for digest; cache stores file paths mapped to digests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of hashlib.file_digest is appropriate and secure; no obfuscated code or unusual logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads files from disk via open, hashes their content with hashlib.file_digest, and stores the results in a cache. Path manipulations are straightforward, with relative path calculations for cache export. No untrusted data from external sources beyond file system interactions; no network operations or suspicious behaviors detected. The code appears to be a standard implementation of file hashing and cache management, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of a file hashing cache. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident based on the code provided.",
