  "purpose": "A caching system that tracks the state of files using their hash digest, primarily for change detection.",
  "sources": "File input from open() calls; Path objects from the filesystem; Hash computation via hashlib.file_digest.",
  "sinks": "Hash digest storage in self.cache; Potential file access points for hashing.",
  "flows": "File content read from disk -> hash digest computed -> stored in cache -> cache comparison.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hashlib.file_digest, which is standard; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious network activity; no obfuscated code; no unusual dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs file hashing and cache management with standard libraries and straightforward logic. It reads files to compute their hashes, which is a normal operation for file change detection. The only external point is hashing file content with hashlib.file_digest, which is a standard and safe method. No untrusted input handling beyond file reading, and no network or system modification code present. No suspicious code structures or behavior are evident. The code appears to be a typical file cache tracking implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate file caching utility for tracking file changes using hashes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this module. It operates solely on local file system data without external communications or secret handling.",
