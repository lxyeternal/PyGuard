{
  "purpose": "A file cache that tracks the state of files using their hash digest to detect changes.",
  "sources": "Reads files from disk in hash_file() via open(file, 'rb') and possibly directory paths in expand_directories().",
  "sinks": "Hash computation in hashlib.file_digest(), cache assignment self.cache[file], and path manipulation for relative paths.",
  "flows": "Input paths are expanded, matched, and then hashed via hash_file(). Hash results are stored in self.cache. Cache comparison involves comparing hash values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Use of hashlib.file_digest() is a standard secure hashing method; no obfuscation or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code reads files from disk to compute hashes, which is typical for a file tracker. It uses standard libraries and patterns for cache management. No evidence of malicious behavior or covert data exfiltration. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present. The hashing process appears secure, and path manipulations are straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a file change detector using hashes with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs standard cache management and file hashing operations safely.",
