  "purpose": "Track the state of files by their hash digest to detect changes.",
  "sources": "File open/read operations, path expansions, match pattern checks",
  "sinks": "Hash digest computation, cache updates",
  "flows": "Reading file -> hashing with hashlib.file_digest() -> storing digest in cache",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no network activity",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file hashing and cache management using secure methods. It reads files, computes their hashes with hashlib.file_digest(), and stores the results. Path manipulations are straightforward, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or network activity. The security risk score of approximately 0.1 is justified by the minimal inherent risk of file handling operations. Malware score is zero, consistent with the benign nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of a file hashing cache system. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, with appropriate scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1. No adjustments are necessary.",
