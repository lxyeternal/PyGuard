  "purpose": "A file cache that tracks the state of files via their hash digests, allowing detection of changes.",
  "sources": "File reading operations in `hash_file()` which opens files in binary mode.",
  "sinks": "Hash digest computation with `hashlib.file_digest()`, storage of hashes in the cache, and cache comparison.",
  "flows": "Input files are read in `hash_file()`, hashed with `hashlib.file_digest()`, and stored in the cache. The cache can be compared with other caches to detect changes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or obfuscated code. Use of `hashlib.file_digest()` is standard for hashing files.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward file hashing and caching mechanism. It uses standard libraries and methods for reading files and computing hashes. No external data is transmitted, and there are no signs of malicious behavior. The `hash_file()` method securely hashes file contents. The methods facilitate cache management and comparison without executing or executing external commands. No obfuscation or suspicious code structures are present. The code appears to serve its intended purpose without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a file hashing cache with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It performs safe file reading and hashing, with no suspicious network or system interactions.",
