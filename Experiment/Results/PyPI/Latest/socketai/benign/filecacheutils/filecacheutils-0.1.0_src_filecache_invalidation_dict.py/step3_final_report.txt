  "purpose": "A time-based cache invalidation dictionary that tracks last access times for keys to remove outdated data.",
  "sources": "Initialization, get_and_update, set_and_update methods, and internal timestamp updates.",
  "sinks": "Key deletion in invalidate, invalidate_old_data, and __delitem__ methods.",
  "flows": "Accessing a key updates its timestamp; invalidation compares current time with stored timestamps to remove stale entries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward implementation with standard library usage.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a subclass of dict that tracks last access times per key for cache invalidation. It uses datetime with timezone for timestamps, validates 'valid_for' periods, and provides methods to update access times and invalidate old data. No external network, file I/O, or obfuscation is present. The logic is clear, with proper validation and no hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for time-based cache invalidation with no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. It is safe for use in security-sensitive contexts.",
