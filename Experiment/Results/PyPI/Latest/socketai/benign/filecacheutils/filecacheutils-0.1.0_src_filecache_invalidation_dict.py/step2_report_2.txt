  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward cache invalidation dictionary with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The security risk score is low, justified by the nature of cache invalidation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing legitimate time-based cache invalidation with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious or obfuscated code. The low security risk is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a benign cache with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. The security risk score remains low, justified by the lack of external communication or malicious logic.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code as a legitimate time-based invalidation cache with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.2) but still justified given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly higher risk score is acceptable; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others—benign cache invalidation with no malicious features.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is straightforward and safe.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary and Final Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; malware=0 is justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; obfuscated=0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose (cache invalidation) and lack of external interactions, the risk scores (mostly 0.1–0.2) are reasonable.\n\n### My Final Estimate\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — No signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — Low, due to potential misuse (e.g., deleting data), but generally safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code. No adjustments necessary.",
