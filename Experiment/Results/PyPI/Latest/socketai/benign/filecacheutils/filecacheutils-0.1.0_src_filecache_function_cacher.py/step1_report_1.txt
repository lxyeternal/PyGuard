  "purpose": "The code implements a caching mechanism for functions, allowing for cache saving/loading and potentially optimizing repeated function calls.",
  "sources": "Function arguments (`args`, `kwargs`) in `lookup_function`, `__call__`, and wrapper functions; function hashes generated from function objects; cache data stored in `self.cache`.",
  "sinks": "Return values from cached functions; cache data being loaded or overwritten; deep copies of output data; potential access to cache entries based on function hashes and arguments.",
  "flows": "Function invocation -> lookup_function (source) -> cache lookup -> return cached output or compute -> cache update -> output (sink); cache loading or overwriting flows between cache states and data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deep copies to return cached outputs; no hardcoded credentials or secrets present; use of external utils and cache mechanisms appear standard; no obfuscated code or unusual control flows.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a caching wrapper for functions, with cache persistence features. It uses function hashes to identify cache entries and deep copies to prevent data leakage or unintended mutations. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Use of external utility modules appears standard for cache hashing, comparison, and inspection. The code primarily performs standard caching operations with no suspicious modifications or data leaks. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious data handling routines. The deep copy approach is typical for cache safety. Overall, it looks like a legitimate caching class with no indications of malware or malicious intent.",
