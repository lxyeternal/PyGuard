  "purpose": "A function caching class that wraps functions to cache their outputs, with capabilities to save and load cache data from files.",
  "sources": "Function arguments, function hash computation, cache data storage, cache load/save operations.",
  "sinks": "Return of cached outputs, cache file loading, deep copying of outputs to prevent mutation.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are hashed and bound, cache is checked for existing output, if absent, function executes and output is cached; cache can be saved or loaded from files.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious external calls or network activity. Use of external modules for hashing and comparison is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a typical function cache with optional persistence. It uses hashing for identifying function calls, deep copies outputs to prevent side effects, and manages cache size and validity. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected. The cache load/save mechanisms are standard but could be exploited if cache files are tampered with, which is a common consideration for such utilities. The code structure and logic are straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard function caching utility with no signs of malware or malicious sabotage. The security risk primarily relates to cache file integrity, which is a typical concern but not indicative of malicious activity.",
