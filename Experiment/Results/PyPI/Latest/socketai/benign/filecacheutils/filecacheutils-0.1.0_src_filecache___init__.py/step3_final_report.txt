  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code execution points, input handling, environment variable reads, external data flows.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variables, logs, external modules.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing, function calls, environment reads, external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "All provided reports correctly identify benign code with no malicious indicators. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the descriptions. Risk scores are uniformly low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern, which aligns with the benign nature of the code snippets. Confidence levels are high, appropriate for the assessments. No evidence suggests malicious activity or obfuscation, and the reasoning is sound across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are accurate and consistent; the code appears safe with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The risk scores could be slightly lowered to 0.1 for increased precision, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the dependency is deemed secure based on the provided information.",
