  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform standard functionality, possibly related to data processing or utility operations, with no explicit malicious intent evident.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external inputs such as user inputs or configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to logs, possibly transmitted over the network, or stored in variables. No clear insecure sinks like SQL or command execution are detected.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or inputs flows through functions, but no suspicious or unusual data flows leading to insecure sinks are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are observed. No obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or hidden network communications are detected. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and performs typical operations. There are no signs of malicious code such as network exfiltration, data theft, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries is conventional. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present in code flow or structure. All data handling appears normal with no hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and safe for use. The malware score is low, and the security risk is minimal.",
