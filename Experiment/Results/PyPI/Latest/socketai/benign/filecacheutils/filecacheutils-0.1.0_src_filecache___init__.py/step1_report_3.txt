  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be related to data processing or utility functions, but it is not explicitly clear from the provided fragment.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly from imported modules or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or database queries, but specific actions are not clearly identified in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input parameters through various functions or operations, potentially reaching sinks like network or storage actions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs; the code appears straightforward. However, lack of complete context limits certainty.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python constructs with typical library functions. No obfuscated code, malicious network connections, or suspicious data handling are evident. Since the snippet is incomplete, detailed analysis of data flow is limited. No signs of malware or malicious intent are apparent in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign but incomplete information restricts full assessment.",
