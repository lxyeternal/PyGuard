{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import a HASH object from an internal hashlib module and define a type alias for it.",
  "sources": "Import from _hashlib, which is an internal module; the aliasing line that attempts to define Hasher as HASH.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import of HASH from _hashlib; alias assignment (invalid syntax).",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal _hashlib module; invalid Python syntax with 'type Hasher = HASH'; minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports HASH from an internal module, which is unconventional and potentially suspicious. The line 'type Hasher = HASH' is invalid in Python; proper aliasing should be 'Hasher = HASH'. The syntax resembles other languages and suggests obfuscation or mistake. No malicious activity, data leakage, or network activity is evident. The use of internal modules warrants caution but does not constitute malicious behavior. The syntax error indicates possible obfuscation or misconfiguration but not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is syntactically invalid and uses internal modules, which could be suspicious. However, there is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The primary concern is the syntax error and unconventional import, which should be corrected. Overall, the code poses low security risk but warrants review for proper syntax and module usage.",
