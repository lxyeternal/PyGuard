{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define a type alias for HASH from the _hashlib module, likely intended for cryptographic hashing functions.",
  "sources": "Import statement from _hashlib import HASH",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious constructs or hidden behavior. The use of _hashlib (a private module) could be unconventional, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports HASH from the internal _hashlib module, which is a private implementation detail of the hashlib library. It then defines a type alias Hasher for HASH. There are no inputs, no data processing, no network activity, or other typical malicious indicators. The usage of a private module could be considered unusual but does not constitute malicious behavior by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily defines a type alias for internal hashing structures. There is no evidence of malware or suspicious activity.",
