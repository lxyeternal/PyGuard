  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the details provided.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as a TVMaze API client with retry logic, connection pooling, and logging. Reads config from a module.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are straightforward, with no untrusted data influencing system state beyond API responses.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report concludes the code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (minimal).\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is standard, secure, and does not exhibit malicious traits.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing straightforward API interactions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are safe, with proper JSON handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code patterns or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Confirms the code is a typical API client with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code appears benign and well-implemented.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar description, focusing on data fetching.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data manipulation beyond API requests.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. The code remains a standard, safe API client.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a standard API client with retry logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows through request and JSON parsing.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; the code is secure.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others, describing an API client with retries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Proper handling of responses.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is consistent across reports; no malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with their conclusions.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the code's benign nature, low risk scores (0.1–0.2) are appropriate.\n- **Malware score justification:** The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity or payloads are evident.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only minor concern could be reliance on external 'config' data, but nothing malicious is indicated.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, standard, and readable.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, primarily related to external configuration, which is typical.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a well-implemented, standard API client with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports are consistent and accurate.",
