{
  "purpose": "Client for interacting with the TV Maze API with enhanced retry logic, connection pooling, and logging.",
  "sources": "Configuration import for API base URL and retry parameters; request responses from the API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Response JSON data handling, error logging, and potentially untrusted response content that is processed or logged.",
  "flows": "API request initiated in _make_request; response received and JSON parsed; data returned to caller functions like get_shows, get_show_details, etc.",
  "anomalies": "Use of configuration values for retries and backoff factors; logging statements; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard API client with retry and connection pooling via requests library. It uses logging for debug and info levels. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code patterns are present. It correctly handles response statuses, JSON decoding, and logs errors appropriately. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The only potential concern is verbose logging, but it is not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard API client with robust retry logic and logging, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe based on the provided content.",
