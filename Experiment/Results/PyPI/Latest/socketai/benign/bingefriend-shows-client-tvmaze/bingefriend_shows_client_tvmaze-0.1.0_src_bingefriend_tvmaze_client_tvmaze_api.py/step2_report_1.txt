  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence or absence of issues, and evaluate the scoring and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as a TVMaze API client with retries and connection pooling. Sources are from 'config' and standard API calls.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are standard; no suspicious data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report concludes the code is well-structured, with no malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 is reasonable, given minimal operational risk but acknowledging that API clients inherently have some exposure.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are safe; no untrusted data influencing system state beyond API interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is a straightforward API client with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, consistent with the findings.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2, slightly higher than Report 1, but still low, reflecting minimal operational risk.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, standard API client description.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2, consistent with previous reports.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard description.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Typical API request and response handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is a standard API client with no malicious signs.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, matching the analysis.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1, indicating very low operational risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as an API client.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious activity, consistent with previous reports.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1, appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** Range from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal operational risk, which seems appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — low, but not zero, considering the code's function and external dependencies.\n\n**Note:** No suspicious code patterns, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-implemented API client with best practices.\n\n---\n\n**Summary conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and accurate. The scores align with the code's characteristics. No adjustments are necessary.",
