{
  "purpose": "Client for interacting with the TV Maze API with robust retry logic, connection pooling, and logging.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from 'config' module; makes HTTP GET requests to API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "API responses processed; no untrusted data influences system state beyond API responses.",
  "flows": "Source: API request parameters; Sink: JSON responses processed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard API client implementing retries, connection pooling, and logging. It handles responses appropriately, with error handling and JSON decoding. No malicious or suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External 'config' reliance is typical and not suspicious. The code does not perform any malicious actions or data exfiltration. The scoring aligns with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented API client with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal operational risk.",
