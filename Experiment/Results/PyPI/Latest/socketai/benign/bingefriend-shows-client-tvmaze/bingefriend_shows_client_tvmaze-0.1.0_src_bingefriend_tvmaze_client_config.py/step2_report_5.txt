  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code content review:**\n   - The code imports `os` and reads three environment variables:\n     - `'TVMAZE_API_BASE_URL'` with default `'https://api.tvmaze.com'`\n     - `'MAX_API_RETRIES'` with default `5`, converted to int\n     - `'API_RETRY_BACKOFF_FACTOR'` with default `0.5`, converted to float\n   - The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no data processing, no network activity beyond configuration, and no obfuscated patterns.\n   - No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data are present.\n   - The environment variables are used for configuration, which is standard practice.\n\n2. **Assessment of the reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is a simple, standard configuration snippet.\n   - They note the absence of suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty.\n   - Malware scores are all 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n3. **Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - No report suggests any actual vulnerability, malicious intent, or suspicious pattern.\n   - The scores assigned seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Any concerns or points to challenge:**\n   - Since the code only reads environment variables and assigns defaults, there's no apparent risk.\n   - Environment variables could be manipulated externally, but this is standard for configuration and not inherently malicious.\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Score justification:**\n   - Malware score remains at 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n   - Obfuscated score remains at 0.\n   - Risk score is 0, which is appropriate for a configuration snippet with no vulnerabilities.\n\n6. **Overall conclusion:**\n   - The code is safe, standard, and free from malicious behavior.\n   - The reports are accurate and well-founded.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| 0 | 0 | 0 |\n\nThe code is a typical configuration setup with no security issues.",
