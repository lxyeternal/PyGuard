  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a straightforward configuration setup that reads environment variables to set API base URL and retry parameters.\n- The code is simple, with no dynamic code execution, no data processing beyond variable assignment, and no obfuscation.\n- Environment variables are used as intended for configuration, with default values provided.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or malicious code are present.\n- The reports consistently assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - No issues or vulnerabilities are evident. The code is a standard configuration pattern.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, and confidence = 1.\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code does not perform any suspicious actions, these scores are justified as 0.\n\n5. **Malware score:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly interpret the code as safe; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- While environment variables can be manipulated, in this context, they are used only for configuration with safe defaults.\n- No evidence suggests that environment variables are being exploited maliciously in this code snippet.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, straightforward, and correctly scored.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard configuration snippet.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- Scores of 0 for malware and obfuscated, and 0 for risk, are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
