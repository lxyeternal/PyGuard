  "purpose": "Configuration setup for TVMaze API client, establishing base URL and retry parameters from environment variables.",
  "sources": "os.getenv() calls retrieving environment variables: 'TVMAZE_API_BASE_URL', 'MAX_API_RETRIES', 'API_RETRY_BACKOFF_FACTOR'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only reads environment variables without passing untrusted data to system commands, file writes, or network calls directly.",
  "flows": "Environment variable values are assigned to constants; no flow from untrusted input to critical operations is present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for configuration is standard; no suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'os' module and retrieves three environment variables, providing default values if they are not set. The variables are converted to int or float types. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated patterns, or insecure practices. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration setup for an API client.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple and standard configuration setup for an API client, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It properly uses environment variables for configurable parameters, reducing hardcoded secrets or credentials.",
