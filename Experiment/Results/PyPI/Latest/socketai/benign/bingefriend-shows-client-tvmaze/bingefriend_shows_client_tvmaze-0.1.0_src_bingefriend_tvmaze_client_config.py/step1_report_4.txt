  "purpose": "Configure API client settings for TVMaze using environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'TVMAZE_API_BASE_URL', 'MAX_API_RETRIES', 'API_RETRY_BACKOFF_FACTOR'.",
  "sinks": "None detected; environment variables are used only for configuration, no data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at runtime to set configuration constants; no flow from untrusted input to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard environment variable usage for configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os' to read environment variables, assigning defaults if variables are not set. It retrieves 'TVMAZE_API_BASE_URL' as a URL string, 'MAX_API_RETRIES' as an integer, and 'API_RETRY_BACKOFF_FACTOR' as a float. No code execution, data transmission, or sensitive data handling is present. The usage appears standard for configuration purposes. No suspicious or malicious activity or backdoors are evident. No obfuscation, malicious code, or secret leakage detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration snippet for setting API parameters using environment variables, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
