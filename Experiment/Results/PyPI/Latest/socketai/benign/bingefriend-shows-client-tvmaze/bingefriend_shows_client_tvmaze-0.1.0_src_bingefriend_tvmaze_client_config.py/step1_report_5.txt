  "purpose": "Configure environment-based parameters for the TVMaze API client.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: 'TVMAZE_API_BASE_URL', 'MAX_API_RETRIES', 'API_RETRY_BACKOFF_FACTOR'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is directly used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and converted to appropriate types (string, int, float).",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for configuration is normal; no suspicious or hardcoded secrets present. No code execution, data leaks, or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply reads configuration parameters from environment variables with default fallbacks, converting them to expected types. No dynamic code execution, data transmission, or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be standard configuration setup for an API client.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration snippet for API access, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
