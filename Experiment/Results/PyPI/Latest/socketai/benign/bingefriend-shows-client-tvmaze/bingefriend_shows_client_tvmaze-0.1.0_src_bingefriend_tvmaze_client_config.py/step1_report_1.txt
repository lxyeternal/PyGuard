  "purpose": "Configuration setup for the TVMaze API client, setting base URL and retry parameters.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: 'TVMAZE_API_BASE_URL', 'MAX_API_RETRIES', 'API_RETRY_BACKOFF_FACTOR'.",
  "sinks": "None directly; environment variables influence runtime behavior but do not process untrusted input in a dangerous way.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and converted to respective data types for configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code; no unusual code patterns or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os' and reads environment variables to configure API URL and retry parameters, converting them to appropriate numeric types. No untrusted or malicious data processing is evident. The default values are safe and standard for configuration. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code's structure is simple and straightforward, with no anomalies or obfuscated patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration snippet for an API client, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It safely reads environment variables for configuration parameters.",
