  "purpose": "Configuration for TVMaze API client using environment variables with default values.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: 'TVMAZE_API_BASE_URL', 'MAX_API_RETRIES', 'API_RETRY_BACKOFF_FACTOR'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed in a way that leads to vulnerabilities or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and converted to constants; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os', reads environment variables with defaults, converts them to appropriate types, and assigns to constants. It performs no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The use of environment variables for configuration is standard and safe. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's benign nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration snippet with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No improvements or changes are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
