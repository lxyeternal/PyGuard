  "purpose": "Configuration setup for TVMaze API client using environment variables with default values.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables 'TVMAZE_API_BASE_URL', 'MAX_API_RETRIES', 'API_RETRY_BACKOFF_FACTOR'.",
  "sinks": "None directly, as data is assigned to constants; potential indirect risk if environment variables are maliciously manipulated.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at startup and assigned to constants; no further data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables is standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. No obfuscation or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and retrieves configuration parameters from environment variables, providing default fallback values. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration setup, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The environment variable usage is typical for configurable API clients, and default values mitigate risks if environment variables are unset. There are no anomalies or signs of obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration snippet for an API client. It securely retrieves configuration from environment variables with safe defaults, and there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
