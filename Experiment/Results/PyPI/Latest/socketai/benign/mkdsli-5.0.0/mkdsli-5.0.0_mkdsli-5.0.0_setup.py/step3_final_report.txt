  "purpose": "Setup script that customizes the installation process by writing a file to /tmp/a during installation.",
  "sources": "Imports modules requests, socket, getpass, os; reads no external input.",
  "sinks": "Writes static string 'a' to /tmp/a during install; no other data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Execution flow: during install, run() writes 'a' to /tmp/a after standard installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unused imports (requests, socket, getpass, os); writing to /tmp/a during setup is unconventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with a custom install command that writes a static string to a temporary file. The unused imports suggest possible leftover or incomplete code but do not cause harm. The write operation is unusual in a setup context but not inherently malicious. No network activity, credential handling, or obfuscation is present. The suspicious elements are the file write and unused imports, which could be exploited if the package is compromised. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting low but notable concern due to the side effect.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with a minor unusual behavior (writing to /tmp/a during install). No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The low risk score is appropriate, but the side effect warrants monitoring in supply chain contexts.",
