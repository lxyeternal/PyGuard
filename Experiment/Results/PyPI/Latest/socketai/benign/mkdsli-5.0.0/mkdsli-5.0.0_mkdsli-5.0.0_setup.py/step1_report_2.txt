  "flows": "Installation process triggers custom run method, which writes to a file.",
  "anomalies": "Writing a file '/tmp/a' during installation without clear purpose; no obvious malicious intent, but unusual behavior in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools, defines a custom install class that extends the default. During installation, it writes a simple string 'a' to '/tmp/a'. The presence of requests, socket, getpass, os modules are unused in the provided code. The writing to '/tmp/a' is unusual but not inherently malicious; it could be a debug or placeholder action. There is no evidence of malicious network activity, credential theft, or malicious code injection. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic package setup with a custom install step that writes to a temporary file. There is no malicious intent detected, but the file-writing action is unusual in this context. Overall, it appears benign with no evident security risks.",
