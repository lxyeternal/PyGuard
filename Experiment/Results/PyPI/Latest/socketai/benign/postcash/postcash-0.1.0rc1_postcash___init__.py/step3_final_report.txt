{
  "purpose": "Minimal package initializer containing a descriptive docstring and version string, serving as a module metadata file.",
  "sources": "The module-level docstring and the version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static strings are assigned without processing or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple __init__.py file with a docstring and a version string. It contains no executable logic, data processing, network calls, or embedded code that could be malicious. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all justified as zero. The high confidence score is appropriate given the simplicity and static nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected, and the code aligns with typical package initialization files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are accurate and appropriate, indicating a safe and straightforward package initializer.",
  "confidence": 1,
