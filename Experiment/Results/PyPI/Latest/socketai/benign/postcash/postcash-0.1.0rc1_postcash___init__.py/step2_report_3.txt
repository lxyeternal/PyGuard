  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is minimal: a module-level docstring, a version string, and no executable code. There are no data flows, input/output operations, or external calls. This is typical for an `__init__.py` file meant for package metadata.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**  \nAll reports conclude that the code is benign, with no anomalies, obfuscated code, or malware indicators. This aligns with the code snippet, which contains only static strings and comments.\n\n3. **Assessment of Scores**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the lack of any malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0, which is reasonable because the code does not perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**  \n- The reports seem to assume that because the code is minimal and static, it cannot be malicious. This is a valid assumption here.  \n- There is no indication of embedded or hidden malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n5. **Consistency and Justification**  \n- The high confidence (1) in all reports is justified given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.  \n- No changes are necessary for the scores; they are consistent with the code content.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation & My Estimate**  \nGiven the data, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is a straightforward package initializer with no security issues or malware. Therefore, my estimates are:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Final conclusion:** The reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
