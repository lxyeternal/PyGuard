  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and compare them with the provided code snippet.\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe code is minimal, consisting solely of:\n- A module-level docstring describing asynchronous notification features.\n- A version string assignment.\n- No functions, imports, data processing, network calls, or executable logic.\n\n**Assessment of Each Report:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**  \n   - **Purpose:** Initialize package with version info and documentation.  \n   - **Findings:** No input/output, no data flows, no anomalies.  \n   - **Conclusion:** Benign, no malicious behavior.  \n   - **Score justification:** Correct; no issues detected.\n\n2. **Report 2:**  \n   - **Purpose:** Similar to above, documenting asynchronous notifications.  \n   - **Findings:** No data processing or external calls.  \n   - **Conclusion:** Benign.  \n   - **Score justification:** Appropriate; the code is purely metadata.\n\n3. **Report 3:**  \n   - **Purpose:** Initialization and documentation for the package.  \n   - **Findings:** No executable code, no data flows, no anomalies.  \n   - **Conclusion:** Benign.  \n   - **Score justification:** Correct; no security issues.\n\n4. **Report 4:**  \n   - **Purpose:** Package initialization with documentation.  \n   - **Findings:** Only a docstring and version string.  \n   - **Conclusion:** Benign.  \n   - **Score justification:** Appropriate.\n\n5. **Report 5:**  \n   - **Purpose:** Initialize package with version info and documentation.  \n   - **Findings:** No code that can process data or perform network operations.  \n   - **Conclusion:** Benign.  \n   - **Score justification:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Scores:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code snippet is purely declarative, with no executable logic, data processing, or network interactions.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns.\n- The documentation and version string do not pose any security risks.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No changes are necessary. The code is a safe, minimal package initializer with no security concerns.",
