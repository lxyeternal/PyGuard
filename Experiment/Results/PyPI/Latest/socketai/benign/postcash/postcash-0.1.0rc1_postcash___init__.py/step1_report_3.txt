  "purpose": "Initialization and documentation for the postcash package, indicating it handles asynchronous notifications via SMTP, Discord, and Telegram using FastAPI.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; no code reading input or data, only metadata and comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no execution of untrusted data or external calls in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified; the code is purely declarative with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of a docstring, version assignment, and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting only of a descriptive comment, a version string, and a docstring. There are no functions, imports, or executable code that could be malicious or suspicious. No input sources, data sinks, or flow paths are present. The simplicity suggests it's an initial module setup with no embedded malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module header with no suspicious or malicious content. It contains only documentation and version info, with no executable or data-handling code.",
