  "purpose": "The code calculates the distance between two geographic points and determines if a point is within a specified geofence radius.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: user_lat, user_lon, center_lat, center_lon, radius_meters; the map(radians, [...]) conversion.",
  "sinks": "The return statements providing distance and boolean result; no external data outputs or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are converted to radians, used in haversine_distance to compute the distance, then compared to radius in is_inside_geofence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs straightforward mathematical calculations without unusual logic or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard geographic calculations using the Haversine formula to determine distance. No external data reads, no network activity, no suspicious code patterns. Functions are well-documented and rely solely on mathematical operations. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated constructs. The logic is clear and standard for geospatial computations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of geofencing logic with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs straightforward calculations to check whether a point lies within a given radius. The overall security risk is minimal.",
