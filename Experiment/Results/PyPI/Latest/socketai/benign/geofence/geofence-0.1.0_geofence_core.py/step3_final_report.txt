  "purpose": "Utility functions to calculate geofence inclusion based on the Haversine distance between geographic coordinates.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: user_lat, user_lon, center_lat, center_lon, radius_meters; internal calculation via haversine_distance function.",
  "sinks": "Return value of is_inside_geofence indicating geofence status; no external data sinks or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input coordinates are processed through haversine_distance, which computes the distance; the result is compared to radius_meters to determine inclusion.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, well-documented, and uses standard formulas without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard geospatial distance calculation using the Haversine formula, with a simple check for geofence inclusion. No external data handling, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior are present. The functions are well-structured and serve a common purpose in location-based services. The code's benign nature is confirmed by multiple reviews, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential coordinate manipulation, but this is inherent to the utility’s purpose and not a security flaw.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of geofencing logic with no malicious or security concerns. Scores are consistent with its functionality; malware and obfuscation are absent, and security risk is negligible. Minor adjustments could set the security risk score to 0 for full accuracy.",
