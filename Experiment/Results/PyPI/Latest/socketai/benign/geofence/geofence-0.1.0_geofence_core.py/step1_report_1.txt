  "purpose": "Calculate geofence inclusion based on geographic coordinates using the Haversine formula.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: latitudes, longitudes, radius values.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through calculations in haversine_distance, then to is_inside_geofence for boundary checking.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code computes distance between two geographic points with the Haversine formula and checks if a point lies within a specified radius. It employs standard mathematical functions and straightforward logic, with no indication of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for geofencing purposes, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to be a benign utility for geospatial calculations.",
