  "purpose": "To calculate the distance between two geographic points and determine if a location is within a specified geofence radius.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: user_lat, user_lon, center_lat, center_lon, radius_meters; calculations within haversine_distance function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement in is_inside_geofence indicating whether the user is within the geofence.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed to compute distance in haversine_distance, then compared in is_inside_geofence to determine geofence inclusion.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious constructs observed. The code is straightforward and uses standard geographic calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard mathematical formulas for geographic distance calculation without any obfuscation or malicious constructs. It accepts coordinate inputs and performs a typical geofence check. No external data sources or untrusted data handling beyond input parameters are involved. The functions are well-documented and contain no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. Overall, the code appears benign and solely focused on geospatial computations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of geofence distance checking using the Haversine formula. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks. It is a benign utility function for geolocation validation.",
