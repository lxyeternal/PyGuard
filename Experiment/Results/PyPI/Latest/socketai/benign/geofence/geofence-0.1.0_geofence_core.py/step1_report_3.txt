{
  "purpose": "To calculate the distance between two geographic points and determine if a location is within a specified geofence radius.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: user_lat, user_lon, center_lat, center_lon, radius_meters; internally from the haversine_distance function.",
  "sinks": "Return value of is_inside_geofence function, which outputs a boolean indicating geofence status.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed to haversine_distance to compute distance, then compared to radius to determine inclusion within geofence.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no unusual dynamic execution or obfuscation; the code appears straightforward for geospatial calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard geospatial calculations using the Haversine formula, with proper use of mathematical functions and parameter handling. It uses no external data sources, no network or file I/O, and no manipulation of untrusted data beyond input parameters. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident. The functions are well-documented and serve a clear purpose without any suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of geofence logic with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs geographic distance calculations and checks inclusion within a radius, which is common in location-based services.",
