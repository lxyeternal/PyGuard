{
  "purpose": "Calculate geofence inclusion based on latitude and longitude coordinates using the Haversine formula.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: user_lat, user_lon, center_lat, center_lon, radius_meters; data flow occurs when calculating distance.",
  "sinks": "The distance calculation uses no untrusted data sinks that could leak information or execute harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) flow into the haversine_distance function, which computes distance; this flows into the comparison to radius_meters to determine boolean output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to calculate distances between geographical points using the Haversine formula and to check geofence inclusion. It uses standard mathematical functions and has no external or network interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The functions are solely computational, with no security issues or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic geospatial calculation without any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. It appears to be a benign utility for geofence checks.",
