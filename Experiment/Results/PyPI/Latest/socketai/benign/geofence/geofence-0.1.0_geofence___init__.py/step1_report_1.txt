{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions related to geofencing and distance calculations from a local module named 'core'.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement which loads functions from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or data handling in this code snippet; it only imports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are evident; the code is a simple import statement without any suspicious or unusual elements.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import of two functions, 'is_inside_geofence' and 'haversine_distance', from a relative module 'core'. There is no dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior. The imported functions suggest geolocation-related functionality, but nothing indicates malicious intent. The snippet is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a geospatial application or library.",
