{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions 'is_inside_geofence' and 'haversine_distance' from a local module 'core'. Their intended purpose appears to be geofence checks and distance calculations, likely related to location-based functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.core'. No input reading, data fetching, or user input is evident in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet. No data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or processing pathways shown, only import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are visible.",
  "analysis": "This fragment only shows import statements for functions related to geofencing and distance calculation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. Without further code, it cannot be determined if the imported functions are malicious, but the import itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement importing geofence and distance functions from a local module. No malicious behavior, security issues, or suspicious activity are evident in this snippet.",
