  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code activities observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of functions from a local module. There are no external data sources, user inputs, or untrusted data involved. The imported functions themselves could contain malicious behavior, but that cannot be assessed from this single import statement. The code structure is standard and lacks any obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no immediate signs of malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or malicious activities are detected in this code snippet.",
