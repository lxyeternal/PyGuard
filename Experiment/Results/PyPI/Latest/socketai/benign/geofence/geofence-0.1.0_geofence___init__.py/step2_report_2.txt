  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their validity, scores, and any inconsistencies.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code snippet: a straightforward import statement from a local module 'core'.\n- None of the reports identify any actual malicious activity, anomalies, or suspicious behavior in the code itself.\n- The functions imported are named in a way that suggests geospatial functionality, which is common and benign.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is a simple import statement; no issues are present.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None. The logic is sound, and the reasoning in the reports is consistent.\n- **Scores:** The scores for malware and security risk are all zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None are claimed or implied; the reports correctly avoid assumptions.\n- **Consistency:** The scores align with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n- The high confidence scores are justified given the simplicity.\n- The malware scores are correctly set to zero, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- The obfuscated score is zero, consistent with the code being straightforward and unobfuscated.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the current scores and conclusions. The code snippet is benign, and the reports' reasoning is sound.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is a standard import statement with no security concerns.",
