  "purpose": "Import functions 'is_inside_geofence' and 'haversine_distance' from the local 'core' module, likely for geospatial computations.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local 'core' module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible due to absence of operational code, only imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains import statements; no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple import statement importing two functions from a relative module. No input reading, data handling, or execution of code is present. Without additional code, no security concerns or malicious behaviors are evident. The imported functions' implementation might contain issues, but cannot be assessed from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It is part of a larger program likely involving geospatial calculations. No malware or anomalies detected in this fragment.",
