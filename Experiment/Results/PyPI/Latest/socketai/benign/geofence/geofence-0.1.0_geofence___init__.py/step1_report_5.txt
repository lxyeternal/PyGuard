  "purpose": "Import functions is_inside_geofence and haversine_distance from the local core module, likely for geospatial computations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a local module (.core). No external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident from this single import statement alone.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, just an import statement. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures are apparent.",
  "analysis": "This code only imports two functions from a local module, which is standard practice in Python projects. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The functions’ names suggest geospatial calculations, which are typical for location-based services.",
  "conclusion": "There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this import statement. The code appears benign.",
