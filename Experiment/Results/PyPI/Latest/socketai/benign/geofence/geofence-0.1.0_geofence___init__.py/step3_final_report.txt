{
  "purpose": "The code imports two functions related to geofencing and distance calculations from a local module, likely for location-based processing.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.core' for functions 'is_inside_geofence' and 'haversine_distance'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this snippet; it only imports functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this snippet; it merely imports functions for potential use elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with no executable logic, data handling, or external inputs. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, anomalies, or security risks. The functions imported are named in a typical manner for geospatial computations, and the code is not obfuscated. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the snippet. Without additional context or implementation details of the imported functions, no further risks can be inferred. The high confidence scores reflect certainty in benignity, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports' assessments and scores are appropriate and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
