  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script with no malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Author name, author_email, url, description, long_description, classifiers",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or network operations",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration data only",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author_email ('hitler@gmail.com') and url ('https://thugging.org') as metadata concerns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic or obfuscated code. The only notable signals are unprofessional contact info and URL, which could be used for social engineering but do not constitute malicious behavior. Malware score is correctly 0; obfuscation is absent (0). The security risk varies based on metadata suspicion but should be low, around 0.2, reflecting social engineering concerns rather than technical vulnerabilities. Confidence in the benign nature of code is high (near 1).",
  "conclusion": "The package is technically benign with no malicious code or obfuscation. The main concern is metadata (suspicious contact info and URL), which does not pose a direct security threat but warrants caution. The appropriate scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.2.",
