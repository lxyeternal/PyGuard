  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python library named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters such as name, version, author, email, description, URL, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no user input or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual author email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org') which could indicate malicious intent or inappropriate content, but these are not technically malicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup configuration using setuptools for packaging a Python library. There is no dynamic code, no input handling, and no execution of untrusted data. The only noteworthy aspect is the author’s email and URL, which are suspicious but do not constitute malicious code or malware. The description states it's an obfuscation test library, but the code itself is straightforward and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, legitimate setup script with no malicious behavior or malware present. The only concern is the suspicious author email and URL, which may be a social engineering or placeholder concern, but from a security perspective, there is no threat.",
