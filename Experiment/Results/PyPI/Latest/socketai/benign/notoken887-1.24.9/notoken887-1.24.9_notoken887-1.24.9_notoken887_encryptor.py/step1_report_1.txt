{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple substitution encryption and decryption of strings using emojis as tokens.",
  "sources": "The input data is taken as the 'string' parameter for encrypt and 'encrypted_token' parameter for decrypt.",
  "sinks": "The functions only perform string replacements within the code; no external data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input string flows into 'encrypt' or 'decrypt' methods, which perform direct string replacements; no data leaves the process or interacts with external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely performs static string substitutions without any dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident. No external network communication, system modification, or data exfiltration is present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward substitution cipher using emoji characters for alphabetic and numeric characters, with explicit mappings. The 'encrypt' method replaces characters with emojis, and 'decrypt' reverses the process. There are no input sanitization, external data access, or system commands. No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hidden functions, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to serve as a simple encoding/decoding utility, likely intended for obscuring data visually but not securely. It does not perform any malicious activity or security-critical operations.",
  "conclusion": "The class implements a basic emoji substitution cipher without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is a benign utility for encoding and decoding strings. There are no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious side-effects.",
