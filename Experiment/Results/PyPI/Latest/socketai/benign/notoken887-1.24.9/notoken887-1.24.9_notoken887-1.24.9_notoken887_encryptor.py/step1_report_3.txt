{
  "purpose": "This class provides a simple reversible substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings using emoji replacements.",
  "sources": "The encrypt method reads the input string; the decrypt method reads the encrypted token.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or system effects; no external data or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input string is processed through chained replace calls in encrypt; encrypted data is processed similarly in decrypt to revert changes.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely performs character substitution with emojis; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a straightforward substitution cipher, replacing each alphanumeric character and period with a corresponding emoji, and vice versa. The replace chains are deterministic and do not involve any external data, network activity, or system modifications. No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are present. The code does not perform any sensitive operations or have side effects beyond string transformations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, simple encoding/decoding utility using emoji substitutions. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
