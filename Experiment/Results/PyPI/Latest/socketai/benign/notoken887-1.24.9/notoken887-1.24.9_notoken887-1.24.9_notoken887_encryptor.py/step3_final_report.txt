  "purpose": "A simple reversible substitution cipher encoding alphanumeric characters and period with emojis.",
  "sources": "In-memory string replacements within encrypt and decrypt functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network, or system interactions; purely in-memory transformations.",
  "flows": "Input string -> substitution replacements -> output string; reverse in decrypt.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation beyond static replacements; no secrets, no dynamic code, no malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static, deterministic character substitutions with emojis for alphanumeric characters and period. It contains no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation techniques. Both encrypt and decrypt functions are straightforward, with explicit mappings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The implementation is a benign utility for encoding or visual obfuscation, not security purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static emoji substitution cipher with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any external communication or system modification. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, reflecting its harmless nature.",
