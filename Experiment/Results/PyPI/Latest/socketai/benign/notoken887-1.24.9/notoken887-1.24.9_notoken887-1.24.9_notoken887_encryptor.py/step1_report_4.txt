{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods to encode and decode strings by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa, essentially a simple character substitution cipher.",
  "sources": "The 'encrypt' method reads the input string; the 'decrypt' method reads the encrypted token.",
  "sinks": "The methods perform replacements on strings, but do not write to external systems or data stores. No direct sinks such as network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input string flows into 'encrypt', where characters are replaced with emojis; the output can be decrypted back to the original string through 'decrypt'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior is observed. The replacement mappings are extensive but straightforward; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs character substitution for encryption/decryption using predefined mappings. The 'encrypt' method replaces characters with emojis; 'decrypt' reverses this process. There are no external inputs, outputs, or system calls. The methods are simple string replacements, which do not introduce security vulnerabilities. No hardcoded secrets, no code injection, and no suspicious network or system activity are present. The implementation is transparent, with explicit character mappings, and does not exhibit signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious character substitution cipher for string encoding and decoding. It poses no security risks or malicious threats based on its content and structure.",
