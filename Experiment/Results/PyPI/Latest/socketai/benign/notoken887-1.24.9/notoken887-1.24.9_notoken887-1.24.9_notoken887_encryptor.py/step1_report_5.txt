{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple character-based substitution encryption and decryption for strings using emojis and symbols.",
  "sources": "The input data is the string passed to the encrypt method; encrypted tokens are the output from encrypt, and the decrypt method takes these encrypted tokens as input.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks that handle untrusted input; the methods return processed strings. There are no network, file, or environment variable operations.",
  "flows": "Input string → encrypt method (replacements) → encrypted string; encrypted string → decrypt method (replacements) → original string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The code performs straightforward character replacements without dynamic code execution or external dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The class implements simple, static character replacement substitution cipher, converting alphanumeric characters and period into emojis and symbols for obfuscation, and vice versa. There are no external data sources, network connections, or secret handling. The logic is straightforward, with a one-to-one mapping implemented through chained replace() calls. It appears purely for obfuscation or encoding purposes. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection are present. The functions are symmetric and do not execute external code or access sensitive system resources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic substitution cipher for string obfuscation using emojis. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It performs no network or system operations and has no hidden functionalities. It appears to be intended for encoding/decoding display strings or simple obfuscation.",
