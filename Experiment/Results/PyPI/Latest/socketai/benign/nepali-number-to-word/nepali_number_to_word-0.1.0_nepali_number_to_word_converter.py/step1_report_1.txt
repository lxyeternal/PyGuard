{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to convert numbers into Nepali words and numerals, supporting localization and formatting features.",
  "sources": "Input is taken via method arguments: 'number' parameters in 'convert_to_nepali_words' and 'convert_to_nepali_numerals'.",
  "sinks": "Results are returned as strings; no external data is written, transmitted, or stored within the code.",
  "flows": "Input number flows through validation, then into conversion functions, generating formatted Nepali words or numerals, with no external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs observed. Code structure and logic follow standard number-to-word conversion patterns. Constants and data structures appear to be legitimate. No obfuscated code, hidden network calls, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The module primarily handles number conversion and formatting. It validates input ranges, converts numbers into Nepali words or numerals, and formats strings with Nepali-style commas. The methods operate purely on internal data and provided inputs. No external data sources, network calls, or sensitive information handling are present. The constants and methods seem appropriate for their intended purpose. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code, are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward number localization utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate number conversion utility for Nepali numerals and words. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on the analysis. It functions solely to format and convert numbers within supported ranges. No indicators of malware or malicious intent are detected.",
