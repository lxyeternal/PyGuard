{
  "purpose": "Convert numerical values to Nepali words and numerals for display and formatting purposes.",
  "sources": "Constants imported from '.constants' module; class methods accepting 'number' as input; internal validation functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or eval functions; purely computational with string output.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' is validated, processed through multiple conversion functions, and output as formatted string or Nepali words.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. The code strictly performs number-to-word and numeral conversion. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior detected. No malicious data leaks or system interactions observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs number validation, conversion to Nepali words, and numeral formatting. It uses class and static methods appropriately with clear validation and conversion logic. No external system calls, network activity, or file operations are present. The constants imported are likely predefined data structures for number-word mappings. The code is well-structured, and no anomalies or suspicious logic are detected. No signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, remote commands, or system compromise mechanisms. The functions strictly handle number formatting and language conversion, with no hidden code or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured number-to-Nepali converter without any malicious features. It appears safe and does not contain malware or suspicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal.",
