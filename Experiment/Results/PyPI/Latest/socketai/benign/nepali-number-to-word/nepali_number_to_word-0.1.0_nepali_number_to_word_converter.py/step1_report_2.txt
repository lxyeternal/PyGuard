  "purpose": "Convert numerical values to Nepali words and numerals, supporting large numbers and proper formatting.",
  "sources": "Input number parameter in convert_to_nepali_words and convert_to_nepali_numerals methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs; output is derived from trusted input parameters after processing.",
  "flows": "Input number -> validation -> conversion logic -> output string; no external data flows or untrusted external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No network calls, file operations, or obfuscated code. Conversion logic is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides number-to-word and number-to-numeral conversions in Nepali. It uses class and static methods for processing, with proper range validation and formatting functions. The input data is numerical, with validation to prevent exceeding maximum supported values. The methods do not perform any network operations, file I/O, or external system modifications. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. The structure is clear, and there are no unusual or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured number conversion utility without malicious intent. There are no security risks or malicious behaviors evident. It functions solely to convert numbers to Nepali language formats, with no external communications or secret backdoors.",
