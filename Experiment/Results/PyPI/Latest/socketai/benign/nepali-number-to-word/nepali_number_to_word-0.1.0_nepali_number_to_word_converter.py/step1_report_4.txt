  "purpose": "The code provides functionality to convert numerical values into Nepali words and numerals, primarily for display or formatting purposes within applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads the input 'number' parameter in methods 'convert_to_nepali_words' and 'convert_to_nepali_numerals'.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the return of formatted Nepali words or numerals. No external data sinks or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' is validated, then processed through internal conversion functions to produce Nepali words or numerals, with no external side effects or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. The code uses static data structures and standard Python features. No obfuscated code or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward number-to-text and number-to-numerals conversion in Nepali. It validates input range, handles negative numbers, and formats output with Nepali-specific commas. The constants and methods are typical for number conversion tasks. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code appears well-structured, with no unusual or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard number conversion utility with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It safely converts numbers to Nepali words and numerals, following proper validation and formatting practices. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage.",
