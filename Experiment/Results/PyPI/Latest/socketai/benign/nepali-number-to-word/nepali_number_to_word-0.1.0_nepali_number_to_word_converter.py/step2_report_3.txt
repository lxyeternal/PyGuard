  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of number-to-Nepali words and numerals conversion. It uses constants, validation, and formatting functions. No anomalies, external data access, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**:  \n   The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. They correctly identify that the code is a utility for number localization and formatting, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent in these assessments.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign malware scores of 0.0, obfuscated scores of 0.0, and security risks of 0.0, which are reasonable given the code's nature. The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), reflecting the reviewers' certainty.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely for number conversion, with no external interactions, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution, there is no justification for a high risk score. The maximum risk score should remain at 0.0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware scores are all 0.0, consistent with the code's functionality. No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports base their conclusions on observable code behavior, constants, and logic. They do not rely on assumptions about hidden behaviors.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0.0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0.0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0.0** — No security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- The code is a standard number-to-word and numeral converter for Nepali, with proper validation and formatting.\n- No external dependencies, network calls, or data leaks are present.\n- The constants and methods are used appropriately.\n- The code is not obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nBased on the detailed review, the code is a legitimate, safe utility for Nepali number conversion with no security concerns. The current scoring accurately reflects this assessment.",
