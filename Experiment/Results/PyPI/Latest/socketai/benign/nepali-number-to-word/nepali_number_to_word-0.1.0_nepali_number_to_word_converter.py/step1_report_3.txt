{
  "purpose": "Convert numerical values to Nepali words and numerals, supporting large numbers and proper formatting.",
  "sources": "Imports constants from .constants module; class methods and static methods process input parameters; no external data sources are accessed.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code does not write data to external systems, networks, or files.",
  "flows": "Input number passed to convert_to_nepali_words or convert_to_nepali_numerals → validation → conversion → output string",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The code follows standard conversion logic. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides number-to-text and number-to-numerals conversion for Nepali language, supporting large number scales and formatted output. Validation ensures numbers are within supported range, preventing overflow or excessively large inputs. The use of class constants and methods appears standard. No external network calls, no data exfiltration mechanisms, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. The functions perform straightforward conversions based on provided constants, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs number conversions for Nepali numerals and words without any evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, validates inputs, and does not include harmful operations.",
