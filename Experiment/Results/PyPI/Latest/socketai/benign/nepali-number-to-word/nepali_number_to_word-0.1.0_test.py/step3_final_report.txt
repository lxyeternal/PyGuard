{
  "purpose": "The code imports a third-party Nepali number conversion library, creates a converter object, and calls conversion methods with a static number 3, then prints the results.",
  "sources": "Import statement for nepali_number_to_word; instantiation of NepaliNumberConverter; method calls convert_to_nepali_words and convert_to_nepali_numerals with hardcoded input 3.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting conversion results; no untrusted data sources or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "Static input (number 3) flows from method calls to print outputs; no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected; reliance on external library without verification noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing simple number conversions using a third-party library. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. The only potential concern is the trustworthiness of the external dependency, but this does not constitute malicious behavior. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and security risk at 0 or 0.1 due to dependency trust. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only minor concern relates to the external library's trustworthiness, which does not warrant a higher malware or security risk score. The current assessment scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
