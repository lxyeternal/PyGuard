{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to convert numbers to Nepali words and numerals using the NepaliNumberConverter library.",
  "sources": "The code imports a function/class from the 'nepali_number_to_word' module and uses its methods to perform conversions.",
  "sinks": "The code executes conversion methods and prints their output; no sinks directly handle untrusted data or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Input number '3' is passed to conversion functions, and the output is printed; data flows from hardcoded input to conversion functions and then to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code present. The library import is standard, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific library for Nepali number conversion, creates a converter object, and calls two methods with a static number. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or obfuscated code. The usage appears straightforward and limited to number conversion tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign usage of a number conversion library with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
