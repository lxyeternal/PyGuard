  "flows": "N/A; simple function calls without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected; code uses a standard library for specific conversion tasks",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module nepali_number_to_word and creates an instance of NepaliNumberConverter. It then performs two method calls to convert the number 3 to Nepali words and numerals. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious network activity. The library used appears to be a standard conversion utility. The code is straightforward and does not exhibit malicious intent or unusual behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic number conversions using a third-party library with no indications of malicious activity or security risks.",
