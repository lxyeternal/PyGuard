{
  "purpose": "To convert numbers to Nepali words and numerals using the 'nepali_number_to_word' library.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'NepaliNumberConverter' from 'nepali_number_to_word'; instantiation of the converter object; method calls 'convert_to_nepali_words' and 'convert_to_nepali_numerals' with input 3.",
  "sinks": "Method calls on the 'converter' object, which internally may process or handle data but no explicit sinks such as network, file I/O, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Input value 3 flows into the conversion methods; outputs are printed, but no data leaves the system in an untrusted context; no data leakage or external communication detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated code present. Usage of third-party library appears standard. No unusual or unexpected behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific conversion class from an external package and uses it for straightforward number conversion tasks. There are no dynamic code executions, external data retrieval, or malicious patterns. The library functions are called with a static value, and outputs are printed locally. The code structure is simple, clear, and does not exhibit signs of malicious intent or malicious obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign usage of a third-party library for number conversion without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.",
