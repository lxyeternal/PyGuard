{
  "purpose": "The code imports a class to convert numbers to Nepali words and numerals, then performs conversions on the number 3.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'NepaliNumberConverter' from 'nepali_number_to_word'; usage of 'converter.convert_to_nepali_words' and 'converter.convert_to_nepali_numerals' methods.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting conversion results; no external data sinks or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input number 3 flows from the conversion method calls to the print output; no external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior; use of a presumably legitimate external library without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a library and calls two methods on a fixed input (3), then prints the results. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The imported module's integrity cannot be guaranteed solely from this code, but the code itself does not contain malicious logic or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward use of a third-party library for number conversion with no malicious intent or security risks detected within this fragment.",
