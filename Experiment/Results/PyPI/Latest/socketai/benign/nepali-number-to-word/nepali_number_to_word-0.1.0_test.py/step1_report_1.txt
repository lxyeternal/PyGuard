{
  "purpose": "The code uses a third-party module 'nepali_number_to_word' to convert numbers to Nepali words and numerals.",
  "sources": "The code imports a module and calls its methods; no user input or external data sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet that could lead to data leaks or system effects; output is simply printed.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows are apparent; method calls are made with constant literals, and no data from external sources is processed.",
  "anomalies": "The module 'nepali_number_to_word' is imported without any verification of its source or integrity; no suspicious code is evident in this fragment itself.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a presumably third-party library intended for Nepali number conversions. It then creates an instance of the converter class and calls two methods with a hardcoded number. The code does not process external input, nor does it perform network operations, file I/O, or execute any dynamic code. There are no obvious signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration within this snippet. However, because the functionality depends on an external module, its security integrity cannot be assessed from this fragment alone. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to perform a straightforward, benign operation utilizing an external library for number conversion tasks.",
