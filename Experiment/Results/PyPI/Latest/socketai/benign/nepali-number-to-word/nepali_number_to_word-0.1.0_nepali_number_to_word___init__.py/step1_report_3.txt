{
  "purpose": "The code provides a package for converting numbers to Nepali words, mainly defining the module's metadata and importing a converter class.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'NepaliNumberConverter' class from a local module named 'converter'.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "The code does not process any data; it only sets up module metadata and imports a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a docstring describing its purpose, an import statement, and module-level metadata (__version__, __all__). There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows that could lead to security issues. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. Since it only imports a class and defines metadata, the risk of malicious activity is extremely low.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports a class and sets metadata, with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity.",
