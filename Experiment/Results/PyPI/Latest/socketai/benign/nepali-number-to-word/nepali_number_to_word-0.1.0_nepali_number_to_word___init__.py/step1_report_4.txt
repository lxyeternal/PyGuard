  "purpose": "Expose and facilitate conversion of numbers to Nepali words",
  "sources": "Import statement importing NepaliNumberConverter from a local module",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data processing or output in this fragment",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks within this code snippet",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected; minimal code, no dynamic execution or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of a module docstring, import statement, version declaration, and export list. There are no functions, input handling, data processing, or network activities. The import is from a local module, which appears standard and benign. No malicious patterns such as data leaks, network communication, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module declaration for a number-to-word converter with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It appears safe and straightforward.",
