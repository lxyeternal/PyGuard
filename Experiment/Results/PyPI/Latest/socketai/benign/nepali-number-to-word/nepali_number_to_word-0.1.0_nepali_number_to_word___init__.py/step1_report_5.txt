  "purpose": "The code provides a module for converting numbers to Nepali words by exposing the NepaliNumberConverter class.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only imports a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only sets module attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and minimal, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local converter module, defines versioning and export variables, and provides a descriptive comment. No user input, network calls, or dynamic code execution is present. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. The simplicity and lack of external data handling suggest a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured module definition for a Nepali number-to-word converter, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
