{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for the NepaliNumberConverter class, verifying conversion to Nepali words and numerals with predefined test cases.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded input numbers within test cases",
  "sinks": "Assertions comparing output strings; no external data or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "Input numbers flow into converter methods, which produce output strings checked against expected values",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward test functions with static inputs and assertions, with no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and a security risk score of 0. The negative number test case outputs an appropriate Nepali term for negative, but no malicious intent is evident. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test suite for a number conversion library, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
