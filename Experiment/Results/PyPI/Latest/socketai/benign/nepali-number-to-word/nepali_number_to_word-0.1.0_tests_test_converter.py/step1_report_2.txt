{
  "purpose": "The code provides test cases for the NepaliNumberConverter class, verifying its conversion methods for Nepali words and numerals.",
  "sources": "The code reads test input values defined in the test_cases lists within two test functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not output untrusted data externally or perform any network, file, or environment operations.",
  "flows": "Test inputs are fed into the convert_to_nepali_words and convert_to_nepali_numerals methods; the expected outputs are compared via assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code structure is straightforward, containing standard test case patterns with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a converter class and defines test functions to verify conversion outputs against expected Nepali representations. The code appears to be standard test code, with no signs of obfuscated logic, malicious data handling, or network activity. It solely performs assertions on a presumed external library, without any malicious or suspicious code segments. No input or output outside the test context is involved, and there are no anomalies or indicators of sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical test suite for the NepaliNumberConverter class, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It merely tests conversion functionalities as intended, with no suspicious activity or malicious intent detected.",
