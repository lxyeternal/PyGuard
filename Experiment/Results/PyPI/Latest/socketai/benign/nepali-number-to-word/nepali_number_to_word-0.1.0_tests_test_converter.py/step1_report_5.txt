  "purpose": "Test suite for Nepali number conversion functions in the nepali_number_to_word.converter module",
  "sources": "Imports from nepali_number_to_word.converter; test case definitions; input values in test cases",
  "sinks": "Assertions that compare conversion outputs to expected strings",
  "flows": "Input numbers from test cases flow into converter.convert_to_nepali_words and convert_to_nepali_numerals methods, then compare to expected outputs",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; code appears to be standard test functions without obfuscated or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific converter class and runs multiple assertions on its methods with various numerical inputs. No external data sources, network operations, or security-sensitive actions are present. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors detected, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code solely performs unit tests, which are standard and benign in nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite for Nepali number conversion functions. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible, with high confidence in this assessment.",
