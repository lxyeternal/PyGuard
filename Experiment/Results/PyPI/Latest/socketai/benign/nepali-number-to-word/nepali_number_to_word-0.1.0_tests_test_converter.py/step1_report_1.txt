  "purpose": "Test cases for Nepali number converter module, verifying conversion to words and numerals.",
  "sources": "Imports from nepali_number_to_word.converter, test case data inputs for numbers.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or exposed; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Conversion functions are called with test inputs, but do not process untrusted user input or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward test code without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite for a Nepali number converter module, with predefined test cases for converting numbers to Nepali words and numerals. It imports a specific converter class and verifies its output against expected strings. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or data leaks. The code performs basic assertions without involving external untrusted data sources or sensitive operations. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are observed. Overall, the code appears purely functional and for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard test code for a converter module, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
