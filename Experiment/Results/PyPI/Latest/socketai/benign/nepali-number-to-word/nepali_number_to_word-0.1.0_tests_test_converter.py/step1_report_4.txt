{
  "purpose": "The code provides test cases for the NepaliNumberConverter class, verifying its functions convert_to_nepali_words and convert_to_nepali_numerals.",
  "sources": "The code imports NepaliNumberConverter from nepali_number_to_word.converter and reads test input data (numbers) from within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "The code calls methods on the converter object, which may process input data but does not explicitly output untrusted data outside the test context.",
  "flows": "Input data (numbers) flow into the convert_to_nepali_words and convert_to_nepali_numerals methods; the results are compared with expected outputs, indicating data flow is confined within testing assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward test logic.",
  "analysis": "The script is a set of test functions for verifying the correctness of the NepaliNumberConverter class methods. It imports a class from an external module and executes multiple assertions. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or file manipulation is present. The code appears to be standard test code, with no signs of obfuscated code or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for testing a Nepali number conversion library. There are no indicators of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks. It functions as intended for testing purposes.",
