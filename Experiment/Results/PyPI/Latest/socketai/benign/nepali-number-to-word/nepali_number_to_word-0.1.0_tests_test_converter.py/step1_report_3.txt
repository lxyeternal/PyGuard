{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test the functionality of the NepaliNumberConverter class by verifying its output for various numerical inputs, both in words and numerals.",
  "sources": "The code reads input numbers from hardcoded test cases within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted or external data are present. The code does not perform network I/O, file access, or system commands.",
  "flows": "The data flow involves input numbers from the test_cases list being passed to the converter methods, then their output being checked against expected strings.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a hardcoded negative number test case with the output 'ऋणात्मक...', which is contextually appropriate. No suspicious or unusual code structures, such as dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of test functions that instantiate the NepaliNumberConverter class and verify its methods against predefined cases. There are no indications of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code does not manipulate environment variables, perform unsafe SQL, or execute external commands. All data inputs are controlled and predefined within the test cases. The structure and format are typical for unit testing scripts, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward test script for verifying the correctness of a number conversion class. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior, and no suspicious or anomalous code elements are present.",
