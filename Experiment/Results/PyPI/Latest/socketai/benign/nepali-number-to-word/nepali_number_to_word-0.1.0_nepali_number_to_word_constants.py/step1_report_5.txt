  "purpose": "Define Nepali number words, numerals, and special number names for converting or representing numbers in Nepali language.",
  "sources": "Constants and lists defining number words and special cases; dictionary mapping digits to Nepali numerals.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths since the code only defines constants and a dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic execution, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static data definitions: lists for units, tens, hundreds, large scale numbers, special numbers, and a dictionary for digit-to-character mappings. There are no functions, input handling, or runtime behaviors that could introduce security risks. The data appears to be for linguistic or numerical conversion purposes, with no embedded malicious logic or external data access.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward collection of static data used for Nepali number conversion or representation. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe and purely informational.",
