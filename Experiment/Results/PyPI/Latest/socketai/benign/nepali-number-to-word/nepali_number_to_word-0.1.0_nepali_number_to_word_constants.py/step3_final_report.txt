{
  "purpose": "Static data definitions for Nepali number words and numerals, serving as resources for number conversion or language processing.",
  "sources": "Lists of units, tens, hundreds, large denominations, special numbers, and a dictionary mapping digits to Nepali numerals.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or input/output operations; static data only.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or dynamic processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; code is straightforward static data.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises static lists and a dictionary with Nepali number words and numerals. No functions, input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The data appears intended for number translation or language processing. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are identified. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. The assessments are accurate and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static resource module for Nepali number words and numerals. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The existing reports and scores are appropriate and accurate.",
