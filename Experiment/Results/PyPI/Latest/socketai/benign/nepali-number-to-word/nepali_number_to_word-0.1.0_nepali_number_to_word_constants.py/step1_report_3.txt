{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define Nepali number words, numerals, and related constants for converting numbers to Nepali words.",
  "sources": "The code contains predefined lists and a dictionary for number words and numerals, but no data input reading mechanisms are present.",
  "sinks": "No functions, data output, or external data handling mechanisms are present; hence, no sinks are identified.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from sources to sinks; the code only defines static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward data definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of static data structures representing Nepali number words and numerals. There are no functions, no input/output operations, no network connections, or other dynamic behaviors. All lists and dictionaries are hardcoded with language-specific data, and there is no indication of malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static data module providing Nepali number words and numerals. It poses no security risks, malware, or malicious behavior. It appears intended for number conversion or language processing purposes only.",
