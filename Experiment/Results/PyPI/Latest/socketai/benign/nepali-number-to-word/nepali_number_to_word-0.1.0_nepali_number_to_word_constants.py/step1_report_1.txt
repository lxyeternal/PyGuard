  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or processing logic is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected. The code consists solely of static data definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely declares constant lists and a dictionary for Nepali number words and numerals. There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. It appears to serve as a resource or reference for number translation. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or backdoors are present. No hardcoded secrets or insecure patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static resource module providing Nepali number words and numerals without any malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be safe for use as part of a larger application.",
