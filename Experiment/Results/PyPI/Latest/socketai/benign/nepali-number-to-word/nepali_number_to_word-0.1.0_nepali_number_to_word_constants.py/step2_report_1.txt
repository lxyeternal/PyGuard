  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Summary:**\n   - The code consists solely of static data structures: lists for units, tens, hundreds, large denominations, special numbers, and a dictionary mapping digits to Nepali numerals.\n   - No functions, input/output operations, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - The data appears to serve as a resource for number conversion or language processing related to Nepali numerals and words.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues or Malicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is static data with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or suspicious constructs.\n   - No anomalies, such as hidden code, code injection, or backdoors, are detected.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the static nature and lack of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable data declarations.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security vulnerabilities or risky patterns.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores:**\n   - The scores seem reasonable and consistent across all reports. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static data with no malicious or risky behavior.\n   - No claims are based on unfounded assumptions; the analysis is consistent with the code content.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a benign, static resource module for Nepali number words and numerals.\n   - No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, and the reports are accurate in their assessments.**",
