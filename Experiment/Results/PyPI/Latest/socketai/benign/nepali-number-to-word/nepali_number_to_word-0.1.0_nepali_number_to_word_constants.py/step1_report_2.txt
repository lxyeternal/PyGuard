  "purpose": "Define Nepali number words, numerals, and constants for number conversion.",
  "sources": "Constant list and dictionary definitions at the beginning of the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output mechanisms.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing logic; only data definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard data declarations with no unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static data structures: lists for units, tens, hundreds, large number denominations, special numbers, and a dictionary for digit-to-Nepali numeral mapping. There are no functions, input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The data appears to be for converting or representing numbers in Nepali language. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data definition module used for Nepali number representation. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
