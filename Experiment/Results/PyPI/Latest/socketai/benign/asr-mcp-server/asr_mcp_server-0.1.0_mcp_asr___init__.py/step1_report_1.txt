{
  "purpose": "The code exports two functions, 'submit_asr_task' and 'query_asr_task', from the 'asr_api' module, likely for handling automatic speech recognition tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'asr_api' module, which may fetch external or internal API functions.",
  "sinks": "Exports of functions which could be used elsewhere; no direct sinks for untrusted data within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imported functions are assigned to '__all__', making them available for import elsewhere; no data flow from untrusted sources is visible in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no suspicious or unusual patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements. No malicious activity is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific functions from a module and exposes them via the '__all__' list. There are no data processing, user input handling, or network operations. This minimal pattern is typical for module exports and contains no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward module export statement, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is likely part of a larger codebase where these functions are used securely.",
