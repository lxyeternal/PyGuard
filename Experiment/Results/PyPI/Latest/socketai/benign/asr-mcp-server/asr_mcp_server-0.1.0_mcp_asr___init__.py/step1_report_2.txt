{
  "purpose": "The code exports functions 'submit_asr_task' and 'query_asr_task' from the 'asr_api' module, likely for external use in submitting and querying automatic speech recognition tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports 'submit_asr_task' and 'query_asr_task' from 'asr_api' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurs within this snippet; it only imports and exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no unusual constructs or hardcoded secrets. The use of '__all__' for exports is standard. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports two functions from an API module and defines the module's exports. There are no data handling, user inputs, or network operations shown. It does not contain any signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data leakage. The minimal code indicates it is a standard module interface.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic module re-export of API functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign and standard for Python modules.",
