  "purpose": "Exports functions 'submit_asr_task' and 'query_asr_task' from the 'asr_api' module, likely for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports 'submit_asr_task' and 'query_asr_task' from 'asr_api'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or insecure data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imports are exported via __all__, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is visible.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from a module and exposes them via __all__, indicating intended API exposure. No input processing, no data leaks, no obfuscated or malicious code features are present. The code is minimal, straightforward, and appears to serve as an API interface setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simply exporting functions for external use. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
