  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code simply imports two functions (`submit_asr_task` and `query_asr_task`) from the `asr_api` module and exposes them via the `__all__` list. There are no signs of data processing, user input handling, network activity, or any other logic within this snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:  \n   The reports uniformly identify the code as straightforward, minimal, and standard for module exports. No logical errors or security flaws are evident in this isolated snippet.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, indicating no malicious activity detected or suspected.  \n   - **Security Risk Score**: Mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1, which seems slightly elevated but still very low. Given the code's simplicity, a risk score higher than 0.1 isn't justified unless there are external factors not visible here.\n\n4. **Assessment of Malware and Security Risks**:  \n   - Since the code only re-exports functions, there's no evidence of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.  \n   - The presence of the functions themselves in the `asr_api` module could be a concern if that module contains malicious code, but based solely on this snippet, there's no indication of such.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   - No claims in the reports are based on assumptions; all recognize the code as benign and standard.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis. The only outlier is the 0.1 security risk score in report 5, which might be slightly overestimating given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — minimal risk, as the code only exports functions without any logic or data handling.\n\n### Overall Estimate:\n\nGiven the complete analysis, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware**: **0**  \n- **Obfuscated**: **0**  \n- **Risk**: **0**  \n\nThis aligns with the evidence: the code is a simple module export pattern with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
