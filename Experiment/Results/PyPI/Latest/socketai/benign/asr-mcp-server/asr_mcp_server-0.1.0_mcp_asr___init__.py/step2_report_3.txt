  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code only imports two functions from `asr_api` and exposes them via `__all__`.\n   - There are no data flows, no input handling, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation.\n   - The code is minimal and straightforward, typical for module exports.\n\n2. **Issues or Malicious Activity**:\n   - None of the reports identify any actual issues or suspicious behavior.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - Security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1, which is still very low and likely due to the minimal nature of the code.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n   - Confidence scores are high (1), reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores**:\n   - Since the code is purely a module interface with no data processing, no external inputs, and no suspicious patterns, the risk scores should remain very low.\n   - The one report's 0.1 security risk seems slightly high given the code's benign nature; a score of 0 is more appropriate.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions or Claims**:\n   - All reports correctly challenge any assumptions about malicious intent; they recognize the code as benign.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a simple, standard module export pattern.\n   - No malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Security risk score**: 0 (the 0.1 in one report is slightly overestimating; 0 is more accurate)\n- **Confidence**: 1\n\n**Summary**:\nThis code is benign, straightforward, and presents no security risks. The scores should reflect that, with zero for malware and obfuscation, and a minimal security risk score of 0.",
