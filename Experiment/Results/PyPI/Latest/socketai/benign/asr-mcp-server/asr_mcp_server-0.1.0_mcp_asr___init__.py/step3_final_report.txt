  "purpose": "Module exports two functions from the asr_api package for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from asr_api module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Import functions -> expose via __all__ list",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward module that imports two functions and exposes them via __all__. There are no data flows, input handling, network activity, or embedded secrets. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate. The only minor discrepancy is a report assigning a security risk of 0.1, which should be adjusted to 0 for consistency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. All evidence supports a score of zero across malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
