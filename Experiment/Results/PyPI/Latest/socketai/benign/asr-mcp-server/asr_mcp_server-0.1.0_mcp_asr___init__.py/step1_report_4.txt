{
  "purpose": "The code exports two functions, submit_asr_task and query_asr_task, from the asr_api module, likely to facilitate submitting and querying automatic speech recognition tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statement from asr_api module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data or potential data leaks; no use of untrusted input in the code snippet provided",
  "flows": "The code simply imports functions and defines __all__, no data flow involving untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected; code is straightforward and standard in structure",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from an external module and specifies them in __all__, indicating these are the public API components. There are no inputs, outputs, or complex logic within this snippet. The use of __all__ is common for defining module exports. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present. The code itself appears benign and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module export statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not handle data directly, nor does it perform any operations that could introduce vulnerabilities.",
