{
  "purpose": "The code exports two functions, submit_asr_task and query_asr_task, from the asr_api module, likely for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from the asr_api module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code only re-exports functions without additional logic, which is common and not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from an external module and explicitly defines them as the module's public interface. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The simplicity suggests a standard module export pattern, with no suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module that exports two functions, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign and typical for a Python package interface.",
