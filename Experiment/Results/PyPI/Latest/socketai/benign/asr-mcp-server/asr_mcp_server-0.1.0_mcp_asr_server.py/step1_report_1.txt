{
  "purpose": "The code provides a tool for converting audio URLs to text using an external ASR service, integrating with mcp server framework.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'APP_ID' and 'TOKEN', input parameter 'url', and data fetched from external query responses.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the environment variables could be misused if compromised; the query response data could leak information if intercepted.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are used as credentials for submit_asr_task and query_asr_task; query responses are processed to extract text; the text is returned as output.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies on environment variables for credentials, which is standard; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or backdoors observed; no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script interfaces with external services for speech-to-text conversion, using environment variables for credentials and polling for task completion. It handles response data carefully, checking for expected status codes and JSON structures. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. No data leaks or insecure code patterns identified. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of an external API call within a framework, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation for speech-to-text conversion via external API, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It handles input and output appropriately, relying on environment variables for credentials, which is standard practice.",
