  "purpose": "This code provides a tool to convert audio URLs to text using an external ASR service, integrating with the mcp framework.",
  "sources": "Environment variables APP_ID and TOKEN, user-provided URL input.",
  "sinks": "Use of environment variables for credentials, network requests to submit and query ASR tasks, JSON parsing of responses.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> submit_asr_task/query_asr_task -> response parsing -> returning TextContent.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic code execution. The code relies on environment variables for credentials, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves credentials from environment variables and uses them to interact with an external service for speech-to-text conversion. It performs network requests and processes responses. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code's flow is straightforward, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate implementation of a tool to perform speech recognition through an external service, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
