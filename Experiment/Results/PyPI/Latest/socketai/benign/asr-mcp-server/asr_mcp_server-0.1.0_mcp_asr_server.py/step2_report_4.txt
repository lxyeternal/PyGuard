  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward integration with an external ASR service.\n- Credentials are retrieved via environment variables, which is standard practice.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are noted.\n- The code performs polling via a loop with sleep, which is typical for asynchronous task handling.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware, are identified.\n- The responses are handled cautiously, with checks on status codes and JSON structures.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated scores are all 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern, mainly related to reliance on environment variables and external network calls, which are standard in such contexts.\n- The purpose, sources, sinks, and flow descriptions are consistent and align with a legitimate external API integration.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- Since all reports agree on the benign nature, there are no contradictions or assumptions that need challenging.\n- The use of environment variables for credentials, while standard, could be a concern if the environment is compromised, but this is outside the scope of code review.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- **Malware score (0):** No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score (~0.2):** Slightly elevated due to external dependencies and credential handling, but overall low.\n\n**Final assessment:**\nGiven the consistent and thorough reviews, the code appears to be a legitimate implementation for speech-to-text conversion via an external API, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (code is clear)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (standard external API integration with environment variables; minimal risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical, secure implementation for integrating with an external ASR service, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
