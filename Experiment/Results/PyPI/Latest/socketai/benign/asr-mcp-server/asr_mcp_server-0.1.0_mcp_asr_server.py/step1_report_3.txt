{
  "purpose": "This code implements an audio-to-text conversion tool using the FastMCP framework and external ASR services, facilitating integration into a larger system.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables 'APP_ID' and 'TOKEN', and makes network requests via submit_asr_task and query_asr_task functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses untrusted data in network requests (via environment variables), and processes responses from external services which could potentially be manipulated.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> submit_asr_task / query_asr_task -> response headers and JSON data -> processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "Relies on environment variables for credentials, but this is standard practice; no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious data handling observed. The code uses an infinite loop with sleep for polling, which is typical for asynchronous task management but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses environment variables for credentials, making it flexible but not suspicious. It performs network requests to external services for ASR processing, and processes the responses carefully, checking for success codes and handling errors. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The polling loop is standard for asynchronous APIs. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are detected. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate implementation of an ASR integration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an external speech recognition service integration. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. It handles credentials securely via environment variables and processes responses cautiously. No signs of malware or malicious intent are present.",
