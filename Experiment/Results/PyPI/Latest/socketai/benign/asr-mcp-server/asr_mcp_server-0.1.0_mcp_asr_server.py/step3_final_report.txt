{
  "purpose": "The code integrates with an external speech-to-text API, submitting audio URLs for transcription and polling for results, then returning the transcribed text.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'APP_ID' and 'TOKEN' for credentials; external functions 'submit_asr_task' and 'query_asr_task' for API interaction; response headers and JSON data for processing.",
  "sinks": "Response headers and JSON responses where untrusted data could influence control flow or data extraction.",
  "flows": "Credentials from environment variables are used in API requests; responses are checked for status codes; JSON data is parsed to extract 'text' from the result object.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client for speech recognition, utilizing environment variables for credentials, with proper response validation and polling. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The logic is sound, and the response handling is cautious. No signs of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. The security risk stems mainly from external dependencies and credential management, which are standard practices. The malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero; the low security risk score (~0.2) is appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, low-risk implementation for speech-to-text conversion, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned are consistent with its functionality and security posture.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
