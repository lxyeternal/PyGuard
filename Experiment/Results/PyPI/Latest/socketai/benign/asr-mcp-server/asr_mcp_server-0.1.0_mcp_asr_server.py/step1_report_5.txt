{
  "purpose": "This code implements an audio-to-text conversion tool using the FastMCP framework, submitting tasks to an external ASR service and querying results.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'APP_ID' and 'TOKEN' for authentication, input URL parameter for audio source, external API calls within 'submit_asr_task' and 'query_asr_task'.",
  "sinks": "Use of environment variables and external API responses; no direct sinks for untrusted data manipulation within the code itself.",
  "flows": "Input URL and environment variables provide data to external API functions; responses are processed and returned as TextContent objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; environment variables are used securely; no obfuscated or suspicious code structures; external API usage appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code fetches credentials from environment variables, submits an ASR task via external functions, polls for completion, and returns the transcribed text. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code relies on external APIs and environment variables, which is typical for such applications. There are no signs of malware, data leakage, or harmful actions. The API response handling appears standard and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an ASR client using external services. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appropriately manages credentials via environment variables and performs expected operations without security risks.",
