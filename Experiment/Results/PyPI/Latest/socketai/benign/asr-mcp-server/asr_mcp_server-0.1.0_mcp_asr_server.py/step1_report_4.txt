{
  "purpose": "The code provides a tool for converting audio URLs to text using an external ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) service via the FastMCP framework.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables 'APP_ID' and 'TOKEN'; calls external functions submit_asr_task and query_asr_task; receives data via HTTP response headers and JSON content.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables (potentially sensitive); makes network requests via external functions; processes JSON data from responses.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → submit_asr_task / query_asr_task → response headers and JSON data → extraction and return of TextContent objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; code appears straightforward. No suspicious network domains or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script utilizes environment variables for sensitive credentials, which is standard practice. It makes network requests through imported functions; the responses are checked for expected status codes. The looping construct polls for task completion, which is normal. The code does not include any suspicious operations like data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. All operations seem aligned with expected functionality of a speech-to-text conversion tool. No anomalies, malicious behavior, or security issues identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a speech recognition service interface, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely handles sensitive data via environment variables and performs expected operations.",
