  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the code to ensure consistency, correctness, and appropriateness of the scores.\n\n**1. Code Functionality Confirmation:**\n- The code interacts with external APIs (`submit_asr_task`, `query_asr_task`) to perform speech-to-text conversion.\n- It uses environment variables (`APP_ID`, `TOKEN`) for credentials.\n- It polls for task completion and processes JSON responses to extract text.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code segments are present.\n- The logic appears straightforward and aligns with standard API interaction patterns.\n\n**2. Error and Logical Analysis:**\n- The code checks for specific status codes (`20000000` for success, `20000001`, `20000002` for ongoing or queued tasks, and others for failure). This is typical.\n- Response data is validated before extracting `text`.\n- The loop uses `time.sleep(0.5)` for polling, which is standard.\n- No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n**3. Score Evaluation:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign `0`. Given the code's straightforward API interaction, no malicious activity is apparent. The environment variables are standard for credential management.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign `0`. The code is clear, not obfuscated.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign `0.2`. This seems reasonable, considering the use of environment variables for credentials and external API calls, which could be potential attack vectors if credentials are compromised. The code itself doesn't introduce additional risks.\n\n**4. Justification for Scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.2, which aligns with the analysis that the code is low-risk.\n- Malware or obfuscation scores are consistently zero, matching the code's clarity and functionality.\n\n**5. Consistency and Potential Discrepancies:**\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment.\n- The scores are reasonable given the code's nature.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; the analysis is cautious and justified.\n\n**6. Final Recommendations:**\n- The overall security posture of this code is sound.\n- The scores reflect the low risk and benign nature.\n- No adjustments are necessary unless new context emerges.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — Slightly elevated due to use of environment variables for credentials and external API calls, but overall low.\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a legitimate, low-risk implementation for speech-to-text conversion, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to prepare a summarized report or provide specific recommendations?**",
