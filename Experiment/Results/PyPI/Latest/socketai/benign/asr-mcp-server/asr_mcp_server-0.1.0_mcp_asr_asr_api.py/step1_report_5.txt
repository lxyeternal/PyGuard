{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to submit an audio processing task and query its status from an external API, likely for speech recognition.",
  "sources": "app_id, app_token, audio_url, task_id, x_tt_log_id (inputs from function parameters and response headers), uuid4 generated task_id",
  "sinks": "requests.post calls that send data to external API endpoints; response headers that may include status codes and log IDs",
  "flows": "Inputs (app_id, app_token, audio_url) used to generate headers and request body; request sent via requests.post; response headers checked for status; response data returned or process exited",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials; use of standard libraries; response headers are checked for status codes; no obfuscated code or unusual control flow; commented-out code does not appear malicious; no data exfiltration or suspicious network behavior; use of exit() for error handling could disrupt processes but is not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API interaction to submit and query tasks, with proper use of UUID for unique request IDs. It handles responses by checking headers for status codes and logs log IDs. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident. The request payloads and URLs appear legitimate for an external speech API. No malicious or suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection observed. The code structure and logic are straightforward and typical for API communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an API client for speech recognition tasks. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. It performs expected actions such as request submission and status querying without evidence of harmful intent.",
