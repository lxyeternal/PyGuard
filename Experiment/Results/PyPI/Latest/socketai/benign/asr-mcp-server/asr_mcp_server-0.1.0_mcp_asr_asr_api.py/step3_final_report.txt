  "purpose": "API client for submitting and querying speech recognition tasks via HTTP requests to a specified API endpoint.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed into functions (app_id, app_token, audio_url, task_id, x_tt_log_id); response headers for status codes and log IDs.",
  "sinks": "Response headers used to determine success; no untrusted data sinks identified; potential risk from handling API credentials and abrupt termination.",
  "flows": "Function inputs (app_id, app_token, audio_url) used to construct headers and request payloads; responses checked via headers; on success, returns task_id and log id; on failure, exits.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `exit(1)` for error handling; `requests.post()` with `data=json.dumps()` instead of `json=`; hardcoded 'user.uid' as 'fake_uid'; reliance on custom header 'X-Api-Status-Code' instead of standard HTTP status code.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs API requests with provided credentials and audio URL, generating UUIDs for request IDs. Response handling depends on custom headers, with minimal validation of response content. The use of `exit(1)` is abrupt; request payloads could be improved by using `json=` parameter. The 'fake_uid' appears to be a placeholder. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior. Minor improvements include better error handling and response validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward API client with no malicious intent or malicious code detected. The primary concerns are coding practices rather than security issues. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score around 0.2 is appropriate given the handling of sensitive data. No further action is necessary.",
