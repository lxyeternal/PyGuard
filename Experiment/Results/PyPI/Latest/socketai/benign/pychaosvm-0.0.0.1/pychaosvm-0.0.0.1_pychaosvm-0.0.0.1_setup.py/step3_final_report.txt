  "purpose": "A minimal setup script for packaging a Python project called 'pychaosvm' with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Static strings in setup() parameters: name, version, author, author_email, description, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior; author fields are empty but not problematic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static 'setup.py' script importing 'setuptools' and calling 'setup()' with fixed metadata. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, or suspicious constructs. The description indicates a placeholder package. All signals point to benign, standard packaging code. No malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The empty author fields are typical for placeholders and do not constitute a security concern. The assigned scores in the reports are consistent with the code's benign nature, with the minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report being acceptable but slightly overestimating the risk; it could be lowered to 0. for accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard 'setup.py' placeholder script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scoring aligns with the code's simplicity. No modifications are necessary; the overall security posture is safe.",
