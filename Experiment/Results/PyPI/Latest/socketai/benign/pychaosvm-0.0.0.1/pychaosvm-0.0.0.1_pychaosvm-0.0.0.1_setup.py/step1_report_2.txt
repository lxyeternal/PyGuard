  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'pychaosvm' with basic metadata.",
  "sources": "Input sources are package metadata fields such as name, version, author, author_email, description, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks that handle untrusted data or perform data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining package metadata to calling the 'setup()' function, which processes this data to build the package.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious scripts are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious operations. The 'author' and 'author_email' fields are empty but this is not inherently malicious; they are often left blank intentionally. The classifiers are standard and do not suggest any malicious intent. Overall, this appears to be a benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward Python package setup script with no malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies detected. It appears to be a placeholder or template package definition.",
