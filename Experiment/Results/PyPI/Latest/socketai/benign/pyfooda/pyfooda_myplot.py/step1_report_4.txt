{
  "purpose": "The code provides generic plotting functions for visualizing data distributions and binary indicator combinations using matplotlib and upsetplot.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from DataFrame objects; no external input sources or untrusted data inputs are directly read within these functions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are visual plots generated via matplotlib; no data leaks or untrusted data outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrame columns into plotting functions, resulting in visual plots. No untrusted data is transmitted externally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code appears standard for data visualization purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two functions: plot_histogram and plot_upset_generic. Both functions accept DataFrame objects and parameters for plotting. They process the data minimally, mainly dropping NaNs or converting indicators, and generate visualizations using established libraries. There are no indications of malicious activities, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. No external network calls, file manipulations, or code injections are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to common data plotting patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data visualization functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and appears solely for visual data analysis.",
