{
  "purpose": "The code provides generic plotting functions for visualizing data, including histograms and UpSet plots, using pandas DataFrames.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from pandas DataFrames (df), specifically from columns specified by the user.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects; plotting functions generally do not process untrusted input insecurely.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the DataFrame (source) through plotting functions with minimal processing, ending at visualization output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard plotting libraries and functions with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries for plotting (matplotlib and upsetplot) and numerical processing (numpy). It defines two functions: one for plotting histograms and another for plotting UpSet plots. Both functions accept DataFrames and column names as parameters and generate visualizations. The code contains docstrings explaining parameters and purpose. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or sensitive data handling; all operations are standard visualization procedures. The code does not include any suspicious behavior, such as dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or obfuscated segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data visualization utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. It is safe to use, assuming the DataFrame inputs are trusted and used appropriately.",
