{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for plotting histograms and UpSet plots from DataFrame data.",
  "sources": "Reads data from DataFrame columns (e.g., df[column], indicator columns).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data exfiltration or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from DataFrame inputs through plotting functions; no external or insecure data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard visualization functions utilizing common libraries (matplotlib, upsetplot, numpy). It operates solely on provided DataFrame data, with no network, file, or dynamic code execution. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present. The functions are straightforward wrappers for plotting, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and low security risk scores (~0.1), which are appropriate given the context. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data visualization utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scoring provided in the reports is accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
