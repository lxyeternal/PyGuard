{
  "purpose": "The code provides generic plotting functions for visualizing data distributions and combinations of binary indicators using matplotlib and upsetplot.",
  "sources": "DataFrame inputs for plotting functions, specifically df and indicator_columns, and external libraries matplotlib and upsetplot.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data sinks or outputs that could leak untrusted data; it simply visualizes data provided by the user.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the DataFrame to plotting functions, with user-supplied data passed into functions and then visualized without further data manipulation or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The functions are standard data visualization routines, and no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two data visualization functions: one for histograms and another for UpSet plots. Both functions accept DataFrame data and parameters to customize the plots. The code imports only well-known plotting libraries (matplotlib and upsetplot) and uses standard data handling with pandas DataFrames. There are no external data transmissions, no use of environment variables for secrets, and no code execution or injection mechanisms present. The structure and content align with typical data plotting scripts without obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign data visualization utility with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
