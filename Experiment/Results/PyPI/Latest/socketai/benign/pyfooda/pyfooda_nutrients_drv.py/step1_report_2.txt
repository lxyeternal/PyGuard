{
  "purpose": "Provide a hardcoded list of nutrients with non-zero daily recommended values (DRV) and return it as a list and as a pandas DataFrame.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a hardcoded list of dictionaries within the function get_nutrients_with_drv().",
  "sinks": "The data is returned directly from functions; there are no external data sinks or untrusted data handling beyond returning static data.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the hardcoded list in get_nutrients_with_drv() into the DataFrame creation in get_nutrients_with_drv_df().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the data is static and hardcoded. No code injection, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code present. No unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static data representing nutrients with their properties and recommended daily values. It provides functions to retrieve this data as a list or as a pandas DataFrame with renamed columns. There is no external input, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution. The data appears to be standard nutrient information without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The functions are straightforward, purely returning static data structures, indicating low risk of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, providing static nutritional data without any suspicious or malicious components. It contains no external data handling, no obfuscated code, and no signs of malicious behavior. Overall security risk is very low.",
