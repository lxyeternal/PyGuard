{
  "purpose": "The code provides a hardcoded list of nutrients with their recommended daily values (DRV) and offers a function to return this list as a pandas DataFrame.",
  "sources": "The data is hardcoded within the get_nutrients_with_drv() function; no external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The functions return static data; there are no sinks where untrusted data could be exploited or leaked.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the hardcoded list in get_nutrients_with_drv() to the pandas DataFrame via get_nutrients_with_drv_df() method.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code primarily handles static data and simple data transformation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static list of nutrients with associated DRV values, then provides functions to retrieve this list as a list of dictionaries or as a pandas DataFrame. There are no external inputs, network communications, or data manipulations involving untrusted sources. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior detected. The data appears to be a straightforward representation of nutritional information. The functions serve as static data providers, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static data provider for nutritional information. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The functions simply return predefined data in list or DataFrame format. Overall security risk and malware likelihood are extremely low.",
