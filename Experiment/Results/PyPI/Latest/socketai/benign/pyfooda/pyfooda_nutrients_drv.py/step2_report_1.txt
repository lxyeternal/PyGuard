  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, following the step-by-step instructions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; static data of nutrients and DRVs, converted into a DataFrame.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No errors or suspicious behavior. The data is static and straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** The score of 0.5 for risk might be conservative; since the code is static and harmless, 0 is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0.\n- **Assumptions:** No assumptions about vulnerabilities; the code is static.\n- **Consistency:** Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code is static, similar to Report 1.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No errors or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No security concern; static data, no external inputs.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0.\n- **Assumptions:** No assumptions; the data is benign.\n- **Consistency:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; static data, no external data handling.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** Correct.\n- **Assumptions:** None.\n- **Consistency:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Static data, straightforward functions.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No risk of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** Correct.\n- **Assumptions:** None.\n- **Consistency:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern; static data, simple transformation.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** Correct.\n- **Assumptions:** None.\n- **Consistency:** Scores align.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports correctly identify the code as static, benign data providers.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None detected.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware justification:** The code contains no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or dynamic behaviors. Static data is harmless.\n- **Assumptions:** The reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities.\n- **Score consistency:** The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation\n\nGiven the static, non-executable, data-only nature of the code, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\nThe reports are accurate and conservative in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, static data with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are appropriate and consistent. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware score: **0.0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0.0**  \n- Risk score: **0.0**",
