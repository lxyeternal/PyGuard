{
  "purpose": "Provide a hardcoded list of nutrients with non-zero dietary reference values (DRVs) and return it as a list or DataFrame.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; data is hardcoded within the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the data structure; no untrusted data handling or external sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; data is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, using standard data structures and pandas for data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: one returns a static list of dictionaries representing nutrients with their details and DRVs; the second converts this list into a pandas DataFrame with renamed columns. The data is static and hardcoded, with no dynamic input, external data fetching, or execution of code based on external untrusted inputs. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network calls, system modifications, or obfuscated logic, is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves to supply a predefined dataset. There is no malicious intent or security risk identified. The functions simply return static data structures for use elsewhere.",
