{
  "purpose": "Provides a hardcoded list of nutrients with their dietary reference values (DRVs) and a function to return this data as a pandas DataFrame.",
  "sources": "The hardcoded list of nutrients within the get_nutrients_with_drv() function.",
  "sinks": "The pandas DataFrame returned by get_nutrients_with_drv_df(), which may be used downstream for analysis or display.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the hardcoded nutrient list in get_nutrients_with_drv() to the DataFrame in get_nutrients_with_drv_df().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. No use of external inputs, environment variables, or network operations is detected. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static data within a function, representing nutrients and their DRVs. It then provides a straightforward transformation into a pandas DataFrame, with renaming of some columns for clarity. The logic is simple and static, with no external data sources, network calls, or user inputs. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The code is purely for data representation and transformation without any side effects or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only static data and basic data manipulation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It functions as a data provider for nutritional information, with no malicious intent.",
