{
  "purpose": "Provide a hardcoded list of nutrients with their daily recommended values (DRVs) for use in dietary analysis.",
  "sources": "The data is hardcoded within the get_nutrients_with_drv() function as a list of dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "The get_nutrients_with_drv_df() function converts the list into a pandas DataFrame, renaming some columns.",
  "flows": "The hardcoded list flows into the pandas DataFrame creation, with column renaming as a transformation step.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present. The code strictly defines and returns static data, with no dynamic input or external data sources. No obfuscated code, hidden behavior, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two functions: one returning a static list of dictionaries representing nutrient data, including IDs, names, units, categories, and DRV values; the second function converts this list into a pandas DataFrame and renames specific columns for clarity. The data appears to be a predefined dataset, typical for dietary or nutritional applications. There are no indications of malicious payloads, external data access, or obfuscated code. The use of pandas is standard and does not introduce security risks. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward data definition and transformation, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data provider for nutrient information, with no malicious or suspicious activity. It serves as a static data source with standard data handling, presenting no security concerns.",
