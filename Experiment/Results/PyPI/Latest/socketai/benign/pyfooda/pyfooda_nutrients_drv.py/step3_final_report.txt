  "purpose": "Provides a static list of nutrients with their daily reference values (DRVs) and converts it into a pandas DataFrame for further use.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded data within the get_nutrients_with_drv() function.",
  "sinks": "The DataFrame returned by get_nutrients_with_drv_df(), which could be used downstream for analysis or display.",
  "flows": "Data is defined as a list of dictionaries, returned by get_nutrients_with_drv(), then transformed into a DataFrame with renamed columns in get_nutrients_with_drv_df().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; static data with no external inputs, network activity, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining static nutritional data and converting it into a DataFrame. No external data sources, user inputs, or dynamic code execution are present. The data appears to be standard nutritional information, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads. The functions are simple and do not perform any risky operations. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static data provider for nutritional information. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
