{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to load and query food and nutrient data from CSV files stored locally, with lazy loading to optimize repeated access.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV files ('data/foods.csv' and 'data/nutrients.csv') upon first access via pandas.read_csv.",
  "sinks": "Returns data extracted from DataFrames, including string data and numerical values. No data outputs to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from CSV files (sources) into DataFrames; functions then retrieve and process this data, returning results to callers. No external data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Use of global variables is typical for caching data. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code loads CSV data into pandas DataFrames and provides various accessor functions. It uses standard pandas operations for filtering and retrieving data. All file reads are from local files, and no network activity, code injection, or unsafe operations are present. No unusual or suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are detected. The code structure is straightforward and consistent with common data handling practices. Functions perform expected tasks without side effects or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data access module for food and nutrient information stored locally. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. It employs standard practices for data loading and retrieval, with no signs of supply chain attacks or malicious code.",
