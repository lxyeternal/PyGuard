  "purpose": "Provides functions to load, query, and analyze food and nutrient data from CSV files for nutritional analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads 'data/foods.csv' and 'data/nutrients.csv' files; user input strings for food names and partial matches.",
  "sinks": "Data filtering operations within pandas DataFrames; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input strings are used in pandas filtering to locate rows; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of global variables for caching data; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code features.",
  "analysis": "The code loads CSV data into pandas DataFrames, caching them globally. Functions perform straightforward filtering based on user input, returning categories, nutrients, portion sizes, or partial matches. No external network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The use of global variables is a design choice but not malicious. The data handling is safe assuming CSV files are secure. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code are detected. The code's purpose is data access, with no evident vulnerabilities or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data access layer for nutritional information, with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1). The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
