{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to load and query food and nutrient data from CSV files stored locally.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV files 'data/foods.csv' and 'data/nutrients.csv' during data loading.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; functions return data or perform lookups based on input parameters.",
  "flows": "User input (foodName, partialName) is used to filter DataFrames; no external data or network communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No use of dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code loads local CSV files upon first access, using pandas. It provides functions to retrieve specific data points, categories, nutrient info, and partial matches. All input parameters are used solely for DataFrame filtering, with no evident handling of untrusted data that could lead to injection or data leaks. There are no external network calls, reverse shells, or malicious behaviors. The code appears standard for a data access module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data access layer for food and nutrient information stored in local CSV files. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious code, backdoors, or malware indicators. There are no security risks detected in this implementation.",
