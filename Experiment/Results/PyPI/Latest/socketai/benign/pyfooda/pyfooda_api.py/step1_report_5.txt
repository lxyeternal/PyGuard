{
  "purpose": "Provide functions to access and retrieve nutritional data from CSV files for specific foods.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV files ('data/foods.csv' and 'data/nutrients.csv') when data is not loaded, via pandas.read_csv.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; functions return data from DataFrames or perform lookups. No untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from CSVs into DataFrames; functions filter DataFrames based on foodName inputs, returning specific data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of global variables for data caching is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code loads CSV files containing food and nutrient data into pandas DataFrames, caching them globally. Multiple functions perform lookups based on food names, using case-insensitive matching. Data is returned directly without modification or external communication. No dynamic code execution, no external input handling beyond data lookup, and no insecure operations are present. The code is straightforward, standard for data access layers, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data access layer with no malicious intent. It safely loads CSV data and provides lookup functions. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malware indicators are evident.",
