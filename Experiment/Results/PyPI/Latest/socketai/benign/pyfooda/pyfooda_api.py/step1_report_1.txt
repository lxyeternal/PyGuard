{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for loading and querying food and nutrient data from CSV files, including searching for food items and retrieving their attributes.",
  "sources": "Data is read from local CSV files 'data/foods.csv' and 'data/nutrients.csv' when functions are called, specifically within the ensure_data_loaded() function which loads data into global variables if not already loaded.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or send data externally. It reads data from local files; there are no sinks for untrusted input leading to data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "The functions load data from CSV files (sources), store it in global variables, and provide access to this data via query functions. No untrusted data from external sources is processed beyond initial file reading; user inputs (like foodName, partialName) are used to filter data within DataFrames but are handled safely with pandas methods.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward without obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The use of global variables and file reads is standard for data loading.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes data loading functions that read CSV files into DataFrames, then provides accessor functions that query these DataFrames based on user input strings, performing case-insensitive searches and returning data. All inputs are handled via pandas filtering; there is no indication of malicious intent or malicious data handling. No external network operations, system modifications, or secret data processing are present. The functions are designed for data retrieval only, and the code structure is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data access layer for local CSV files, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It appears to serve legitimate purposes related to data querying and retrieval, with no suspicious or harmful features detected.",
