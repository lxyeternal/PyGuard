  "purpose": "The code processes and consolidates food and nutrient data from CSV files for analysis and storage, involving data cleaning, merging, transformation, and export.",
  "sources": "File reading operations from local CSV files within the specified directory, including 'food.csv', 'food_category.csv', 'wweia_food_category.csv', 'food_nutrient.csv', 'food_portion.csv', and 'measure_unit.csv'.",
  "sinks": "Data exported to CSV and Excel files in the 'data' directory ('foods.csv', 'foods.xlsx', 'nutrients.csv', 'nutrients.xlsx'). No network transmission or sensitive data exposure observed.",
  "flows": "Data is read from CSV files (sources), processed and merged through pandas DataFrame operations, and finally written to output files (sinks). No external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or suspicious functions are present. The code performs typical data handling tasks. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard data loading from local CSV files, with reasonable merging and transformation steps. It includes converting energy units, filtering data, and saving processed data locally. No signs of malicious activity, code injection, or backdoors are detected. The operations are consistent with data analysis workflows, and no external network communications or sensitive information handling are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data processing script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It adheres to normal data handling practices and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
