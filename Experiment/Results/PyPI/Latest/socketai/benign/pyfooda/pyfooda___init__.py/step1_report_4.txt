The code appears standard for a package initialization or interface definition.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code imports multiple functions from a local 'api' module, indicating modular design. The functions likely handle data retrieval and processing related to food or nutrition information. The only other statement is a version string declaration. No external data sources, sinks, or potentially malicious code are present. The structure is typical for a package's \\_\\_init\\_\\_.py or main module setup.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is a straightforward import and version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be part of a legitimate package setup, with no anomalous or malicious patterns.\",\n  \"confidence\": 1,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0\n}",
