  "purpose": "This code imports functions from a local module and sets a version string, serving as part of a larger package interface.",
  "sources": "Import statements from '.api' module, setting __version__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no external network activity, no data leaks",
  "flows": "Import statements and version assignment are isolated; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements and a version string. No suspicious or malicious behavior, data flow, or external interactions are present. The code's simplicity and lack of dynamic or network activity indicate a benign nature. All reports correctly identify this as a safe, standard module fragment with no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and risk scores at 0 or very close to 0. No further action is necessary.",
