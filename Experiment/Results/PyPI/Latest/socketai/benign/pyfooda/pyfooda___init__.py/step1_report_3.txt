{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions from a local module named 'api' and define a version string for the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .api module, reading the module's functions; assignment of __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or exported.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports functions and defines a version string.",
  "anomalies": "Only standard import and variable assignment; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several functions from a relative module 'api', indicating modular design. The functions seem to be related to food data processing, and the version string is standard for package versioning. No suspicious or malicious activity is visible in this minimal snippet. There are no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as an import interface and version declaration. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
