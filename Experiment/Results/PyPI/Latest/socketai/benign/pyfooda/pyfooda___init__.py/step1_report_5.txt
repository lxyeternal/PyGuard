  "purpose": "Import functions related to food data processing from a local api module and set package version.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local api module",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output functions present",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows or processing logic present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for a module import and version declaration",
  "analysis": "The code only imports several functions from a relative api module and sets a version string. There are no inputs, no data processing, no execution of untrusted data, or dynamic code execution. The structure and content are typical for a Python package __init__.py file. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import and version assignment with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
