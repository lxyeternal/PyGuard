{
  "purpose": "This code appears to import functions related to food data processing and sets a version string, likely part of a larger food or nutrition-related package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.api) for functions that handle food data retrieval and processing.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data output, external connections, or untrusted data handling shown in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A - only import and version assignment are present; no data flow or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, importing functions and defining a version.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple functions from a relative module, indicating modular design. No dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious code structures are present. The setting of __version__ is standard practice for package versioning. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. As this is only a fragment, it does not perform any dangerous actions by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import and version declaration, with no malicious intent or security concerns identified in this snippet.",
