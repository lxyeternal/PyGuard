{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions related to food data processing and sets a version string.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .api, which likely reads internal module data or functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there is no untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only internal imports and a version string are set.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "This code primarily imports functions from a local module, possibly for further use elsewhere. The presence of an internal relative import indicates it's part of a larger package. The only other statement sets a version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module import and version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
