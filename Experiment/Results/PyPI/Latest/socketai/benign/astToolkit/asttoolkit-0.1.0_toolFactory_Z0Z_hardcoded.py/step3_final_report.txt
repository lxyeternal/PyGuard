{
  "purpose": "Define type alias, set package and path variables, specify Python version info, and declare a custom exception.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments, import statements, class definition",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data handling present",
  "flows": "None; code is static and does not process data at runtime",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static setup with a custom exception named 'FREAKOUT'",
  "analysis": "The code is static, with no external input, data processing, or network/file I/O. It defines type aliases, constructs filesystem paths, specifies version tuples, and declares a harmless custom exception. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and static nature justify malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). The exception class name 'FREAKOUT' is unusual but harmless. All reports correctly assess the benign nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static configuration code with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
