  "purpose": "Define type alias, package paths, system version info, and a custom exception.",
  "sources": "None of the sources appear to read untrusted input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or pose security risks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and does not contain unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated parts.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type aliases, defines package and path variables, system version info, and a custom exception class. All elements are static, with no dynamic input handling or external data reading. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The custom exception class is standard and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It primarily prepares some configuration variables and a custom exception class for use in a larger project.",
