  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code provided.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of static variable definitions, imports, and a simple custom exception class. There are no dynamic inputs, no data processing, no external data reading, and no code execution based on untrusted sources.\n   - The code does not contain any obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n   - Therefore, **no issues or vulnerabilities are present** in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, static, and benign.\n   - They consistently note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `obfuscated` scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The `confidence` scores are 1, reflecting certainty in their assessments.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's characteristics.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is static, with no external input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns, **risk scores higher than 0.1 are unwarranted**.\n   - The minimal `securityRisk` score of 0.1 in some reports is acceptable, but even that might be slightly high given the benign nature.\n   - Overall, a `securityRisk` of 0 or 0.1 is justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - There is no malicious activity, code injection, or backdoor present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as configuration/setup code.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are based on assumptions; all are consistent with the static, benign code.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence levels are high, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, just to acknowledge the code's static setup nature)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is entirely benign, static configuration code with no security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the actual code content.",
