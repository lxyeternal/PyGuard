  "purpose": "Define type alias and initialize package paths and version info variables for a Python package named 'astToolkit'.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'pathlib' and 'typing', variable assignments for package paths and version info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only initializes variables and defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The code defines paths and version info with no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, defines type aliases, assigns fixed path locations, version tuples, and a custom exception class. All operations are straightforward initializations and definitions. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as setup or configuration for a package. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
