  "purpose": "Define type aliases and set up package and path variables for a Python project.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data is written to files, network, or other sinks; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines constants and paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are observed. The class 'FREAKOUT' is a custom exception but without malicious context.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for filesystem paths and typing. It defines type aliases, package-related paths, and version tuples. The code is static, setting up variables without processing untrusted input or performing operations that could be malicious. The custom exception class is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or unusual language features are used. All code appears to be purely for configuration or setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, serving as configuration or setup code with no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It does not process untrusted data or perform any network or file operations beyond variable definitions.",
