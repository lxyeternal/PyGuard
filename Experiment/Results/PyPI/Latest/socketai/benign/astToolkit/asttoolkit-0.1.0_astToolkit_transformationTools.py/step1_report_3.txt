{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for analyzing and manipulating Python ASTs, including inlining functions, removing unused parameters, converting AST modules to source code, and replacing AST nodes based on a mapping.",
  "sources": "Input sources include AST nodes from functions, modules, and mappings; data is read from AST structures via traversal and unparse comparisons.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing source code to files and inlining or modifying AST nodes, which could be exploited if malicious AST nodes are provided externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input AST structures through functions that manipulate and transform them, including inlining, removing unused parameters, and node replacement, before outputting modified source code or ASTs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. Use of 'deepcopy' and complex AST manipulations are typical for code analysis tools. No unusual or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard AST manipulations: creating function dictionaries, inlining functions, removing unused parameters, converting AST to source, and replacing nodes. All these functions rely on AST traversal and modification, with no evidence of malicious behavior. There are no network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms present. The only notable aspect is the comprehensive AST handling, which is typical in code analysis and transformation tools, not malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured utility for AST analysis and transformation, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It does not contain suspicious network or system access patterns. The code's complexity is consistent with standard code analysis and transformation practices.",
