  "purpose": "Utility functions for manipulating Python AST nodes, including appending, extracting, inserting, removing, replacing, and updating node attributes.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to functions, such as nodes, lists, dictionaries, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Modifications to data structures (lists, dicts), AST nodes, and potential placeholders like 'removeIt' which returns None.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input nodes or collections through functions that modify or replace them; no external system or network interactions are involved.",
  "anomalies": "The 'removeIt' method returns None without performing any actual removal, indicating an incomplete implementation but not malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward, standard utility functions for AST node manipulation. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The functions operate on provided data structures and nodes, with potential misuse if fed untrusted data, but this is typical for such utilities. The 'removeIt' method appears incomplete but harmless. Overall, the code is benign and intended for code transformation workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility module for AST manipulation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The potential for misuse exists if inputs are untrusted, but the code itself is safe. The scores are consistent with this assessment.",
