{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for AST node transformation and manipulation, such as appending, inserting, replacing, and updating AST nodes or attributes.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading external input; functions operate on provided AST nodes, attributes, or lists.",
  "targets": "Functions that modify AST nodes, attributes, or collections; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "AST nodes or attributes are passed to functions which modify or return them, with no external data flows or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, implementing common AST transformation patterns; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The module defines static methods for manipulating AST nodes, including appending nodes to a list, extracting nodes, inserting nodes before or after a given node, replacing nodes, and updating dictionary key-value pairs based on AST nodes. The functions use simple lambda expressions and standard list/dictionary operations. No external input reading, network access, or file operations are present. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility module for AST manipulation, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious activity. It is designed for code transformation tasks within Python code analysis or modification workflows.",
