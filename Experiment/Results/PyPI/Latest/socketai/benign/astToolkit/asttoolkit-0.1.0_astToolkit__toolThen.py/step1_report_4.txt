  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for manipulating AST nodes, including appending, extracting, inserting, removing, replacing, and updating AST nodes or attributes.",
  "sources": "The module imports data from 'collections.abc', 'astToolkit', 'typing', and 'ast'. No external input sources are present; the code operates on provided AST nodes or data structures.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include functions that modify AST nodes or dictionaries, which could be misused if fed untrusted data. Specifically, the 'updateKeyValueIn' method modifies a dictionary, which could lead to unintended behavior if misused, but not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "No external data flows are explicitly defined; functions operate on passed-in nodes or data structures. The methods generate callables for modifying or extracting data from AST nodes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic, are present. All functions perform standard manipulations on AST nodes or collections without side effects. The 'removeIt' method returns None but does not delete or remove nodes explicitly; it is a placeholder for removal logic, but on its own, it is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for AST manipulation, including appending nodes to lists, extracting nodes, inserting nodes before or after existing nodes, replacing nodes, and updating dictionary entries based on node attributes. The methods generate and return callables that perform these actions when invoked. There are no external input sources, network calls, or hidden behaviors. The functions are straightforward and adhere to standard AST handling patterns. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident. The 'removeIt' method might suggest node removal, but it merely returns None and does not perform any destructive actions by itself. Overall, the code is a typical utility module for AST manipulation with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of utility functions for AST node manipulation, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious actions. The functions are safe and serve legitimate purposes within an AST transformation framework.",
