{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for parsing string snippets into AST nodes, defining static methods for AST node manipulation, and constructing AST node definitions for attributes and import statements, likely for static code analysis or code generation.",
  "sources": "Parsing hardcoded string snippets into AST nodes, defining static methods, and constructing AST node definitions.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, network activity, or system modifications; purely AST node creation and manipulation.",
  "flows": "AST parsing of string snippets -> AST node creation -> static method definitions for AST manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward AST construction.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static AST parsing and node creation functions, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or external data handling. It appears to be part of a static analysis or code transformation utility. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for AST manipulation, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk scores are justified, and the malware scores correctly indicate no malicious activity.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
