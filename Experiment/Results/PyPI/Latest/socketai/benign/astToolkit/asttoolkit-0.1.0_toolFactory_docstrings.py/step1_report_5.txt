{
  "purpose": "The code provides docstring definitions for utility classes that assist with AST node type guarding, attribute access, and modification.",
  "sources": "The code contains static string definitions used as docstrings within class definitions, providing descriptions for type guards, accessors, and modifiers for AST nodes.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data flows into security-sensitive operations, such as network, file, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "The code is purely static documentation; there are no data flows or runtime data handling involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely static docstrings without executable logic, parameters, or dynamic code. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of string variables that hold detailed docstrings describing classes intended for AST node type verification, attribute access, and modification. There is no executable code, no data processing, and no interactions with external data sources. The absence of code execution, data handling, or network operations indicates no malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be a documentation or template module for AST manipulation tools, with no signs of sabotage, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is static documentation for AST utility classes. It contains no executable logic, data flows, or suspicious behavior. There are no security concerns or malware indicators in this fragment.",
