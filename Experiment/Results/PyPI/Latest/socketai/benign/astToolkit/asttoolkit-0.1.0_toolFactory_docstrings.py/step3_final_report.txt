  "purpose": "Static documentation strings describing classes for AST node type guards, attribute access, modification, and node creation.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static string variables containing class descriptions and usage explanations.",
  "sinks": "None; static strings do not process untrusted data or perform actions.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or execution occurs beyond variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "None; purely static, descriptive strings with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string variables containing class documentation for AST manipulation. There are no functions, executable code, data processing, or external interactions. The content is purely descriptive and static. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign, documentation-only nature of the code. The high confidence score (1) reflects certainty in this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless static documentation with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
