{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and extend AST nodes for static analysis or manipulation, including a subclass 'ImaCallToName' with an additional 'func' attribute.",
  "sources": "No external data input; code reads only type definitions, class inheritance, and attribute annotations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external outputs; no data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; code is purely structural with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Unicode variable name '\\u4e2a' is unconventional but benign; no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple type aliases for AST node classes, a subclass 'ImaCallToName' extending 'ast.Call' with an extra 'func' attribute, and broad union types for flexible static analysis. No external data, network activity, or runtime logic is present. The variable naming includes Unicode characters but does not impact security. The structure is straightforward and typical for AST tooling. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The code is purely structural, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup for AST analysis, involving type aliasing and subclassing, with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
