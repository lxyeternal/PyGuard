  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core points:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily about defining type aliases, subclasses, and organizing AST node types for static analysis or transformation.\n- No report identifies any malicious behavior, suspicious constructs, or malicious payloads.\n- The code is consistent, straightforward, and typical for tooling around Python AST manipulation.\n- The use of non-standard variable names (e.g., 个, \\u4e2a) appears benign and likely for stylistic or linguistic reasons.\n- The `ImaCallToName` subclass adds a `func` attribute to `ast.Call`, which seems intended for extending AST nodes with additional info, not malicious behavior.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or I/O operations are involved.\n- The type variables and unions are broad but serve static analysis purposes, not malicious intent.\n\n**Specific points per report:**\n- All reports assign a very high confidence (0.9) that the code is benign.\n- All assign malware and security risk scores of 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- No anomalies or obfuscation are noted; the code is clear and structural.\n\n**Potential issues or points of concern:**\n- The only unusual aspect is the variable name `个` (a Chinese character), which is benign but somewhat unconventional. This does not affect security but is worth noting as a stylistic choice.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code does not contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned in each report are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n- No changes are necessary to the scoring.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation; code is clear)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, well-structured setup for AST analysis, with no malicious or security concerns. The reported scores are appropriate, and I concur with the overall assessment that this code is safe and standard for static analysis tooling.",
