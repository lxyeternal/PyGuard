  "purpose": "Import specific functions and constants from modules within the toolFactory package, likely for further processing or analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load modules and specific attributes such as ast_Identifier, FREAKOUT, packageName, pathPackage, pathTypeshed, sys_version_infoMinimum, sys_version_infoTarget, list_astDOTnew, Z0Z_typesSpecial.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in these import statements; they are simply importing code modules and variables.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports without executing or passing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are evident. Import statements are standard and explicit.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward import statements from the toolFactory package, importing specific attributes and functions. No data processing, execution, or dynamic behavior is present. These imports appear to set up dependencies for later code execution. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden backdoors, or obfuscated code. The structure is clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement section, setting up dependencies for further processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues in these lines.",
