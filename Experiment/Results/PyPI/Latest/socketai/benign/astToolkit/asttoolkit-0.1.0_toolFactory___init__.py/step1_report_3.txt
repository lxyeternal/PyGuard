{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import specific functions and variables from two modules within the 'toolFactory' package, likely used for static analysis or code processing purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'toolFactory.Z0Z_hardcoded' and 'toolFactory.startHere' modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only import statements are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected. The import statements are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, referencing variables and functions that seem related to code analysis or tooling. There is no executable logic, no input handling, nor data manipulation, which reduces the likelihood of malicious behavior. The imported modules may perform internal analysis tasks, but based solely on these lines, no malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is purely import statements from internal tool modules with no signs of malicious code or security risks. The code appears benign and used for internal tooling or analysis purposes.",
