  "purpose": "Setup for AST analysis with static pattern identifiers and an unimplemented placeholder function.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded list of AST node type identifiers in 'list_astDOTnewHARDCODED'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions affecting system security.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static identifiers are assigned to a variable, and the function does nothing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of static, hardcoded string identifiers labeled 'HARDCODED'; the function is a stub with no logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines static lists of string identifiers related to AST node types, assigns one list to another, and declares an unimplemented function. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, malicious network activity, or data leaks. The static lists suggest configuration or pattern matching, not malicious intent. The function's lack of implementation indicates incomplete code or a placeholder. The static nature and naming do not raise security concerns. The scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk~0.1) are consistent with this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and incomplete, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
