  "purpose": "A GUI application for penetration and structural analysis, involving data input, calculations, and visualization, utilizing pickle files and external formula modules.",
  "sources": "Reads pickle files, user input fields, and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Writes pickle files, outputs to stdout (captured), and displays plots via matplotlib.",
  "flows": "User inputs and file data → data structures → formula calculations and visualizations.",
  "anomalies": "Uses sys.stdout redirection for output capture; imports external 'Penetration' module via relative import; handles pickle files which can execute arbitrary code if untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive GUI tool for analysis, with standard libraries and data handling. No network activity, obfuscation, or embedded malicious code is evident. The use of pickle poses security risks if untrusted files are loaded, but no malicious payloads are detected. The external module 'Penetration' is used for formula objects and appears standard in modular design. The stdout redirection is typical for GUI output display, not malicious. Overall, the code is structurally sound and does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate analysis GUI with low suspicion of malicious activity. The primary security concern is the handling of untrusted pickle files, which should be mitigated in deployment. The external module trustworthiness should be verified, but no malicious intent is apparent.",
