The primary concern is the use of pickle.load, which is standard but should be used with trusted data. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the analysis and appropriate for this context."

The primary security concern is the handling of untrusted pickle files, which should be mitigated in deployment. The external module trustworthiness should be verified, but no malicious intent is apparent."
