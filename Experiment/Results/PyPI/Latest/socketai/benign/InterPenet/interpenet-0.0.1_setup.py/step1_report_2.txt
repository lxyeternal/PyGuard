  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'InterPenet'.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; specifies package dependencies and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content to include as long description; installs required dependencies; packages project files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup.py usage with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious commands.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading a markdown file for description, specifying package info, dependencies, classifiers, license, and package data. No external inputs are processed dynamically beyond standard file reading. No network connections, code execution, or untrusted data handling present. The package data includes CSV files, which is standard. Overall, the script appears legitimate and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a normal, benign package configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
