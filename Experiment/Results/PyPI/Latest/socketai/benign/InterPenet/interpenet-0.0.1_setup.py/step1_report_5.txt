{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'InterPenet' that specifies package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description, imports 'setuptools' for packaging, and defines dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; the script only defines package metadata and dependencies, with no network or data flow beyond installation configuration.",
  "flows": "Reads external file for description; installs specified dependencies; configures package data and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Usage appears standard for a setup.py script.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package using 'setuptools'. It reads a README file for description and specifies dependencies. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or suspicious activity is present. All code is static configuration for package distribution, typical for setup files. There are no hidden behaviors or malicious constructs. It appears to be a benign package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
