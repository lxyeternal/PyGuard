{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package called 'InterPenet' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.md' file for long description; no other input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reads static file content into variable; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard setup procedures; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file to incorporate as long description, then calls 'setup()' with package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. All code follows standard Python packaging conventions. No external data input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious code patterns identified. The 'install_requires' specifies a common dependency on pandas. No indication of malicious intent or malicious code patterns, and the code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of packaging setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe to use in its intended context.",
