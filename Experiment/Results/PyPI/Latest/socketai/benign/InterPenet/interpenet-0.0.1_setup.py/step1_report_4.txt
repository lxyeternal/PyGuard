{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'InterPenet' Python module.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; package metadata such as name, version, author, and URL; list of required dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no user input or network operations; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; setup configuration is static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns. The package data includes '*.csv' files, which is standard and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a README file for the long description and uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. No code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The dependencies are explicitly specified, and the setup configuration appears standard. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code adheres to standard packaging practices and does not contain any suspicious or malicious elements.",
