  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'InterPenet' with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description, specifying dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "flows": "Reading the README file and setting up package metadata without any data flow concerns.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. The package_data pattern appears to have an empty string key which might be unintended but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, reads a Markdown file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and package data. There are no user inputs, network connections, or code execution flows that could be exploited maliciously. The use of 'package_data' with an empty string as a key is somewhat unconventional and could be a mistake, but it does not constitute malicious activity. Overall, the code functions as a standard setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include any suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or data leakage vectors.",
