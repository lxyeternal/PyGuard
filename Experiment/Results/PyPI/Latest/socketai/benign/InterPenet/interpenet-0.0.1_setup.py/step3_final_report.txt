{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'InterPenet' Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; specifies dependencies; defines package data with an unconventional empty string key.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network activity, or code execution points present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "The 'package_data' dictionary uses an empty string key ('': ['*.csv']), which is unconventional and likely a mistake but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The only unusual element is the 'package_data' key, which may not function as intended but does not pose security risks. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious patterns are detected. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, assigning malware scores of 0 and very low security risk scores. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is safe, standard, and free from malicious intent. The minor anomaly in 'package_data' is likely a configuration oversight rather than malicious. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
