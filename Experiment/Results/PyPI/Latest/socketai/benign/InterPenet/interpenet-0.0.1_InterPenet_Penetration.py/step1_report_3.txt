{
  "purpose": "Define multiple classes for impact and penetration models in structural analysis, including data handling, validation, and calculation functions.",
  "sources": "Data is read from method inputs, class attributes, and external JSON-like structures (e.g., data dictionaries, pickle files, range validation).",
  "sinks": "Methods perform calculations using untrusted input data; no direct data leakage or external communication is evident. No explicit network or file output operations aside from pickle loading.",
  "flows": "Input data sources (e.g., data dictionaries, function arguments) flow into validation, parameter calculations, and modeling functions within classes, with no external data exfiltration or command execution detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Use of global variables (e.g., 'ratio', 'omg') in validation functions could be considered unusual but is not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code, malware-like network activity, or harmful file operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a structured set of classes for impact modeling with multiple formulas and impact simulations. It loads data from pickle files, performs validation, and computes impact criteria. All data processing appears contained within class methods with no external network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious file access. The use of global variables is unconventional but not suspicious. No signs of code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious commands are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of impact calculation models for structural analysis. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The code appears safe and intended solely for impact model computations.",
