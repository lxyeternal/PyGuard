  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of impact modeling classes based on literature formulas, with no malicious or sabotage behavior detected. The primary concern is the use of pickle.load, which is standard but should be used with trusted data. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the analysis and appropriate for this context."
