{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for impact modeling, impact physics calculations, data validation, and serialization, primarily for impact and perforation analysis based on literature formulas.",
  "sources": "Data is read from JSON/dictionary inputs and pickle files; no external network or command execution is involved.",
  "sinks": "Data flows internally within functions; no external data exfiltration, network communication, or system modification detected.",
  "flows": "Data from input dictionaries or pickle files is processed through validation and calculation methods; no external or malicious data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Use of pickle.load is standard but can be risky if untrusted files are loaded; no obfuscation features present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements impact physics formulas from literature, with data validation and serialization routines. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation is evident. Use of global variables is unconventional but not malicious. The pickle.load usage is typical for data loading but warrants caution if used with untrusted files. Overall, the code appears domain-specific, transparent, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of impact modeling classes based on literature formulas, with no malicious or sabotage behavior detected. The primary concern is the use of pickle.load, which is standard but should be used with trusted data. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the analysis and appropriate for this context.",
