  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be intended for general data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input functions or external files (if present), environment variables, or network sources if used within the code.",
  "sinks": "Data could potentially reach output functions, file writes, network connections, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data from sources flows through processing functions to sinks, such as output, network transmission, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs identified. No unusual code patterns, such as dynamic code execution, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with clear control flow. It does not include any suspicious or malicious constructs. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard and justified. No signs of data leakage, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code neither collects nor transmits sensitive data maliciously. No obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or hidden logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears to serve its intended purpose without malicious intent.",
