{
  "purpose": "The code provides a modular framework for extending boto3 clients with additional functionalities, primarily focused on DynamoDB.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.core, .extensions.dynamodb) and module metadata (__version__).",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data flows to external systems, no user input, nor network activity.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code mainly defines classes and exports without data flows or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The provided code appears to be the initial module setup for a Python package, importing core classes and extensions related to boto3 enhancements. It includes package metadata and export definitions. No code performs network communication, executes untrusted input, or manipulates system resources maliciously. The structure is standard for package initialization, with no signs of malicious or maliciously obfuscated content.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initializer for a boto3 extension framework, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and designed solely for modular enhancement of boto3 clients.",
