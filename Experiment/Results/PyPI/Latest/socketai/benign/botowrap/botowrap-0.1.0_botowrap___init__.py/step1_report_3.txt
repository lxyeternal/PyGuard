  "purpose": "Provide a modular framework for extending boto3 clients with enhancements, primarily focusing on DynamoDB.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.core, .extensions.dynamodb)",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only internal module imports and package metadata",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initialization script that declares version info, imports components from local modules, and defines export symbols. It contains no input handling, network activity, or data processing logic. All imported modules are presumably part of the package's functionality and do not appear malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple package metadata and import aggregator with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
