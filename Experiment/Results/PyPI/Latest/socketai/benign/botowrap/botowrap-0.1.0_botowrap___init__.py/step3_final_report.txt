  "purpose": "Initialize the boto3 extension package, providing enhanced DynamoDB client functionality through modular extensions.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.core, .extensions.dynamodb), definition of __version__, and __all__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static package setup with no data flow or external communication.",
  "flows": "Import statements and module exports, with no dynamic or runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initializer, importing core classes and extensions, defining version info, and setting exports. It contains no functions, network activity, or dynamic code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The static analysis and reports uniformly indicate benign, standard code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured package initializer with no malicious or suspicious elements. All assessments and scores are consistent with this conclusion, indicating no security risks or malware.",
