  "purpose": "Provides a modular framework to extend boto3 clients with enhancements, specifically supporting DynamoDB.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.core and .extensions.dynamodb)",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this code; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code mainly defines module imports and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The version string is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as an initialization module for a package, defining its version, importing core and DynamoDB extension components, and exposing public interfaces. No dynamic execution, external data reading, or suspicious constructs are present. It functions as a typical Python package __init__.py file, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initializer with no malicious behavior, no external data sources, and no suspicious patterns. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured Python package setup.",
