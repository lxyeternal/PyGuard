{
  "purpose": "Defines a framework for managing and attaching/detaching extensions to a boto3 AWS session.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing' and 'boto3' modules; class instantiations; method calls like 'boto3.DEFAULT_SESSION'.",
  "sinks": "Methods 'attach' and 'detach' in BaseExtension, called within bootstrap and teardown; potentially untrusted extension objects.",
  "flows": "Extensions are registered and then attached/detached via their methods; session is established at initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code; use of standard boto3 session handling; no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines extension management for AWS boto3 sessions, with methods for registration, attachment, and detachment. The session initialization uses default boto3 session mechanisms. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network communications, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure is straightforward, following standard patterns for extension management. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears safe and normal for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard extension management framework for boto3 sessions with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
