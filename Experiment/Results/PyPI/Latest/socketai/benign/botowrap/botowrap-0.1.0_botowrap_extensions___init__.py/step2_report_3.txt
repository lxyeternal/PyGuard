  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom .dynamodb import DynamoDBConfig, DynamoDBExtension  # noqa: F401\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary of the reports:\n\n- All reports agree that this is a simple import statement.\n- No data processing, network activity, or untrusted data handling is involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The import is from a local module `.dynamodb`, importing classes `DynamoDBConfig` and `DynamoDBExtension`.\n- The comment `# noqa: F401` is used to suppress linter warnings about unused imports, which is common in module setup code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and observations:\n\n- **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n  No, the code is just an import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n  Since there's no malicious activity, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the code's nature.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  No claims are made beyond the observable code; all assessments are accurate.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven all the information, the code snippet is a standard import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores of **malware=0**, **obfuscated=0**, and **securityRisk=0** are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code appears entirely benign and typical for module setup.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores:  \n- **malware:** 0  \n- **obfuscated:** 0  \n- **securityRisk:** 0",
