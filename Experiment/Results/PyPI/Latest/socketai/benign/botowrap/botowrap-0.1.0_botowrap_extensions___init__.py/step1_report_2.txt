  "purpose": "Import DynamoDB configuration and extension classes for use in the module",
  "sources": "Import statement that loads classes from a local module (.dynamodb)",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output occurs in this snippet",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs an import, no data flow or processing",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement with no unusual or suspicious elements",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from a relative module named 'dynamodb'. The import is straightforward, with a comment to ignore unused import warning. There are no signs of data manipulation, dynamic execution, or hidden behavior. It does not involve any input/output, network activity, or credential handling. This appears to be a standard import statement typical in modular Python code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not pose security risks or indicate malicious intent.",
