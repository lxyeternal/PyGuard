  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple import statement importing classes from a local module (`.dynamodb`).\n   - There are no signs of data processing, network activity, or code execution beyond the import.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a security risk of 0, and the code is purely an import statement, a higher risk score would be unjustified.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could compromise security.\n\n5. **Malware Score Analysis:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0.\n   - This is correct; the code contains no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - None of the reports make unwarranted assumptions; they all correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- The code snippet is a standard import statement, typical in Python modules.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Estimated malware score:** 0\n- **Estimated obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Estimated security risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
