{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes DynamoDBConfig and DynamoDBExtension from a local module named dynamodb.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module 'dynamodb'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow is observable in this isolated code.",
  "anomalies": "The code only performs an import with a comment to ignore linting; no suspicious or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward import statement, importing specific classes from a local module. The comment '# noqa: F401' suppresses linter warning about unused imports. There are no hardcoded credentials, external network operations, or malicious constructs. The code fragment is minimal and appears typical for a module setup.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues in this code snippet. It simply imports classes from a local module, which is a common practice in Python projects.",
