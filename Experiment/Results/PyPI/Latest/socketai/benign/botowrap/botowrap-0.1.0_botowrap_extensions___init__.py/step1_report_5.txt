{
  "purpose": "Import DynamoDB configuration and extension classes from a local module, likely for setting up or extending DynamoDB functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module (.dynamodb). No input or data reading beyond import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the code only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. No network, system, or data manipulation activities.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for classes DynamoDBConfig and DynamoDBExtension from a local module. There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing steps. The import does not inherently indicate malicious intent. Given its simplicity and lack of further code, no suspicious activity or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement for configuration classes related to DynamoDB. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be part of a larger, legitimate codebase.",
