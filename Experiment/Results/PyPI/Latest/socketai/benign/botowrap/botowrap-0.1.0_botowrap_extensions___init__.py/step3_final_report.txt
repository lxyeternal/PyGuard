{
  "purpose": "This code imports classes DynamoDBConfig and DynamoDBExtension from a local module named dynamodb, likely for configuration or extension purposes within a larger project.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module '.dynamodb'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present; the code is a static import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is a straightforward import with a linter suppression comment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing specific classes from a local module, with a linter directive to ignore unused import warnings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which are appropriate given the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent, and no modifications to the scores are necessary.",
