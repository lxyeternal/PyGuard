  "purpose": "Unit tests for botowrap core functionality, focusing on extension management and AWS session handling.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports, boto3 session creation, class methods for attach/detach, mock extension instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no external network calls, no data leaks or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of mock extensions -> registration with ExtensionManager -> bootstrap (attach) -> teardown (detach).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward unit tests for extension classes, using standard practices and libraries. No external data flows or malicious behaviors are present. The use of boto3 sessions is typical for AWS SDK interactions. No obfuscation or backdoors are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for testing internal extension management functionality, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
