  "purpose": "Unit tests for DynamoDB extension configuration and initialization, verifying default and custom settings, immutability, and extension setup.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions, class instantiations, pytest assertions, and skipped integration test placeholders.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of configuration objects -> attribute assertions; class initialization -> internal state verification.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward test code with no suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard testing suite for DynamoDB extension configuration, using common libraries and practices. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive operations. All tests are internal and do not involve external data or network communication. The use of moto for mocking AWS services indicates safe testing practices. No vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are justified based on the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured test code with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
