{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for the DynamoDB extension and configuration within a larger application, verifying default and custom configurations, immutability, and initialization correctness.",
  "sources": "The code reads test inputs from function parameters and class instantiations; imports external libraries such as boto3, pytest, and moto.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data output that could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is focused on testing internal configurations and setup.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Tests are straightforward and do not perform any network or file operations outside standard testing frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of unit tests for configuration and extension classes, with no runtime data processing, network calls, or code execution. It imports well-known testing libraries and mocks AWS services using moto for testing. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or dangerous behaviors. The only non-trivial parts are skipped tests that depend on external setup, which do not introduce security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of unit tests for a DynamoDB extension and configuration. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code is safe and solely intended for testing purposes.",
