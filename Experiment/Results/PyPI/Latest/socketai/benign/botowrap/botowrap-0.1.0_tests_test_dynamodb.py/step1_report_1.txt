{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for DynamoDB extension configuration and initialization.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded values for default configuration, custom configuration, and class attributes during tests.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows to vulnerable points; no data leaks or external communication is present.",
  "flows": "The flow is mainly internal: instantiating configuration objects and verifying attribute values; no untrusted data input to output paths.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The tests are straightforward and do not contain malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard set of unit tests verifying default and custom configuration values for a DynamoDB extension. It uses common testing frameworks and mocking for AWS services with 'moto'. No external data handling or security-sensitive operations are present. All code appears to be benign test code with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard testing suite for configuration validation of DynamoDB extension, with no malicious behavior detected. It does not contain security risks or obfuscated code.",
