{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for DynamoDB configuration and extension classes in a Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions, test data, and imported modules; no external input is processed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not perform any data output, network communication, or system modification.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code strictly executes within test functions with hardcoded values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises unit tests that validate default and custom configurations for DynamoDB settings. It uses standard testing frameworks (pytest), and mocks external dependencies with moto. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks are involved. The tests are straightforward and only validate class behavior. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, standard testing suite for DynamoDB extension classes. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
