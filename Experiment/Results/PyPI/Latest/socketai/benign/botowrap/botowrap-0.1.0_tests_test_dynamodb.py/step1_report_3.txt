{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for DynamoDB extension configurations and initialization.",
  "sources": "Imports boto3, pytest, moto, and local modules; uses class instantiations and assertions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; tests primarily involve object creation and attribute checks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only internal attribute access and assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. Tests are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "Code performs typical unit tests for configuration and extension initialization. It uses moto for mocking AWS services but the actual test methods are skipped, indicating no active network or data operations. No obfuscated code, malicious payload, or suspicious logic detected. The code appears safe and standard for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of unit tests for a DynamoDB extension, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
