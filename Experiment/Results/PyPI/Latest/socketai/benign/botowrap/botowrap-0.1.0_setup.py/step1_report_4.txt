  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'botowrap' Python package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading version from '__init__.py', reading 'README.md', and package data inclusion.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data directly affects system state or leaks occur.",
  "flows": "Version extraction from source file to package setup configuration; reading long description; package data inclusion.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code follows standard setup conventions. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads the package version from '__init__.py' to prevent duplication errors. It reads a Markdown README for long description. Uses 'setuptools' for packaging, specifies dependencies and optional dev requirements, and includes metadata. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behavior observed. The structure and content are consistent with a typical Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
