{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for packaging and distributing the 'botowrap' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading version from '__init__.py', reading 'README.md', package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Reading version -> setup() parameters; reading long_description -> setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the package version from the '__init__.py' file, reads a README for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. All operations are standard for Python package setup. No data from untrusted sources, no network connections, and no executable code beyond standard package configuration. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It simply defines the package's metadata and dependencies.",
