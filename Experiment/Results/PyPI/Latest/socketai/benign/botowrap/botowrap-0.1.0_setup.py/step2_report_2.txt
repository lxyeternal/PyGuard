  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, network activity, or inclusion of malicious payloads. The code reads static files and passes data into the `setup()` function, which is typical.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic or Reasoning:**  \n   The reports correctly identify that the script is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices. No logical flaws or security issues are evident in the code itself.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.  \n   - **Risk Score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the script.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify that the script is a typical setup configuration with no malicious intent.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. Since there's no malicious or suspicious activity, scores of zero are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (code is straightforward)  \n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Comments:\n\nGiven the comprehensive analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The setup script is standard, secure, and free from any malicious or obfuscated code. No further action or increased risk scoring is warranted.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a legitimate, well-structured Python package setup script with no signs of malware or security issues.",
