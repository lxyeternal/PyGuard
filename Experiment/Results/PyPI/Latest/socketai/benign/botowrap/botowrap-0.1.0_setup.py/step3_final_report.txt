  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'botowrap', handling version extraction, description, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version from 'botowrap/__init__.py' and README.md; static data passed to setuptools.setup()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input or external data handling beyond static file reads",
  "flows": "Static file reads to variables, then data passed directly into setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, static code with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads version info and description files, then calls setuptools.setup() with static, controlled data. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. Dependencies are standard and explicitly declared. The absence of untrusted input, obfuscation, or malicious code indicates a benign package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign package setup file with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are consistent with this analysis.",
