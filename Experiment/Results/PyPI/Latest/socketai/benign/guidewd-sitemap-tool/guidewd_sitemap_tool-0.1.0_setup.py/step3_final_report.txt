  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration defining metadata, dependencies, entry points, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields, dependencies list, entry_points dict, and README.md file read operation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup parameters are static.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholder email and URL, but these are common in template code and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It uses static metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The entry point is standard for CLI tools and does not indicate malicious intent. Placeholders for email and URL are benign and should be updated before release but do not pose security risks. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The placeholders are typical in template code and do not indicate malicious activity. The entry point pattern is standard for CLI tools. Overall, the package poses no security risks.",
