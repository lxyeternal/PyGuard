  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'guidewd-sitemap-tool' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'setuptools', package metadata fields, external dependencies listed in 'install_requires', and reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'setup()' function, reading of external 'README.md' file.",
  "flows": "Import and dependency declaration flow, package configuration flow, reading external file flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a placeholder email 'your-email@example.com' and URL 'https://github.com/yourusername/guidewd-sitemap-seo-tool', which may indicate incomplete or placeholder information but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for package configuration. It specifies package name, version, dependencies, entry points, classifiers, author info, description, and reads a README file for long description. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The placeholder email and URL are not malicious but suggest incomplete configuration. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a typical package configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It lacks any suspicious code or malicious payloads.",
