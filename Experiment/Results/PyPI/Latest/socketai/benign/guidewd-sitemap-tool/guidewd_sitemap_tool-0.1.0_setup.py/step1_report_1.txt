{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'guidewd-sitemap-tool' including dependencies, entry points, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Read input from 'README.md' for long_description, user-provided package metadata (author_email, url).",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or transmits untrusted data; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup configuration primarily reads static or user-defined metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Commented placeholders ('your-email@example.com', URL) indicating possible incomplete setup; no suspicious or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package info, dependencies, entry points, and classifiers. The only dynamic operation is reading the README.md file for long_description, which is a common practice. No user input, environment variables, or external data is processed or transmitted. The placeholders for author email and URL suggest incomplete configuration but do not indicate malicious intent. The code does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs, nor any malicious behaviors such as network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate package setup script with no malicious or security risk indicators. The placeholders should be replaced with valid data before deployment, but they do not represent security issues.",
