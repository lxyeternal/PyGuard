{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'guidewd-sitemap-tool' package, configuring metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Package name, version, dependencies, author info, URL, and long description from README.md.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the 'long_description' reads from a file, but this is standard; no untrusted input handling in this context.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The setup is static, based on predefined metadata and file reads.",
  "anomalies": "The 'author_email' and 'url' fields contain placeholder comments suggesting manual editing; no dynamic or malicious code present. No suspicious or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script using setuptools to package a project. It reads a static README.md for the long description, defines dependencies, and specifies entry points. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are processed at runtime. The placeholders for 'author_email' and 'url' are benign and intended for manual update. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
