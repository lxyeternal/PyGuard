  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'guidewd-sitemap-tool' including dependencies, entry points, and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata, dependencies, and reads the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted input are present. No network or sensitive data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily loads static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "Author email and URL fields contain placeholder comments indicating they should be replaced, but no malicious or suspicious code present. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It imports 'setuptools' functions, defines package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and reads a README file for the long description. No code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The placeholder comments for author email and URL are typical in template code and do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate package setup code with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No anomalies or suspicious activity are present.",
