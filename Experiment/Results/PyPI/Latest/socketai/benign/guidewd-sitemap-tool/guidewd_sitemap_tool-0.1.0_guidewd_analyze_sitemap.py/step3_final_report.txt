  "purpose": "Analyze a sitemap XML file, fetch each URL, extract meta tags (title, description, keywords), and generate SEO suggestions based on character length.",
  "sources": "XML sitemap file for URLs, HTTP GET requests to each URL, HTML meta tags (title, description, keywords) in fetched pages.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, parsing HTML content, generating suggestions; no data leaks or destructive actions detected.",
  "flows": "XML parsing of sitemap -> URL fetching via requests.get() -> HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup -> meta data extraction -> suggestion generation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Error handling for requests is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard sitemap parsing, URL fetching, and HTML meta extraction for SEO purposes. External requests are handled with basic error handling, and no malicious or obfuscated code is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the script. The minimal security risk stems from external web requests, which are typical for such tools and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SEO analysis utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The low security risk score is justified given the external requests, but overall, the code is safe and transparent.",
