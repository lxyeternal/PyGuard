  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a version string to a variable in an __init__.py file. There are no inputs, no outputs, no external calls, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. The content appears typical for a package initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard boilerplate for a Python package's __init__.py with no malicious intent or security risks.",
