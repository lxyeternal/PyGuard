{
  "purpose": "This code defines a package version string in a standard __init__.py file, serving as metadata for the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns a static string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or produce outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the assignment is static and does not involve untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no unusual constructs, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a version string in a package's __init__.py. It contains no input/output, no dynamic code, no external calls, and no obfuscation. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, which is appropriate given its benign nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), and there are no anomalies or suspicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign boilerplate with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are consistent with its simplicity and purpose.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
