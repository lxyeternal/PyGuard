  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code solely consists of static string definitions used for help messages and error reporting.\n   - The use of `dedent` is for formatting multi-line strings, not for executing code or handling untrusted data.\n   - There are no functions, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, nor any external input handling.\n\n2. **Potential Malicious or Security Risks**:\n   - The reports consistently state there are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The strings are documentation or error messages, with no embedded secrets, credentials, or network activity.\n   - No suspicious patterns, code injection points, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n   - The overall confidence is 1, which aligns with the thorough, static analysis.\n\n4. **Any Inconsistencies or Unreasonable Scores?**\n   - No. The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No report suggests any reason to assign higher scores for malware or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions & Claims**:\n   - The reports correctly challenge any assumptions of malicious intent, as the code is purely static documentation strings.\n   - No evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities based on the provided code.\n\n6. **Overall Security Assessment**:\n   - The code is benign, static, and safe.\n   - No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain at **0**.\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is purely static documentation and error message strings with no security concerns. All scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
