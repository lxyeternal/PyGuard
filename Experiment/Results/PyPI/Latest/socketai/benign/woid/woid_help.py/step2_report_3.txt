  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Obfuscated Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static string definitions, formatted help, and error messages.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious payloads.\n   - The use of `dedent` is standard for formatting multi-line strings and does not introduce security concerns.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that the code is purely informational.\n   - No report claims or implies any malicious intent or security vulnerability beyond static documentation.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the content.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty.\n   - No adjustments are necessary for the scores; they align well with the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - Since the code is static and only contains documentation strings, any claims of vulnerabilities would be unfounded.\n   - The reports correctly challenge any assumptions that static strings could be malicious—they are not.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The reports are consistent with each other and with the code's nature.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign and serves as documentation or static configuration help.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n- Given the code's purpose—static help and error message strings—there's no reason to assign any higher scores.\n- The code's structure and content are straightforward, with no hidden or malicious logic.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. The code is benign, static documentation strings with no security implications. The scores reflect this correctly.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
