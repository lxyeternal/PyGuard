  "purpose": "Define and provide help and error message strings related to JSON configuration for hosts and projects.",
  "sources": "String assignments within HelpStrings.JsonFields and ErrorStrings classes; dedent function processing string literals.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data input or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static string assignments are safe.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. Usage of dedent is standard for formatting multi-line strings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static help and error message strings with proper formatting. No external input handling, no code execution, no dynamic behavior, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns. The structure is straightforward, and all string contents are static documentation or error messages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be purely for documentation and error messaging purposes with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains no obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
