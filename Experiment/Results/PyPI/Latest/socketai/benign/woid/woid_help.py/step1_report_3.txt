  "purpose": "Define descriptive help and error message strings for JSON fields and errors related to project host URLs and workspace JSON parsing.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments within class attributes, specifically the dedent() calls providing help text.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling, input/output operations, or data processing is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only initializes static strings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. Usage of dedent() is for formatting help messages, not code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions with static string attributes containing help and error messages. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, nor any data handling that could be exploited. The strings are plain documentation-like messages meant for user guidance. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, only providing static help text and error message strings with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
