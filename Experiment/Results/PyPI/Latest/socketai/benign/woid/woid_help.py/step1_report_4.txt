  "purpose": "Provides documentation strings for JSON field descriptions related to host URLs and project hosts, as well as an error message string.",
  "sources": "String definitions within HelpStrings.JsonFields and ErrorStrings classes.",
  "sinks": "No sink points where untrusted data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only contains static string definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static, hardcoded documentation strings with no dynamic input, no data processing, no external calls, and no executable logic beyond string assignments. It uses dedent for formatting but does not include any potentially malicious operations. No credentials, network activity, or external data handling is present. The code appears purely informational and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is non-malicious, consisting solely of static documentation strings for JSON fields and an error message. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
