  "purpose": "Provide help and error message strings related to JSON configuration of host URLs and projects.",
  "sources": "String literals containing help instructions and error messages",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external input/output handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code only defines constants",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward definitions of static strings",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two classes with nested classes, defining static help strings and an error message. No functions, no input handling, no data processing, no dynamic execution. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No external data sources, no network operations, no credential handling. The strings contain documentation for host URLs and project structure, which appear benign and intended for user guidance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple static definition of help and error message strings with no malicious intent or security risks.",
