  "purpose": "Static help and error message strings intended for documentation or user guidance.",
  "sources": "Defined as class string attributes, no data input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external output.",
  "flows": "N/A; static strings only, no data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static, well-formatted multi-line strings with no obfuscation or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string definitions within classes, formatted with dedent for readability. There is no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. The strings serve as help or error messages, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. The high confidence score (1) is justified given the static, straightforward content. No logical flaws or security concerns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely static documentation strings with no malicious or security risk. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
