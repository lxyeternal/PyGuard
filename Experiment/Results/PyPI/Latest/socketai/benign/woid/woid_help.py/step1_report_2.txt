  "purpose": "Provide descriptive help and error message strings related to JSON configuration of project hosts and URLs.",
  "sources": "Constants defining multi-line help strings using dedent, reading from class attributes",
  "sinks": "No direct sink that executes or processes untrusted data; only static strings are defined",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations; static help/error messages are isolated",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets or credentials",
  "analysis": "The code defines static help and error message strings within class attributes. It uses 'dedent' to format multi-line strings. There are no functions, no input handling, no external data processing, and no dynamic code execution. The code serves as documentation or static constants and poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be safe, purely defining static help and error messages without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
