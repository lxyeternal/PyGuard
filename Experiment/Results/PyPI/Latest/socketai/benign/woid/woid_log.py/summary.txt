  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented logging utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The slight security risk score reflects minimal concerns related to potential misuse of logs or abrupt termination, but these are not inherent vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in production environments."
