{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a structured logging system with custom console output formatting, including functions for different log levels and JSON serialization.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries (logging, sys, functools, json, typing), external libraries (structlog, rich). No input sources such as user input or external data sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "Logging functions (dbg, inf, wrn, err, fatal) output to the console via structlog and rich; json_dumps outputs a JSON string.",
  "flows": "Logging functions call get_logger(), which configures structlog and ultimately calls _console_printer for console output. json_dumps serializes data for output or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. The _console_printer function formats logs with no external data dependencies. The use of cache on get_logger() is typical for performance. No obfuscated or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily configures structured logging with customizable console output. It uses standard libraries and well-known external packages without apparent malicious modifications. The logging functions are straightforward wrappers. No suspicious data flows, external network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The json_dumps function simply serializes data with custom formatting, no risky code involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign logging utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or external data exfiltration. Its design is typical for application logging setups.",
