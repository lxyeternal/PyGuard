  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided, as the code is missing from the input.",
  "sources": "Since no code is provided, there are no identifiable sources where the code reads input or data.",
  "sinks": "Without actual code, there are no identified sinks where untrusted data could lead to leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows can be established due to the absence of code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without code; the input appears empty, thus no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior is detectable.",
  "analysis": "There is no code present to analyze. Therefore, no sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies can be identified. The lack of code prevents any meaningful security assessment.",
  "conclusion": "No code was provided for review. Based on the absence of code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The overall security posture cannot be assessed.",
