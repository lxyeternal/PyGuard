  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the implementation of a Python package, likely for general use, without any immediately apparent malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Data is read from user inputs, environment variables, or external modules. Specific source points are not explicitly shown in the code provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, or subprocess calls, but no explicit dangerous sinks are identified from the provided code fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network or filesystem operations. No explicit source-to-sink path is evident in the code snippet provided.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code features are detected. The code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "A detailed line-by-line review shows standard Python constructs. No signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. Third-party libraries are used normally, and no suspicious patterns such as dynamic execution or data exfiltration mechanisms are observed. The absence of evident sources and sinks suggests no malicious activities or security risks are apparent in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign implementation, with no indications of malware, malicious data flows, or security vulnerabilities within the provided code segment.",
