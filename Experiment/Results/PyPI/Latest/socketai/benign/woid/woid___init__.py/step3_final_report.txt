  "purpose": "Assessment of open source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets and descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data from package code, environment variables, network or file operations, user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources feeding into sinks via code logic, such as reading environment variables and sending data over network.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All provided reports indicate either benign code or absence of code. The reports correctly assign malware scores of 0 where no malicious activity is detected, and low security risk scores (~0.2) for benign data processing. Confidence levels align with the amount of information; high confidence when code is present and benign, full confidence (1) when code is absent. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified. The scores are consistent and justified based on the descriptions and code states.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears safe with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent across reports. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
