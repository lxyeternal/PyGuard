      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured configuration parser with thorough validation and error handling. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score is justified, primarily related to potential data exposure in logs, but not a real security threat."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented logging utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The slight security risk score reflects minimal concerns related to potential misuse of logs or abrupt termination, but these are not inherent vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in production environments."
