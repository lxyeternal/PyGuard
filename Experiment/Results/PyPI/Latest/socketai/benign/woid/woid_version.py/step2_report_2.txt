  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or logic that could be malicious. The code is benign and minimal.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They uniformly conclude that the code is harmless, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `obfuscated`: 0  \n   - `malware`: 0  \n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   \n   These are appropriate given the code's simplicity. Since the code is just a version string assignment, these scores seem reasonable. No changes are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is merely a version string assignment with no external interactions or logic, a high risk score is unwarranted. The current score of 0 for `malware` and `securityRisk` is justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate. There is no indication of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment**:  \nGiven the simplicity of the code, I agree with the provided scores:  \n- `obfuscated`: 0  \n- `malware`: 0  \n- `securityRisk`: 0\n\n**My Final Estimate**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis code fragment is entirely benign and poses no security threat.",
