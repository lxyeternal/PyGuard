  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the __version__ variable in a Python module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows; there are no sinks that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single line assigning a version string to __version__, a common practice for module metadata. It contains no input/output, external calls, or logic that could be malicious. The code is benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature and assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and standard pattern of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a version indicator with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
