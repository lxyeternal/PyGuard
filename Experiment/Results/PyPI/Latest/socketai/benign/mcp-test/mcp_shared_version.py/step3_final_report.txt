  "purpose": "Define supported protocol versions using a static integer and an imported version constant.",
  "sources": "Import of LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION from mcp.types",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved",
  "flows": "Import of version constant to tuple assignment",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and constant definition",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version constant and assigns a tuple with a static integer and the imported version. No dynamic execution, user input, or network activity. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The code is a simple configuration snippet with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and serves as a configuration for supported protocol versions. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
