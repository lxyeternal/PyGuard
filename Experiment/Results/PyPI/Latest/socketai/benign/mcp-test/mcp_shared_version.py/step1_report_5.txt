  "purpose": "Define supported protocol versions using a constant integer and a dynamically imported value",
  "sources": "Import statement: from mcp.types import LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only constant definitions",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; just assignment of constants",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a constant LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION from an external module and assigns a tuple containing an integer and that constant to SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The import appears standard, and the assignment is straightforward. No external data is processed, and no dynamic code execution is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, standard, and appears benign with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
