  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the original code, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The original code is straightforward:\n  ```python\n  from mcp.types import LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION\n\n  SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS: tuple[int, str] = (1, LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION)\n  ```\n- It imports a version constant and defines a tuple with an integer and that imported value.\n- No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n\n**Step 2: Review each report**\n\nAll reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and serves as a configuration for supported protocol versions. They uniformly state no anomalies, malicious activity, or obfuscation.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the reasoning and scores**\n\n- **Malware Score (0):** All reports assign zero, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score (0):** Correct, no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security Risk (0.1):** Slightly above zero, possibly reflecting minimal concern for future misconfigurations or assumptions, but given the code's simplicity, this seems marginal.\n- **Confidence (1):** Justified, as all analyses agree.\n\n**Step 4: Check for any overlooked issues**\n\n- Is there any hidden malicious intent? No.\n- Could the imported `LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION` be malicious? Unlikely, as it's imported from a module, and there's no evidence of tampering.\n- Are the scores consistent? Yes, all reports agree.\n\n**Step 5: Final assessment**\n\nGiven the code's simplicity and the analyses, the scores seem appropriate. The only minor point is the `securityRisk` being 0.1—since there's no actual risk, perhaps it should be 0, but this is a minor subjective choice.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk present)\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\nI concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. If anything, the `securityRisk` could be lowered to 0 for accuracy, but 0.1 is acceptable as a conservative default.\n\n---\n\n**Overall, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's simplicity and the comprehensive analysis provided.",
