  "purpose": "Define supported protocol versions using a constant tuple, referencing an imported value.",
  "sources": "Import statement from mcp.types, reading the constant LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The import flows into the SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS assignment, referencing the imported constant.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a constant value from a module and uses it to define a tuple of supported protocol versions. The import appears straightforward and secure. The tuple includes an integer and the imported version string. No user input, environment variables, or external data are involved. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign configuration snippet setting supported protocol versions. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
