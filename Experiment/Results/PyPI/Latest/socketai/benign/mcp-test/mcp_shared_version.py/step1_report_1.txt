  "purpose": "Define supported protocol versions using a constant and a value imported from another module.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from mcp.types import LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks; the code only sets a constant.",
  "flows": "Import source provides data used to define 'SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, importing a version string/number and defining a tuple.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a value representing the latest protocol version from a module named 'mcp.types'. It then defines a tuple 'SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS' containing an integer (1) and the imported version. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a simple configuration or constant setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic configuration snippet that defines supported protocol versions. It performs no malicious actions or security risks. There are no signs of malware or suspicious activity.",
