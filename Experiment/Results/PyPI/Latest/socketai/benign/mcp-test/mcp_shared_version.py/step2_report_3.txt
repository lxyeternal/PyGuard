  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the corresponding code snippet.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same pattern: importing `LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION` from `mcp.types` and defining a tuple `SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS` with a static integer and the imported value.\n- No reports identify any actual issues, anomalies, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code appears to be straightforward configuration, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is syntactically correct and logically consistent.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None apparent; the code is a simple constant definition.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low (0.1 or 0), which seems reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n### Justification:\n- The code is a static configuration snippet.\n- No data leaks, no external inputs, no dynamic code execution.\n- The import is from a presumably trusted internal module.\n- No suspicious patterns or anomalies.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- The reports correctly identify the purpose and nature of the code.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Overall malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (since it's a configuration snippet, minimal risk)\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code is benign, with no security concerns. The minimal risk score reflects the configuration purpose, not any vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No changes to scores are necessary.",
