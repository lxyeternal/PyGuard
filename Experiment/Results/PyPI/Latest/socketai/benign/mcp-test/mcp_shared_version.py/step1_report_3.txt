{
  "purpose": "Define supported protocol versions using a constant tuple with a hardcoded integer and a value imported from another module.",
  "sources": "Importing 'LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION' from 'mcp.types'. The tuple 'SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS' is initialized with a static integer and the imported value.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external outputs are present; the code does not utilize user input or external data sources.",
  "flows": "The code assigns a tuple containing a constant and an imported value; no data flows from external or untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, defining constants and importing a value.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a constant 'LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION' from a module and defines a tuple 'SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS' with a static integer and the imported version. There is no evidence of data processing, dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior. The structure is standard for version management in software. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears to serve a benign purpose of defining supported protocol versions. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
