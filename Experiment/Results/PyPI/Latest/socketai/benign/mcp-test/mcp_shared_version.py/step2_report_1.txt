  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is straightforward, importing a version constant and defining a tuple. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data leaks. The code appears benign and serves a configuration purpose.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is simple, import-based, and does not perform any suspicious operations. No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   - *Obfuscated*: All reports assign 0, which seems appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n   - *Malware*: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.  \n   - *Security Risk*: Mostly 0.1 or 0, reflecting minimal or no risk. Given the code's benign nature, a score of 0.1 might be slightly high but still acceptable as a conservative estimate.  \n\n   Since the code is purely configuration, these scores seem reasonable. No adjustments are necessary unless we want to be more conservative, but the current scores are justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.1, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any operations that could pose a security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification**:  \n   All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code imports a version constant and defines a tuple; there's no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions about Vulnerabilities**:  \n   The reports assume the code is benign based on its simplicity. This is reasonable. No hidden or dynamic behavior is present. The assumption that importing a version constant is safe is justified.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 (acceptable, given the minimal risk and benign nature)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nThe code is a simple configuration snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified. No further action or adjustment is necessary.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0.1\n\nThese reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
