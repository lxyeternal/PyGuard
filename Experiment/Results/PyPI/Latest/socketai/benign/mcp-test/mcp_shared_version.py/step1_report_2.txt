  "purpose": "Define supported protocol versions using a constant and a variable.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION from mcp.types module.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of tuple containing integers and string to SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS.",
  "flows": "Import statement to variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports. Usage of a version constant appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version constant from an external module and defines a tuple that includes a hardcoded integer and this imported value. The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as secret leaks or backdoors. It appears to be standard version support code.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet appears to be benign, merely setting supported protocol versions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
