  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code step-by-step.\n\n**1. Code Review and Issue Confirmation:**\n\n- The code simply imports a constant `LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION` from `mcp.types` and defines a tuple `SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS` with an integer `1` and the imported version.\n- No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or external data processing are present.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward configuration snippet for supported protocol versions.\n\n**2. Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious behavior.\n- They correctly identify that the code is merely defining constants and importing a version string/number.\n- No report claims or implies any suspicious or malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws.\n\n**3. Score Evaluations and Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign `0`. The code is clear and simple, with no signs of obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign very low or zero, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n**4. Potential Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n**5. Critical Observations and Challenges:**\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is sound.\n- The only minor point is that the `securityRisk` score is 0.1 in some reports, possibly reflecting a very minimal risk due to the import, but this is reasonable given the context.\n\n**6. Final Assessment and Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**7. Overall Confidence:**\n\n- The collective analysis is thorough and consistent.\n- The code is straightforward, with no hidden issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n- The code is a simple, benign configuration snippet.\n- All scores assigned are appropriate.\n- No further action or concern is warranted based on this code.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| **0** | **0** | **0** |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
