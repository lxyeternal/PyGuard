      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, structural module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and should be maintained at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a minimal risk score of 0.1 being acceptable if retained, though zero is also justified."

      "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive, schema-only implementation of MCP protocol messages, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or executable logic. It is safe for use in protocol implementations. The minimal risk score (0.1) reflects the potential for untrusted data in schema fields, but overall, the code is benign."

      "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their scoring. Report 1's high scores are justified by malicious indicators. Reports 2-4 are benign with appropriate low scores. Report 5's suspicion warrants a higher malware score. Overall, the assessments are reasonable and align with the described behaviors."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of progress tracking with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk is justified by the network communication, which is typical for such mechanisms. No modifications are necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup for in-memory client-server testing within the MCP framework. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is minimal. The only correction needed is to fix the resource management syntax. Overall, the reports accurately assess the code's safety and purpose."

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate CLI tool with dynamic plugin loading and subprocess execution, exhibiting no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The primary security concern is the potential for exploitation if user inputs are untrusted, but current safeguards are reasonable. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3) due to the inherent risks of dynamic code execution and subprocess handling."
