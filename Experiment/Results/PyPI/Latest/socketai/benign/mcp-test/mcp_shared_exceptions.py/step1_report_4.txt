{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling MCP connection errors, encapsulating ErrorData.",
  "sources": "Import statement from mcp.types and the constructor parameter 'error'.",
  "sinks": "The exception message passed to the superclass constructor, which is error.message.",
  "flows": "ErrorData object passed into McpError constructor -> super().__init__(error.message) -> exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard class and exception pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward custom exception class 'McpError' that inherits from Exception. It takes an 'ErrorData' object during initialization, then passes its 'message' attribute to the base Exception class. There are no external data flows, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The import statement is from a local or package module 'mcp.types', and the class is well-structured without any evident security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of a custom exception class for MCP connection errors. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
