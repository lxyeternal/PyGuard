{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors received over an MCP connection.",
  "sources": "The class imports ErrorData from mcp.types and takes an ErrorData instance as input during initialization.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data directly; the exception is raised with error.message but does not perform any dangerous operations with it.",
  "flows": "ErrorData instance is passed to the constructor and stored in self.error; used in super().__init__(error.message) to initialize the Exception base class.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard class definition for custom exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class that inherits from Exception. It imports ErrorData, which is likely a data structure describing error details. The constructor initializes the parent Exception with error.message and stores the entire ErrorData object. No dynamic execution, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The use of ErrorData suggests structured error handling, but there are no signs of malicious or suspicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or data leaks are present. The code appears to be straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a simple, standard custom exception class for MCP errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a typical pattern for structured error handling.",
