{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors received over an MCP connection.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'mcp.types' module, usage of 'ErrorData' class, constructor parameter 'error'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks are present.",
  "flows": "ErrorData instance passed to constructor is stored in the exception object and its message is used in the superclass; no external data flow to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard class definition and exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class 'ErrorData' and defines a subclass of Exception 'McpError' that encapsulates an 'ErrorData' instance. The constructor initializes the exception with the message from 'ErrorData' and stores the entire object. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. No external network or data leak points are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for custom exception definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple, legitimate custom exception class for error handling in an MCP protocol context. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks in this snippet.",
