  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Logical Consistency:**\n   - The code defines a custom exception class `McpError` that inherits from `Exception`.\n   - It imports `ErrorData` from `mcp.types`.\n   - The constructor takes an `ErrorData` object, calls the superclass constructor with `error.message`, and stores the entire `ErrorData` object in `self.error`.\n   - The implementation is straightforward, standard for custom exceptions, and aligns with typical Python practices.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code does not contain any anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No external network calls, file operations, or data leaks are evident.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The data flow is internal, with the `ErrorData` object being stored and its message used for exception messaging.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, benign, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a simple custom exception class with no security risks.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0, as the code does not introduce security vulnerabilities or risks.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume `ErrorData` is a benign data structure, which seems reasonable given the context.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are made, and the code appears to serve its purpose safely.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment & Personal Estimate:**\n   - The code is a typical pattern for custom exceptions.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n   - The scores provided are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured custom exception class for handling MCP errors. The reports correctly identify its benign nature. No modifications or increased risk scores are warranted.",
