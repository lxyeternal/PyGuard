  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code defines a custom exception class `McpError` that inherits from `Exception`.\n- It imports `ErrorData` from `mcp.types`.\n- The constructor takes an `ErrorData` object, passes its `message` attribute to the base class, and stores the entire `ErrorData` object in `self.error`.\n\n**Review of Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard, and benign.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated behavior is identified.\n- The data flow is limited to passing an `ErrorData` object and its message.\n- No external network, file operations, or data leaks are present.\n- The import and usage patterns are typical for structured error handling.\n\n**Assessment of Security Risks:**\n- The code is a simple exception wrapper; it does not process untrusted data beyond storing and passing the error message.\n- The `ErrorData` class is imported but not detailed here; assuming it is a data structure for error info, not malicious code.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident.\n- The consistent \"malware\" score of 0 across reports aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation present.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 — standard exception handling with no vulnerabilities.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- Since all reports agree on the benign nature, no score adjustments are necessary.\n- The pattern is typical and safe; no hidden issues are apparent.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The code is appropriate as-is.\n- The scores assigned (obfuscated: 0, malware: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified and should remain.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is a straightforward, safe, and standard implementation of a custom exception class for error handling in an MCP context.",
