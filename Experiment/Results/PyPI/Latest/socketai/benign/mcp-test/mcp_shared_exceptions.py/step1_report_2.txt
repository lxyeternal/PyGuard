{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for errors received over an MCP connection, encapsulating ErrorData.",
  "sources": "Import from mcp.types, constructor parameter 'error' of type ErrorData.",
  "sinks": "super().__init__(error.message) uses the error message, but this is standard exception handling and not a sink for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "ErrorData is passed into the constructor, stored in self.error, and its message used in the parent Exception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code behavior, no obfuscated code or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward custom exception class that extends Exception, encapsulating an ErrorData object. It uses the message property of ErrorData for exception messaging. There are no external data inputs beyond the constructor parameter, which is type-annotated. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling observed. The import from mcp.types appears standard and expected in a modular package structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, well-structured custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
