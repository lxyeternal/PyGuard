  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it to the original code to verify accuracy, consistency, and potential issues.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines a class `McpError` inheriting from `Exception`.\n- It imports `ErrorData` from `mcp.types`.\n- The constructor takes an `ErrorData` object, calls `super().__init__(error.message)`, and stores the entire `ErrorData` in `self.error`.\n- The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data leaks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. The code is a standard custom exception class.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, or security risks:** All reports correctly identify that there are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Data flow and sinks:** The data flows are internal, with no external or untrusted sinks involved.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities are evident; the code handles structured error data safely.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points on the reports:\n- **Purpose & sources:** All reports correctly identify the purpose and sources.\n- **Sinks & flows:** All reports correctly note that the data is only used internally and passed to the base exception.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** All reports agree that this is a standard, benign implementation.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Confidence:** All reports have confidence 1, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All report 0, correct.\n- **Malware:** All report 0, correct.\n- **Security risk:** All report 0, correct.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent.\n- No modifications are needed based on the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a straightforward, standard custom exception class with no security concerns.\n\n**Therefore, I assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current reports and the code's nature.",
