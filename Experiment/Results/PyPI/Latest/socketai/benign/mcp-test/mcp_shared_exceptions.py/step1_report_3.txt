{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for errors received over an MCP connection, encapsulating ErrorData.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'mcp.types' module; ErrorData object passed during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data output or external system interaction within this snippet.",
  "flows": "ErrorData instance passed to constructor -> stored in self.error -> used as message in super().__init__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code structure is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports ErrorData type, defines an exception class that holds an ErrorData instance, and initializes the exception with error.message. It is a standard pattern for custom exceptions. No external network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution detected. No obfuscation or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard implementation of a custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
