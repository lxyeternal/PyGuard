  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Review and Logic Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines a class `McpError` inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - It imports `ErrorData` from `mcp.types`.\n   - The constructor takes an `ErrorData` object, passes its `message` attribute to the base `Exception`, and stores the entire `ErrorData` in `self.error`.\n   - The code is straightforward, standard for custom exception classes, with no external data flows, network calls, or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Assessment of Potential Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data beyond storing and passing the message.\n   - The import and usage are standard, with no signs of code injection or malicious logic.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Malware score:** All reports indicate 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - **Security risk score:** All reports give 0, which is justified given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The only potential concern could be if `ErrorData` itself is malicious or contains malicious payloads. However, this is outside the scope of this snippet and depends on the implementation of `ErrorData`.\n   - Since the code only accesses `error.message`, which is a string, and stores the entire object, there is no evidence of malicious behavior here.\n\n5. **Conclusion and Recommendations:**\n   - The code is a standard, safe implementation of a custom exception class.\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate.\n   - No changes are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n**Final personal assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet appears entirely benign and well-structured for its purpose.",
