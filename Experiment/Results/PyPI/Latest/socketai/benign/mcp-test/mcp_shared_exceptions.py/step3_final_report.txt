{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class 'McpError' that encapsulates 'ErrorData' for MCP connection errors.",
  "sources": "ErrorData object passed to the constructor, specifically 'error.message' used in Exception message.",
  "sinks": "The 'error.message' string used as the exception message; stored in 'self.error' for internal reference.",
  "flows": "Input 'ErrorData' flows from constructor parameter to exception message and internal storage.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns detected; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard custom exception 'McpError' that inherits from 'Exception'. It imports 'ErrorData' and initializes with an 'ErrorData' instance, passing its 'message' attribute to the base class and storing the entire object. No external data flows, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is simple, well-structured, and free of security issues or malicious intent. All reports concur on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's purpose is to encapsulate error information safely; no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe, and standard implementation of a custom exception class for MCP errors. It poses no security risks, contains no obfuscation, and does not exhibit malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
