{
  "purpose": "This code manages progress tracking within a request context, providing an async method to update progress notifications and a context manager for easy handling.",
  "sources": "Reading context data: ctx.meta.progressToken, ctx.session; Input parameters: total, amount",
  "sinks": "session.send_progress_notification method, which sends progress updates potentially over a network",
  "flows": "ProgressContext.progress method receives an amount, updates current, and calls session.send_progress_notification with progress token, current, and total",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a few external modules, defines data structures, and provides methods for progress tracking. It reads progress tokens from request context metadata and updates progress via an asynchronous method that calls a session method to send notifications. The context manager handles resource management but does not perform any malicious actions. No data leaks, code injections, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be straightforward and well-structured for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for managing progress notifications within a request context, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external session methods to send updates, which should be reviewed separately for security concerns.",
