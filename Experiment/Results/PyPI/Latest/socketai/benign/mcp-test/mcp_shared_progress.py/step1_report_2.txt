{
  "purpose": "The code defines a progress tracking mechanism within an asynchronous context, managing progress updates and notifications during a session.",
  "sources": "Reads data from context objects (ctx.meta, ctx.session) and method parameters (total, progress amounts).",
  "sinks": "Calls to session.send_progress_notification, which could potentially send data over a network.",
  "flows": "ProgressContext.progress() reads current progress, updates it, then calls session.send_progress_notification to send updates. The context manager yields ProgressContext for progress updates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious variable names. No external input parsing or unsafe code execution observed. Usage of standard libraries and patterns is typical. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code manages progress updates within an asynchronous context, utilizing a context manager and a data class for state management. It depends on external session objects to send progress notifications, which is a common pattern. The use of context variables and data flow appears straightforward. No suspicious data handling, network activity, or malicious logic such as data exfiltration or backdoors is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of progress notification handling in an async environment, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily manages internal state and communicates progress updates securely through provided session methods.",
