  "purpose": "Provides progress tracking and notification within an asynchronous session context, updating progress via a session method.",
  "sources": "Reads the progress token from ctx.meta and updates progress via the ProgressContext's progress method.",
  "sinks": "Calls session.send_progress_notification() to send progress updates, potentially over a network.",
  "flows": "ProgressContext.progress() updates internal current value and then calls session.send_progress_notification() with the token and current progress.",
  "anomalies": "The finally block in the context manager is empty; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard progress reporting pattern using data classes and context managers. It validates the presence of a progress token, updates progress, and sends notifications through an external session method. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The session's send method is external and assumed to be secure. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical progress reporting implementations. The main potential security concern is the external send method, but this is outside the code scope. The scores from the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of progress tracking with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk is justified by the network communication, which is typical for such mechanisms. No modifications are necessary.",
