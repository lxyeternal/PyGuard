{
  "purpose": "The code manages progress updates within a session, providing context managers and data structures to handle progress notifications asynchronously.",
  "sources": "The code reads the progress token from the request context meta data.",
  "sinks": "The code sends progress notifications via the session object using send_progress_notification method.",
  "flows": "ProgressContext.progress method reads progress token and updates progress, then sends data through session.send_progress_notification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. No external inputs or untrusted data manipulations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes and context managers to track and send progress updates asynchronously. It ensures the presence of a progress token before proceeding. The send_progress_notification method is invoked with current progress data. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or malicious data handling observed. The code appears well-structured and intended for legitimate progress reporting in an asynchronous environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, serving as a progress notification utility within a session-based context. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks identified.",
