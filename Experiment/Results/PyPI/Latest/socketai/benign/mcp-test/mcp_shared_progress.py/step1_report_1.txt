  "purpose": "Defines a progress reporting mechanism with context management for session-based communication",
  "sources": "Input: ctx.meta.progressToken, ctx.session; Data flow from progress() parameters to session.send_progress_notification()",
  "sinks": "session.send_progress_notification() method, which potentially transmits progress updates over the network",
  "flows": "ProgressContext.progress() updates self.current, then calls session.send_progress_notification() with the progress data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior; use of context managers and data classes is standard",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides a structured way to track and report progress within a session, using a context manager to encapsulate the process. It relies on provided context objects for session and progress tokens, with no suspicious data handling, code injection, or data leakage observed. The session's send_progress_notification() is a standard communication method, and no malicious code or backdoors are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of progress tracking and reporting within a session-based system. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The structure follows common patterns and does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious activity.",
