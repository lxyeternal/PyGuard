  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate CLI tool with dynamic plugin loading and subprocess execution, exhibiting no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The primary security concern is the potential for exploitation if user inputs are untrusted, but current safeguards are reasonable. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3) due to the inherent risks of dynamic code execution and subprocess handling."
