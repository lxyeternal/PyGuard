  "purpose": "The code provides command-line tools for managing MCP servers, including dynamic module loading, subprocess execution, and environment variable handling.",
  "sources": "User-supplied file paths, object names, environment variable options, and environment files.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to external commands ('npx', 'uv'), dynamic import of server modules, and environment variable injection into subprocess environments.",
  "flows": "Input sources (file paths, env vars) influence dynamic module import and subprocess execution, with environment variables passed into subprocesses.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'shell=True' in subprocess calls on Windows, reliance on user inputs for module paths and object names without explicit validation, potential for command injection if inputs are malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs dynamic imports based on user inputs, executes external commands via subprocess, and manages environment variables. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. While the dynamic nature introduces potential attack vectors if inputs are malicious, the code includes validation steps such as file existence checks and path resolution. The subprocess calls are generally sanitized, but the use of 'shell=True' on Windows could be exploited if inputs are untrusted. Overall, the code is a standard CLI utility for plugin management and server execution, with typical security considerations. No malicious payloads or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate CLI tool with dynamic plugin loading and subprocess execution, exhibiting no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The primary security concern is the potential for exploitation if user inputs are untrusted, but current safeguards are reasonable. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3) due to the inherent risks of dynamic code execution and subprocess handling.",
