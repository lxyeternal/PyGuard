{
  "purpose": "The code primarily defines module imports, exports, and type annotations for a Python package related to client-server communication and shared types, likely for an API or SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.client.session, .client.stdio, .server.session, .server.stdio, .shared.exceptions, .types). No user input or external data sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform insecure operations are present. No code writes to files, executes external commands, or interacts with network sockets directly.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports classes and constants without data manipulation or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and primarily consists of import/export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a module that organizes and exposes various classes, constants, and types for a larger package. It does not perform any runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, code injection, or backdoors. All elements appear to serve legitimate purposes related to API or SDK structure.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the static review, the code is benign and intended for modular organization and type definitions within a package. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
