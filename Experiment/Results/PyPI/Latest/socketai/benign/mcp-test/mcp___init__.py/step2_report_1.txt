  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core points: presence of malicious code, logical flaws, scoring consistency, and justification for risk levels.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely import/export statements, no data processing, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, a module aggregating imports for an API/SDK, no external data handling.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no anomalies, no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Benign, no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** An API interface module, primarily import/export, no runtime logic.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, import/export of types and classes, no data processing.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — slightly above zero.\n- **Justification for risk=0.1:** The slight increase might reflect the generic nature of API modules, but given the lack of any suspicious activity, this is likely an overestimation. The risk score should probably remain at 0 unless there's additional context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others—import/export module for API/SDK.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, which is appropriate given the code's static import/export nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Most are zero, with one at 0.1. Given the content, a risk score of 0.1 seems unwarranted; the code is purely structural.\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** All correctly assign 0.\n- **Risk:** For the report with 0.1, I suggest lowering it to 0, as there's no evidence of any security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk:** 0 for all reports, given the static, import/export nature and absence of suspicious patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with the code snippet. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The minor risk score of 0.1 in one report should be adjusted downward to 0 for accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign module organizing imports and exports for a client-server SDK. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores are generally appropriate, with a slight adjustment to the risk score in one report.",
