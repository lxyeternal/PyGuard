  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, structural module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and should be maintained at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a minimal risk score of 0.1 being acceptable if retained, though zero is also justified."
