{
  "purpose": "This module appears to define and export various classes, functions, and constants related to client-server communication, including session management, request/response types, capabilities, and notifications, for a larger system likely involving JSON-RPC protocol.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load modules and classes, primarily from relative package paths and specific type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, eval, exec, or file writes are present. No data processing or untrusted input handling is visible within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "This code mainly imports and re-exports components; it does not contain explicit data flows, processing logic, or data handling paths.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely declarative, with no evidence of suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors. The imports are standard and do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The module consists solely of import statements and an __all__ list defining public API exports. It serves as an interface or API definition for a larger package, likely facilitating JSON-RPC communication. No execution, data handling, or network operations are present here. The absence of code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns indicates a standard, benign structure typical of a library module.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward package interface or API definition with no malicious code or security risks. It does not include any operations that could be exploited or indicate malicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal.",
