  "purpose": "Define a generic data structure for request context encapsulating request ID, metadata, session, and lifespan context.",
  "sources": "Import statements for dataclass, typing, and external modules; class attributes in RequestContext.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no direct data output or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules into class definition, primarily for type annotations and data storage.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a parameterized dataclass for request context. The type variables and class attributes align with typical design patterns for request handling. No untrusted data input, no external network interactions, and no suspicious logic or code obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a request context data structure with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
