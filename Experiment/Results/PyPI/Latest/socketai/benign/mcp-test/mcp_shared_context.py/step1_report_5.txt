{
  "purpose": "Define a generic request context data structure for managing request metadata, session, and lifespan context.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (dataclasses, typing) and local modules (mcp.shared.session, mcp.types). No input reading or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs identified; code is primarily type and data structure definition.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to data structure initialization and typing; no untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic data class 'RequestContext' with type parameters for session and lifespan context. It utilizes standard Python features and typing extensions. The imported modules suggest it's part of a larger system managing sessions and request parameters. No external input handling, data processing, or potentially malicious operations are present. The structure appears straightforward and consistent with typical request context management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless data class definition for request context management with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
