{
  "purpose": "Define a generic data structure for request context, encapsulating request ID, metadata, session, and lifespan context.",
  "sources": "Imports from dataclasses, typing, and custom modules for session and request types.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks; no external data output or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "No complex data flow; data is stored within the dataclass, no external data flow or processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code constructs. Usage of type variables and generics appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a data class with type parameters for session and lifespan context, utilizing standard Python typing and dataclass features. Imports are from well-known libraries and custom modules. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious code. No external data handling, network operations, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be a straightforward type-safe container for request context data.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as a type-safe container for request-related data with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
