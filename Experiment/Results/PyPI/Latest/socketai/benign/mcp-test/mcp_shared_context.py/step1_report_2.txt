{
  "purpose": "Define a generic data structure for request context, including request ID, metadata, session, and lifespan context.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries and local modules (dataclasses, typing, mcp.shared.session, mcp.types)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines a data class.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. Use of type variables and generics appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines type variables for session and lifespan context, and declares a dataclass with generic parameters. It stores request metadata and IDs along with session and context objects. No external data input, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, safe definition of a request context data structure with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
