  "purpose": "Define a generic data class RequestContext for managing request-related data including request ID, metadata, session, and lifespan context.",
  "sources": "Import statements for dataclasses, typing, and specific modules; class and variable definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code primarily defines data structures without processing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this code is purely structural and does not process or handle external input or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious patterns observed. Use of modern typing features is consistent with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a generic dataclass 'RequestContext' with type parameters for session and lifespan context. It relies on external modules for session and request parameter types. There are no dynamic evaluations, network operations, or handling of untrusted input. The structure is straightforward and appears to serve as a container for request data, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious definition of a request context data container. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
