  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, type-safe data structure defining a request context.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, external data handling, or network activity is observed.\n- The code uses standard Python features (dataclasses, generics, type variables) and imports from known modules.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n\n**Review of scores:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, which is reasonable given the code clarity.\n- Security risk: 0, as the code is purely structural with no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- None of the reports identify any actual security flaws, vulnerabilities, or malicious code.\n- The code is purely defining a data container, with no data processing, input handling, or external interactions.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- Given the nature of the code, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unwarranted.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a benign, standard implementation of a request context data structure with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
