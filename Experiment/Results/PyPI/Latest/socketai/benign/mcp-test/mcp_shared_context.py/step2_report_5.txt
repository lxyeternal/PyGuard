  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, type-safe data container defining a generic `RequestContext` class.\n- No external data handling, network activity, or untrusted input processing is present.\n- No suspicious or malicious code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The code relies on standard Python features, external modules, and well-understood design patterns.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated scores are also 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n\n**Security Risk Scores:**\n- All reports assign a security risk of 0, which seems appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Scores Review:**\n- The scores are consistent across reports and justified by the analysis.\n- No report suggests any suspicious activity or potential vulnerabilities.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- The code is purely structural; it does not process data, so no vulnerabilities are introduced here.\n- Since no external input is handled, no injection or data validation issues are present.\n- The use of generics and type annotations appears standard and safe.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a standard, well-structured data class for request context management with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is justified.",
