{
  "purpose": "Defines a generic, type-safe data container 'RequestContext' for encapsulating request-related data such as request ID, metadata, session, and lifespan context.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'dataclasses', 'typing', 'typing_extensions', and external modules 'mcp.shared.session' and 'mcp.types'. No external data input or untrusted sources are processed within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data, perform network operations, or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is a static data structure without data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, using standard Python features with clear syntax. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic data class 'RequestContext' with attributes for request ID, optional metadata, session, and lifespan context. It imports standard and external modules but does not perform any data processing, input handling, or external interactions. The class serves as a simple container for request-related data, with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The use of type variables and generics aligns with best practices, and the code is readable and well-structured. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a request context data structure with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified by the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
