{
  "purpose": "The code defines data schemas for MCP communication, representing protocol messages, requests, responses, and notifications using Pydantic models. It serves as a structured message format for protocol implementation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from external sources such as URIs, URL fields, and untrusted data in request parameters (e.g., 'Any' types, URL fields). These are validated but are not processed or executed.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or execution. The code only validates data schemas without processing or executing the data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external untrusted sources into validated schema models, but no further processing or transmission occurs within this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious constructs. The code is purely declarative schema definitions with standard validation practices. Use of 'extra=\"allow\"' and 'Any' types is typical for flexible schemas, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of Pydantic models defining protocol message schemas for MCP communication. It includes constants, message formats, request/response structures, and notification types. No executable logic, network calls, or dynamic code evaluation are present. URL validation is used for resource identifiers, and 'Any' types are used for flexible data fields. The models permit extra fields, which is standard for protocol extensibility. No secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The schema-only nature minimizes security risks. Potential concerns about untrusted data are mitigated by validation, and no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive, schema-only implementation of MCP protocol messages, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or executable logic. It is safe for use in protocol implementations. The minimal risk score (0.1) reflects the potential for untrusted data in schema fields, but overall, the code is benign.",
