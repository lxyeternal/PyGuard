  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive, schema-only implementation of MCP protocol messages, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or executable logic. It is safe for use in protocol implementations. The minimal risk score (0.1) reflects the potential for untrusted data in schema fields, but overall, the code is benign."
