{
  "purpose": "This code defines data models and protocol message schemas for a Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation, facilitating client-server interactions, resource management, and messaging functionalities.",
  "sources": "Code imports and class definitions, especially the import of 'pydantic' for data validation and the schema descriptions for various request/response models.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted input data directly in an insecure manner. The code does not include any executable logic, network operations, or data handling that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up data schemas; there are no active data flows or logic paths. It defines the structure of messages but does not implement processing logic or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. The code is purely schema definitions and protocol specifications with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. All models are standard data containers with no hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of Pydantic model definitions and type annotations intended for protocol messaging in a client-server setup. It explicitly allows extra fields in models, consistent with protocol flexibility but not suspicious. There are no functions executing external commands, network operations, or data processing beyond data validation. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or other indicators of malicious intent are present. The structure is consistent with standard protocol schema definitions, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a schema and protocol definition module for a client-server communication protocol. It contains no executable or malicious code, and there are no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage. Its purpose is to define data models and message formats for a standardized protocol.",
