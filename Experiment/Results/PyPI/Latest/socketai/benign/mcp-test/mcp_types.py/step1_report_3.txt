{
  "purpose": "The code defines data models and message schemas for a Model Context Protocol (MCP) used in client-server communication, including requests, responses, notifications, and capabilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from collections.abc, typing, pydantic modules, and embedded string docstrings defining protocol specifications.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code does not include network calls, system commands, or untrusted input handling that could lead to data leakage or execution.",
  "flows": "The code primarily structures data for request/response flows and notifications; there are no executable flows or external data handling within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. The docstrings and schema definitions appear consistent with protocol documentation. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides detailed Pydantic models for protocol messages, requests, responses, and notifications used in MCP communication. It strictly defines data schemas with no executable logic, network access, or external resource interactions. The use of type aliases and generic classes supports structured message passing. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious code, or anomalies beyond standard protocol schema definitions. The code appears to be a well-structured, schema-only implementation for communication protocols, with no embedded or hidden malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a schema and protocol definition for MCP communication, with no malicious or sabotage elements. It contains no executable or network-interacting code, and no suspicious patterns or secrets are embedded. It appears safe and purely descriptive.",
