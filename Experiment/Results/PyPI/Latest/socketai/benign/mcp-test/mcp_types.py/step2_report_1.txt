  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines data schemas for MCP communication, referencing external libraries (pydantic, URL validation). No external input processing occurs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data is processed or executed; only schema definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious constructs; standard protocol constants and data models.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely declarative, schema-only, with no malicious behavior or security risks. Risk score: **0.1** (minimal, protocol-defining code).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar schema definitions for MCP, with focus on data validation via pydantic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No active data processing, network calls, or code execution.\n- **Anomalies:** No backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Schema-only, safe, with no malicious intent. Risk score: **0**.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Protocol message schemas for MCP, no external input handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No executable logic, network activity, or data processing beyond validation.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Pure schema definitions, safe. Risk score: **0**.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Data models for protocol messaging, with some potential for untrusted data in URL/resource fields.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Untrusted data (URIs, arguments) flow into models but are validated as URIs/URLs.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Use of 'Any' is typical for flexible schemas.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The potential risk is in untrusted data being accepted, but validation mitigates this. No executable or malicious behavior. Risk score: **0.1**.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar schema definitions, with focus on data validation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into models, but no execution or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe schema definitions, low risk. Risk score: **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly identify that the code is schema-only, with no malicious code, backdoors, or executable logic. Malware score should be **0**.\n- **Obfuscated:** The code is clear, well-structured, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. Obfuscated score should be **0**.\n- **Risk:** The overall security risk is minimal. The only potential concern is untrusted data (URIs, arguments) being accepted, but with proper validation, this does not pose a significant threat. A reasonable risk score: **0.1**.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a set of protocol message schemas using Pydantic, designed for structured communication.\n- No executable logic, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No secrets, credentials, or backdoors are embedded.\n- The only minor concern relates to accepting untrusted data, but validation is in place.\n- Therefore, the overall malware and obfuscated scores are **0**, and the risk score remains very low, around **0.1**.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Malware score: 0**  \n**Obfuscated score: 0**  \n**Risk score: 0.1**  \n\nThis code is safe, schema-only, and suitable for use in protocol implementations.",
