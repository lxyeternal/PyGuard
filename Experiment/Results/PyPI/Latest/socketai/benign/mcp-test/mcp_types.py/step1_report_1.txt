{
  "purpose": "The code defines data models and protocol message schemas for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) used for communication between clients and servers, particularly in AI/LLM contexts.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines data schemas and constants. It references external libraries for URL validation and typing but does not execute any external input handling.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed; the code solely defines data structures and constants.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows; the code only establishes data model schemas used in communication protocols.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be purely declarative with schema definitions, with no suspicious or unusual logic, hard-coded credentials, or backdoors. It includes standard protocol constants and type definitions without obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code provides comprehensive data model definitions for a JSON-RPC based protocol used for AI/LLM interactions. It uses standard Python practices with pydantic for data validation, and there are no indications of malicious code, obfuscated segments, or runtime evaluation. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or executable logic are present. The references to URLs are for resource identification and are not malicious. The constants are standard protocol error codes, and all models appear to be for serialization/deserialization of messages. Overall, the code is a straightforward, schema-defining module with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, schema-only protocol definition for MCP communication, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. It does not contain any network activity, executable logic, or hidden backdoors. The risk level is minimal, and it is safe to use.",
