{
  "purpose": "This code implements an asynchronous JSON-RPC session handler for managing requests, responses, notifications, and cancellations over read/write streams, facilitating communication in a request-response protocol.",
  "sources": "The code reads incoming messages from the '_read_stream' (which can include requests, notifications, errors, or responses) and receives data via the 'response_streams' for matching responses to requests.",
  "sinks": "Outgoing responses, notifications, and progress updates are sent through the '_write_stream'. Responses are generated for requests and cancellations, notifications are sent for events, and progress updates are transmitted as needed.",
  "flows": "Messages are received from '_read_stream', validated and dispatched based on type (request, notification, response). Requests spawn responders that manage responses and cancellations, while responses are matched to stored response streams. Notifications trigger handlers or cancellations, and responses/errors are sent via '_write_stream'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. Exception handling during validation is standard. No external malicious network calls or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured async JSON-RPC session handler. It manages message streams, request lifecycle, and cancellation properly. Validation and error handling follow typical patterns. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security flaws are detected. The code relies on common libraries and practices, with no signs of sabotage or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an asynchronous JSON-RPC session handler with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears safe and suitable for supply chain use.",
