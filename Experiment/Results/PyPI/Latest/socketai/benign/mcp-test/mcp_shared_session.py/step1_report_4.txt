{
  "purpose": "The code implements an asynchronous MCP (Message Control Protocol) session handler with request/response management, notification handling, and cancellation support.",
  "sources": "Reading from _read_stream (incoming messages), receiving data via response streams, reading request data, and handling notifications and responses.",
  "sinks": "Sending responses via _write_stream, sending notifications, and dispatching requests/responses; potential untrusted data flows into network output.",
  "flows": "Incoming messages from _read_stream flow through _receive_loop, processed into requests, notifications, or responses; responses and notifications are sent through _write_stream; request/responder lifecycle manages source-to-sink data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs. The code relies on standard async I/O, exception handling, and request-response patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily facilitates an asynchronous request-response protocol, managing request lifecycle, cancellation, and notification processing. It uses standard libraries and patterns such as context managers, task groups, and async streams. No suspicious external calls or hidden behavior are present. The use of cancellation scopes and response streams is consistent with normal asynchronous communication patterns. No data exfiltration or malicious behavior is detectable. Overall, the code appears to be a typical implementation of an async RPC session handler with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured asynchronous session handler for MCP communication, with no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It performs request/response handling, notifications, and cancellation safely without suspicious patterns.",
