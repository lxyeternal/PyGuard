  "purpose": "Create in-memory communication channels and connected client-server sessions for MCP protocol testing or simulation.",
  "sources": "User or external code providing input data to streams, especially the create_client_server_memory_streams and create_connected_server_and_client_session functions, which read from and write to memory streams.",
  "sinks": "Streams that could potentially send untrusted JSONRPCMessages or Exceptions, and the server.run method which processes incoming data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input into streams created by create_client_server_memory_streams, then into server.run or ClientSession methods, and back through the streams to the other endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. The code uses standard async context managers and stream creation. No unusual or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to create in-memory streams and establish client-server communication sessions. Streams are created with anyio's memory object stream, which is standard for in-memory IPC. The functions set up asynchronous contexts and task groups properly, ensuring clean setup and teardown. The server is run in a background task, and the client session is initialized within the context. All data flows are contained within memory, with no external data access or side effects. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code appears designed for testing or simulation purposes, utilizing standard libraries and practices without any suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for in-memory MCP communication testing. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are detected. It uses standard async patterns and stream handling. The overall security risk is very low.",
