  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup for in-memory client-server testing within the MCP framework. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is minimal. The only correction needed is to fix the resource management syntax. Overall, the reports accurately assess the code's safety and purpose."
