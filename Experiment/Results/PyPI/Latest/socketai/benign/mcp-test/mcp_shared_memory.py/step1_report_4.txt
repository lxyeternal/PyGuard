{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to create in-memory communication streams and establish a client-server session for testing or simulation purposes.",
  "sources": "Data flows from create_client_server_memory_streams() where in-memory streams are created, and from the server.run() method which receives stream inputs; client session reads from and writes to these streams.",
  "sinks": "The client_session and server components that read from and write to the memory streams; no external data sinks or network connections are involved.",
  "flows": "In-memory streams transfer JSONRPCMessage or Exception objects between client and server; server.run() consumes streams for server-side handling; client_session interacts with streams for client-side communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code patterns, or suspicious behavior are present. Usage of in-memory streams for communication is typical for testing purposes. No code injection, data leakage, or environment variable misuse detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up in-memory bidirectional communication streams between a client and server using the anyio library, mainly for testing or simulation. It creates memory object streams with a buffer size of 1, manages their lifecycle with async context managers, and runs the server within a task group. The client session is initialized and connected to these streams, enabling communication without network activity. No external data sources, sinks, or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The design appears standard for testing frameworks involving in-memory communication. The code structure is clear and adheres to common asynchronous patterns; no obfuscation or malicious intent is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup for in-memory client-server communication used primarily for testing or simulation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, with no suspicious anomalies or malicious signals.",
