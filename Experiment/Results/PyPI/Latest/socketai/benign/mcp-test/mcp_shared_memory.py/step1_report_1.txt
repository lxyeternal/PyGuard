{
  "purpose": "Create in-memory streams for client-server communication and manage connected client sessions for MCP protocol testing or interaction.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it creates streams internally and initializes client sessions with given parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is directed to external systems; the code does not write data to external locations or perform network operations beyond internal streams.",
  "flows": "Data flows between created in-memory streams during client-server communication, primarily within the context of testing or simulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious logic. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious code is present. The use of async context managers and task groups appears standard for async management.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up in-memory communication streams for client-server interaction, utilizing well-known libraries such as anyio. It creates memory object streams, manages asynchronous tasks, and handles session lifecycle appropriately. No external input is processed in a suspicious way; no external network connections, no file system access, or sensitive data handling outside the in-memory scope. The code appears to be intended for testing or simulation purposes, with no malicious intent detected. The functions and class usage are typical for async Python code managing client-server sessions. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malware-like behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup for in-memory client-server communication within the MCP framework. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
