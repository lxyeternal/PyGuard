  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to lack of visible comments or documentation, but it appears to perform some data processing or network operations.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules or files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data outputs, though specifics are not clear from the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables, function inputs) through processing functions to output or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies or hardcoded credentials are visible; code structure appears standard. However, the absence of context limits detection of subtle malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python features and third-party libraries without obfuscated patterns or suspicious constructs. No clear indicators of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The code's intent appears legitimate based on visible structure, but the lack of detailed comments or context prevents a thorough assessment. No unusual or potentially harmful code behaviors are detected in the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evident malicious behavior or security risk. The code appears benign, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. However, the limited context prevents absolute certainty; further review with complete code and documentation is recommended.",
