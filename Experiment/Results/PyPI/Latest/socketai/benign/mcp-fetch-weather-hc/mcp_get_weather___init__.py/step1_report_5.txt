{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that performs basic data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from function parameters, environment variables, or standard input (if present in the actual code).",
  "sinks": "Data could potentially be written to files, network connections, or output streams depending on the functions used.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input sources (e.g., environment variables or external input) may flow into processing functions that could lead to insecure operations if not properly sanitized.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs are apparent. No obfuscated code, suspicious network calls, or dangerous system modifications are visible in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with typical data handling routines. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or system compromise mechanisms. The absence of suspicious imports or functions reduces concern. Without additional context or external code, no malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be benign, but a more comprehensive review with full context would be necessary for absolute certainty.",
