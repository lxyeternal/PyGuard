  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, code execution functions (eval/exec), data flows from inputs to outputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, dynamic code execution points, network connections, file modifications.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user input) to sinks (eval/exec, network, file system).",
  "anomalies": "Potential use of eval/exec functions, minimal or missing code, absence of suspicious patterns, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or benign code with no explicit malicious indicators. The malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of malicious code. The obfuscated scores are zero, matching the lack of obfuscation. Security risk scores are generally low (0.2), justified by the limited code context. Report 4's suspicion of eval/exec functions warrants further verification; if confirmed, malware and risk scores should be increased accordingly. Confidence levels are appropriate given the available information. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified, with minor room for adjusting risk scores downward for benign snippets.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign with no detected malware or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are appropriate, though they could be slightly lowered if further analysis confirms the absence of dynamic code execution functions. No significant security concerns are identified based on current data.",
