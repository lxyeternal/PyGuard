{
  "purpose": "The code prints a greeting message indicating it is related to a weather-fetching application called 'mcp-get-weather'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only executes a print statement.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present, as there is no data processing, storage, or external communication.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving sources or sinks; the code simply runs a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very simple and straightforward, with no unusual constructs, hidden code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a main() function that outputs a static message. The __name__ check ensures main() runs only when executed as a script. There are no external data reads, no dynamic code execution, no credentials, and no network activity. The structure is minimal and typical for a basic script.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a benign, simple script primarily serving as a placeholder or starting point for a weather application.",
