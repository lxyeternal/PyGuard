  "purpose": "Simple script that outputs a greeting message, likely for weather information retrieval or demonstration.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code does not read external input or user data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs other than printing to console; no external data transmission or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code only performs a print operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward and minimalistic code with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a main function that prints a static message and a conditional to invoke main(). It does not include any external data sources, network communication, environment variable access, or other potentially malicious behavior. The simplicity indicates it is likely a basic script intended for a greeting or placeholder purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code presents no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is a benign, simple script with no security concerns.",
