  "purpose": "A minimal Python script that prints a static greeting message.",
  "sources": "No external input, data processing, or data reading; static print statement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "None, as the code only executes a print statement without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and contains no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a main() function that prints a fixed message. It contains no external data inputs, no network activity, no file operations, and no obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and behavior. No logical flaws or assumptions are present. The code's benign nature is evident, and the analysis confirms no threats or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, static script with no malicious intent or security concerns. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with its benign nature.",
