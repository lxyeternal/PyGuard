  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; the code simply executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a straightforward main function that prints a static message. There are no external inputs, no environment variable reads, network calls, file operations, or other potentially malicious activities. The code structure is simple and typical for a small script, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. It appears to be a benign, minimal script intended for illustrative or testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only outputs a static message and does not interact with any external data or systems.",
