  "conclusion": "The code is a benign weather data fetcher with a security concern due to a hardcoded API key. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The primary risk is credential exposure, which should be mitigated in production by using environment variables. Scores are consistent with the code's behavior."
