  "purpose": "Fetches weather data from Seniverse API and formats it for display.",
  "sources": "API request to https://api.seniverse.com/v3/weather/now.json with hardcoded API key, reading city parameter, handling JSON response.",
  "sinks": "Response JSON parsing, returning formatted string; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Input city parameter -> API request with API_KEY -> JSON response -> data formatting -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded API key; no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate API requests to fetch weather data, handles errors gracefully, and formats output. The main security concern is the hardcoded API key, which could be exposed if the code is shared. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The request and response flows are standard and transparent. Scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are appropriate; security risk score (~0.2-0.3) reflects the API key exposure concern but not active malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign weather data fetcher with a security concern due to a hardcoded API key. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The primary risk is credential exposure, which should be mitigated in production by using environment variables. Scores are consistent with the code's behavior.",
