  "purpose": "Fetch and format weather data from the Seniverse API for specified cities",
  "sources": "API_KEY hardcoded as a string, environment variables are not used, data fetched via httpx.AsyncClient.get()",
  "sinks": "API request to external server, response processing, printing results",
  "flows": "Input city name -> fetch_weather_seniverse -> format_weather_seniverse -> output",
  "anomalies": "API_KEY is hardcoded in source code; no obfuscated code or unusual language features detected; no backdoors or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a weather service that retrieves data from an external API using an API key embedded in the code, which could be considered a security risk but not malicious. It uses standard HTTP requests and processes JSON data, with error handling. No malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code primarily performs network I/O to fetch weather data, formats it, and provides an API interface. The API key hardcoding poses a security concern but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a weather data fetcher with proper error handling. It does not contain malware or malicious behaviors. The main security concern is the hardcoded API key, which should be stored securely, but this is a common practice in example code and does not imply malicious activity.",
