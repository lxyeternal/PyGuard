  "purpose": "Configuration script for building documentation using Sphinx for the MaritimeViz project.",
  "sources": "Import statements (os, sys, maritimeviz), sys.path modification, and configuration variables (extensions, templates_path, etc.).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no code explicitly outputs untrusted data or interacts with external systems based on user input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; configuration values are static or derived from safe package attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed. The sys.path modification is typical for local package imports.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up Sphinx documentation configuration by importing necessary modules, adjusting sys.path, and defining various configuration parameters. It imports the 'maritimeviz' package to access its version information, but does not execute or execute untrusted code. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behavior is evident. The code adheres to standard documentation build practices without suspicious constructs or external data interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily sets static configuration parameters for documentation generation. No malware or security threats are detected.",
