  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building documentation with Sphinx for the MaritimeViz project.",
  "sources": "Standard library modules (os, sys), maritimeviz module import",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or output streams present",
  "flows": "sys.path modification to include parent directory, import of maritimeviz for version info",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; standard configuration code with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up Sphinx documentation configuration, including path adjustments, extension setups, and output options. It imports the maritimeviz module solely to obtain version information. No user input, network communication, or untrusted data handling is present. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or anomalies identified. The code is straightforward, typical for documentation build files, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply configures documentation generation parameters without any harmful operations.",
