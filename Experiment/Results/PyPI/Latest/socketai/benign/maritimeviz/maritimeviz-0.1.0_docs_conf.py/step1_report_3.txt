{
  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building project documentation using Sphinx for the 'MaritimeViz' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads from environment variables, imports 'maritimeviz' module, and reads local files for static assets and configurations.",
  "sinks": "None identified that could lead to data leaks or harmful actions. No untrusted data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No malicious data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static configuration data is processed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of sys.path insertion is standard for documentation projects.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with imports, path modifications, and project-specific settings. No external input handling, no network connections, no execution of dynamic code, and no suspicious behavior detected. The imported module 'maritimeviz' is used only to retrieve version info. The rest of the code is static configuration data intended for documentation generation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard documentation build configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs static setup for documentation purposes only.",
