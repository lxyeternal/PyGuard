  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building MaritimeViz documentation using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Imports from os, sys, and maritimeviz; sys.path modification; static configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Static imports and variable assignments; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static configuration code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx conf.py file. It imports standard modules and the maritimeviz package solely to access version info. It modifies sys.path in a typical manner for local package resolution. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are detected. The code's purpose is purely static configuration, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
