  "purpose": "Configuration script for building project documentation with Sphinx for the MaritimeViz project.",
  "sources": "Imports os, sys, and maritimeviz modules; reads configuration variables for Sphinx setup.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or used in a dangerous way.",
  "flows": "Imports modules -> modifies sys.path -> sets configuration variables for documentation build process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code performs standard configuration tasks without suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up Sphinx documentation build configuration, adjusting sys.path and importing the maritimeviz module to obtain version info. It primarily defines static configuration variables and paths for documentation generation. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network operations are present. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The script's purpose is purely to configure documentation build parameters, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It serves its purpose of configuring documentation generation without any suspicious activity.",
