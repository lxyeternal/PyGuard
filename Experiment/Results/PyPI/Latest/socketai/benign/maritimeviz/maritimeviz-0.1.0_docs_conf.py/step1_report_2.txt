  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building documentation of the MaritimeViz project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports (os, sys), maritimeviz module import, sys.path modification, and configuration variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data processing or external data transmission; no apparent data leaks or external effect.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly static configuration assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. The sys.path insertion is standard for local module access. The maritimeviz import relies on the installed package version, no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Sphinx configuration file with no dynamic or malicious code. It imports standard modules and a local package 'maritimeviz'. It adjusts sys.path for module resolution, which is a common practice. The rest are configuration parameters for documentation generation, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code is static, straightforward, and intended for project documentation build.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration script for documentation purposes, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
