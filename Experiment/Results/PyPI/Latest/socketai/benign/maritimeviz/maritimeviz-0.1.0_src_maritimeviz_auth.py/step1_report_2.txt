  "purpose": "Helper functions to load and store API tokens using a .env file, prompting the user if tokens are missing.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via os.environ.get and loading .env file with load_dotenv.",
  "sinks": "Writing new tokens to the .env file with set_key.",
  "flows": "Environment variable retrieval -> user prompt if missing -> save token to .env file.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code uses standard libraries and dotenv package appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code loads API tokens from a .env file and prompts the user to input tokens if not found. It then saves the token securely using set_key. The use of getpass ensures tokens are entered securely without echoing. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code interacts only with local files and user input, with no network communication or credential theft mechanisms. It appears to be a straightforward token management utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation for managing API tokens with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply prompts for input and saves tokens securely, following best practices.",
