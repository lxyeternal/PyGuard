{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions to load and store API tokens using a .env file, prompting the user for input if tokens are missing.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables with os.environ.get(token_key). It also reads the .env file via load_dotenv and prompts user input via getpass.getpass().",
  "sinks": "The code writes tokens to the .env file using set_key, which modifies environment variable storage.",
  "flows": "Tokens are retrieved from environment variables or user input; if not found, user input is saved to the .env file. Data flows from user input or environment variables into the application; saved tokens are stored in the .env file.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses getpass.getpass() to securely prompt for tokens, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling are present. The save operation directly updates the .env file without additional validation.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables from a .env file, prompts the user for an API token if not found, and then saves that token back to the .env file. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or suspicious data handling. The functions and imports are standard for managing environment-based credentials. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic are evident. The only potential concern is that tokens entered by the user are stored unencrypted in the .env file, but this is typical for such configurations and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward utility for managing API tokens securely in local environments. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks beyond the typical concern of storing sensitive tokens unencrypted in a file. Overall, it appears benign and intended for legitimate configuration management.",
