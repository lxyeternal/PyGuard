  "purpose": "Utility for loading and storing API tokens securely via environment variables, prompting user input if token is missing, and saving it to a .env file.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables from the .env file; prompts user for token input via getpass; writes token to the .env file using set_key.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows leading to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Load environment -> check token -> prompt user if missing -> save token to .env file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward token management. Tokens are stored unencrypted in plain text, which is standard but not secure.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables, prompts securely for missing tokens, and saves them back to a .env file. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The token storage in plain text is a known security consideration but not malicious. The logic is clear, with no suspicious code or backdoors. Scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The only concern is plain text token storage, which is typical for such utilities and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for managing API tokens with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The security risk is minimal and primarily related to plain text storage, which is common practice. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
