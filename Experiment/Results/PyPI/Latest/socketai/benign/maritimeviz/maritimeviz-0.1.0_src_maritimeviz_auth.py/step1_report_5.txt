  "purpose": "Helper functions to load and store API tokens using a .env file, prompting the user if the token is missing.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via os.environ.get; Reading the .env file via load_dotenv.",
  "sinks": "set_key writes the token into the .env file; getpass.getpass collects user input.",
  "flows": "load_or_get_token reads environment variables, prompts user for input if missing, and writes token back to the .env file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of getpass for token input is acceptable; saving tokens in plain text .env file is a common practice but can be risky if the file is exposed; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables from a .env file, prompting the user for a token if not found, then saves it back into the .env file. The use of getpass avoids displaying the token during input, and set_key updates the .env file accordingly. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or suspicious activities are present. The code manages API tokens securely within the intended scope but does not include encryption or additional security measures for token storage. Overall, the code performs standard environment variable handling with user input.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward helper for token management, with no malicious intent. It correctly prompts for input, updates the .env file, and reads tokens securely. No malware or security threats are identified.",
