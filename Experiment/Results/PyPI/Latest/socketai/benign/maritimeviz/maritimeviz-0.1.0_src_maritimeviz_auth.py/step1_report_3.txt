  "purpose": "Helper functions to load and store API tokens using a .env file, prompting the user if a token is missing.",
  "sources": "os.environ.get(token_key), getpass.getpass()",
  "sinks": "set_key(ENV_FILE, token_key, token)",
  "flows": "load_dotenv -> check environment variable -> prompt user -> save token to .env file",
  "anomalies": "None observed; standard use of environment variables and user input.",
  "analysis": "The code securely prompts for API tokens if not found in the environment, then saves them to a .env file. It uses standard libraries for environment management and user input, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of getpass ensures sensitive input is not echoed. The code does not connect to external servers or perform any destructive actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing API tokens with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
