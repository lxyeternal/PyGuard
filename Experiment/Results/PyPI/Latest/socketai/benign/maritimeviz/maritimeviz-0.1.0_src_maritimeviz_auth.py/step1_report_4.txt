  "purpose": "Helper functions to load and store API tokens securely using a .env file, prompting the user if token is missing.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via os.environ.get, reading the .env file via load_dotenv, user input via getpass.getpass.",
  "sinks": "set_key function writes tokens into the .env file; environment variable access via os.environ.get.",
  "flows": "Token retrieval from environment -> prompt user if missing -> save token into .env file -> return token.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code anomalies; standard usage of environment variable management and user prompting.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables from a .env file, prompts the user to input an API token if it's missing, and then saves this token back into the .env file. The use of getpass ensures secure input, and set_key safely writes the token. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The only potential security concern is the use of user input to store tokens, which is standard but relies on secure user practices. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward token management without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard environment variable handling and user prompting for API tokens. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It operates securely within its purpose.",
