  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment or docstring with no executable statements, data input/output, or external interactions. All reports confirm the absence of source, sink, or flow patterns, and no suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. Confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty that the code is non-malicious and non-obfuscated. No logical errors or vulnerabilities are identified. The code serves as a placeholder or documentation stub, posing no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only a comment or placeholder text with no executable or malicious content. All assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate, indicating no security risks or malware presence.",
