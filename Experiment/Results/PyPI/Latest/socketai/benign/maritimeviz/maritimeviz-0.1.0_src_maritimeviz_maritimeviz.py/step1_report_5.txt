  "sinks": "No potential sinks, data leaks, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows, input processing, or function calls involving external data detected.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a docstring and no executable statements or logic, which is unusual for a main module.",
  "analysis": "The provided code contains only a single comment string 'Main module.' and no executable code, function definitions, imports, or data handling. This minimal content suggests it is either a placeholder or an incomplete module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks present in the fragment. The absence of code means there are no source-to-sink flows or anomalous patterns to analyze.",
  "conclusion": "The code is essentially empty aside from a comment, posing no security threats or malicious intent. It appears to be a placeholder or template with no executable logic. No malicious activity or security risks are identified.",
