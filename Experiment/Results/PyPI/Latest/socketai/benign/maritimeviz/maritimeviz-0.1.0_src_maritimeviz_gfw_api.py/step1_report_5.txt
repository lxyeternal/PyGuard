{
  "purpose": "This module provides an API client for interacting with the Global Fishing Watch (GFW) API, including functions for searching vessels, retrieving fishing events, generating maps, and obtaining statistics and insights.",
  "sources": "User inputs for vessel identifiers, date ranges, and WKT polygons; environment variable for API token; data fetched via HTTP GET and POST requests to the GFW API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external API endpoints; printing responses and errors; setting environment variables for tokens.",
  "flows": "Input identifiers and parameters -> API request functions -> HTTP requests -> Response handling and caching -> Map/chart generation or data return.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. The token is loaded via an external function and can be updated securely.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an API client with token management, cache implementation, and multiple data retrieval functions. It uses standard requests for API communication, with error handling and caching. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The token is not hardcoded but loaded or updated securely. Map and heatmap functions are straightforward, generating visualizations from data. No signs of malicious activity, code injection, or data leaks were identified. The overall structure and behavior align with a legitimate data access library.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client for GFW data. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage, and no security risks are evident from this review.",
