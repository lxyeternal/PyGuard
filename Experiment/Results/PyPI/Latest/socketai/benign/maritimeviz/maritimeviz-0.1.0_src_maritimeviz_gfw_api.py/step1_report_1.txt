{
  "purpose": "Provides a client interface for interacting with the Global Fishing Watch API, including vessel search, fishing events, statistics, insights, and generating visualizations.",
  "sources": "Loads token via load_or_get_token() from auth module; reads environment variable GFW_API_TOKEN; receives parameters for API requests; reads request payloads and URL parameters.",
  "sinks": "Requests library makes HTTP requests; response JSON is returned and cached; environment variable GFW_API_TOKEN is set; outputs include print statements, some of which may log data.",
  "flows": "Token is loaded at initialization and can be updated via token setter, which writes to environment variable; API request functions send data via POST or GET; responses are cached and returned; mapping functions generate maps based on data; print statements output responses and logs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for debugging; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; environment variable is set but no sensitive info hardcoded; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected; no hidden or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily acts as a wrapper around the GFW API, handling API requests with proper headers and caching. It manages tokens securely by loading them from an external function and allows updates with validation. No suspicious or malicious code is present; no backdoors, system access, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The print statements are for debugging and do not pose a security risk. Use of environment variables for token storage is standard. All API interactions appear legitimate for their intended purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a legitimate API client for GFW, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It does not contain any obfuscated code, hidden malicious logic, or suspicious data flows. It manages tokens securely and performs expected operations with no malicious intent detected.",
