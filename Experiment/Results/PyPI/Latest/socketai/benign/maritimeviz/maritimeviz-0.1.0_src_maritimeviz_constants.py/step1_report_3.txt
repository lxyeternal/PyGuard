{
  "purpose": "Define constants, data types, and SQL table creation queries for managing AIS message data and related views.",
  "sources": "Reading of predefined constant lists, SQL query strings, and configuration dictionaries. No input or external data sources are read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "SQL query execution and view creation. No untrusted data processing or external output operations detected.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks. The code contains static SQL strings and configuration data only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscated code observed. All SQL queries are static and parameterized externally. No code appears to perform unintended system actions.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a set of static constants, data type definitions, and SQL CREATE TABLE statements for AIS message data storage. The SQL queries are plain and static, with no user input or external data interpolated into the queries, reducing risk of injection. The views are also static and designed for data aggregation. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, or network operations. The code appears to serve a data modeling and database schema purpose only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration and schema definition module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely defines data structures and static SQL queries for AIS message data management. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or malware vectors are detected.",
