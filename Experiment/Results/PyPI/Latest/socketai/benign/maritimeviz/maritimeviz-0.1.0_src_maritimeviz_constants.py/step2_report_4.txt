  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential security concerns, malware indicators, obfuscation, and consistency with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is static, defining constants, data types, and SQL table/view creation queries. No dynamic execution or untrusted data handling is present.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** None detected.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign, purely schema definitions.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- malware: 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- risk: 0 (no security risk)  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static constants and SQL queries with no runtime data processing.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No issues found.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious intent.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- risk: 0  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, highlighting static SQL schema setup.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Absent.\n- **Security Risk:** Minimal.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- risk: 0.1 (slightly above zero but justified as the code is purely static; perhaps a very conservative note, but still low risk)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Continues the pattern of static schema definitions with no dynamic or untrusted data handling.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- risk: 0  \n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others—static constants, SQL queries, no dynamic code or external input.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs.\n- **Security Risk:** None.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- risk: 0  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** None. The code is purely static, defining schemas, constants, and views.\n- **Malware potential:** None. No code executes untrusted data, no network calls, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Obfuscation:** Absent. The code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; the code is configuration/schema setup, not runtime logic.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The slight elevation of the \"securityRisk\" score in report 3 to 0.1 is acceptable but could be lowered to 0 for consistency, given the static nature.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard schema and constants setup for an AIS data management system, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate; the code is safe, static, and standard for database schema definitions.
