{
  "purpose": "The code defines constants, data types, and SQL table creation queries for managing AIS (Automatic Identification System) messages, including views for static and dynamic data aggregation.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources are directly read in this code; it primarily contains static definitions and SQL queries.",
  "sinks": "SQL queries for table creation and views are present, but they do not execute or process untrusted data; they are static string definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is observable; the code solely defines schema and view logic without dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are detected. The SQL queries are static, straightforward, and standard for database schema setup.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of predefined constants, data type definitions, and static SQL queries for database schema creation. It lacks functions, data input handling, or dynamic execution that could be exploited. The views aggregate data from existing tables without executing untrusted code or executing any dynamic queries based on external input. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, network communications, or backdoors. The code's structure and content indicate typical application setup for AIS data management without any suspicious or malicious components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign schema definition and constants setup for AIS data handling with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is standard application code for database initialization.",
