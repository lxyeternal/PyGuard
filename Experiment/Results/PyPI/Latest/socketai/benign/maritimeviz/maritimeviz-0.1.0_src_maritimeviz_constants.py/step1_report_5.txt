{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants, data structures, and SQL table creation queries related to AIS (Automatic Identification System) message processing for maritime vessel tracking and reporting.",
  "sources": "The code reads static Python constants, lists, SQL query strings, and class definitions, with no external input sources or untrusted data inputs present.",
  "sinks": "The SQL query strings could potentially be executed against a database, but they do not include any dynamic user input or untrusted data. No code injection, command execution, or external network calls are evident.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the SQL statements are static and predefined. The data structures (TypedDict, Enums) are for organizing data schemas, not for data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code strictly defines constants and SQL schema creation queries without dynamic or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static constants, SQL schema queries, and class definitions for data types. There are no functions, user input handling, or network interactions. The SQL queries are static and do not incorporate user-supplied parameters directly, reducing the risk of injection. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are observed. The code appears to be part of a structured system for AIS data management, with clear separation of static data, schema definitions, and views.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup module for AIS data schemas and view definitions. It contains no malicious intent, no dynamic code execution, and no external data handling that could lead to vulnerabilities. It appears safe and intended for legitimate data management purposes.",
