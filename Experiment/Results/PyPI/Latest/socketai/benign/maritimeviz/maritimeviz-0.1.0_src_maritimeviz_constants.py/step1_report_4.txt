  "purpose": "Defines constants, data types, and SQL table/view creation queries for AIS message processing and storage.",
  "sources": "Constant lists, SQL query strings, and class definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "SQL queries executed on a database; no direct sinks involving untrusted input are evident.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; queries are static strings, and data is handled externally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. No obfuscated code, no backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured collection of constants, SQL table creation statements, and data type definitions. All SQL statements are static and predefined, with no dynamic construction from user input. No input/output handling or network activity is present. The classes and constants serve as data schemas or configuration, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The code appears purely for data modeling and database schema management.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is safe, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It is a configuration and schema definition module without any harmful logic.",
