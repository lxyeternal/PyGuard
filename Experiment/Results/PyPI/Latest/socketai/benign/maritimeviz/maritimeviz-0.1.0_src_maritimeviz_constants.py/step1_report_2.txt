{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants, data types, SQL table creation queries, and views for handling AIS message data in a maritime tracking system.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from predefined lists, constants, and string literals representing SQL queries and configuration data.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs SQL queries for creating database tables and views; no direct data sinks or external communication are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow involves defining data schemas, then using those schemas to generate SQL statements for database setup; no runtime data processing or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code uses static data and well-structured SQL strings. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines constants, data types, and SQL queries for database schema setup related to AIS messages. No input/output operations, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The SQL strings are static, with no user input concatenation or parameterization that could lead to injection. The data types and view definitions are standard. Overall, the code appears to be purely configuration and schema setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks in this code. It is a standard setup for database schemas and static data definitions related to AIS message handling. The code is safe, with low confidence of malicious intent.",
