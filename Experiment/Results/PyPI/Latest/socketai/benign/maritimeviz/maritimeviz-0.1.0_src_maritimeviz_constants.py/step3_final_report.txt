  "purpose": "Defines constants, data types, and SQL schema creation queries for AIS message data management, including static and dynamic tables and views.",
  "sources": "Static SQL query strings, constant lists, and data type definitions; no external data input or runtime data processing.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or execute dynamic code.",
  "flows": "Static schema definitions are used for database setup; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises static constants, data type definitions, and SQL queries for creating tables and views related to AIS data. There is no dynamic data handling, user input, or external data fetching. The SQL queries are static strings, not constructed from untrusted input, minimizing injection risks. No network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated/malicious code is present. The views aggregate data from existing tables without executing untrusted code. Overall, the code is purely schema and configuration data, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and intended for database schema setup for AIS data management. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
