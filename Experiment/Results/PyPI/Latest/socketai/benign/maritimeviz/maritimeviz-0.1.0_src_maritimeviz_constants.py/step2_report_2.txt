  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence they present regarding potential security issues, malware, obfuscation, and logical flaws.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is static, defining constants, data types, and SQL schema creation queries for AIS data management. No dynamic data handling, no execution of untrusted input, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is purely schema definitions and constants, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0 — reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code content. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is static configuration and schema setup with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is static, with no runtime data processing or external input handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears benign and well-structured.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, static constants and SQL queries, no runtime input, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is purely configuration and schema definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1 — the slight non-zero security risk might be due to the presence of SQL queries, but since they are static, this is acceptable.\n\n**Justification for security risk score:** Given the static nature, a very low score is reasonable; no actual vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—static schema definitions, no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous assessments; static constants, SQL schema creation, no dynamic or untrusted data handling.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports agree the code is static and free of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero in one report (0.1), but justified due to the presence of SQL schema definitions, which are static and not directly exploitable in this context.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The code contains only schema definitions, constants, and views, which are typical for a data management system.\n- No dynamic execution, no external input handling, no code injection points.\n- The SQL queries are static strings, not concatenated with user input, reducing injection risk.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, justified by the presence of static SQL queries; no real security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.**",
