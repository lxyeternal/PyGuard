{
  "purpose": "A simple CLI script that outputs static greeting messages.",
  "sources": "The script reads no external input; it imports libraries and executes static print statements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; output is static and benign.",
  "flows": "Execution triggers static console output; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports only benign libraries (typer, rich.console) and defines a command that prints fixed messages. It does not process user input, handle secrets, or perform network operations. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these scores. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI greeting script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
