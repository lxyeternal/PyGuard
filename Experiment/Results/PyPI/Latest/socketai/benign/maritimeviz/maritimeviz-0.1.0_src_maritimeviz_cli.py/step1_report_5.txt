{
  "purpose": "A simple console script that outputs greeting messages and provides a link to the Typer documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the command line via the Typer library, but no external or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to the console using rich.console.Console.print(), which is safe and does not involve untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Input (command invocation) triggers execution of main(), which prints fixed strings to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution. No external data fetching or network activity. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script is a minimal Typer-based CLI that outputs static messages. It does not process user input beyond command invocation, nor does it perform any network, file, or environment operations. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks that handle such data, and no complex data flows. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign CLI script with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe to use and does not contain any malware or security issues.",
