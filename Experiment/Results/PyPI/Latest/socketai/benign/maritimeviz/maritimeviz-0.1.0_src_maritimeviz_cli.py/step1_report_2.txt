  "purpose": "A simple console script that uses Typer and Rich to display messages to the user.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input sources; it only executes local function calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only prints static messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'typer' and 'rich' libraries, creates a CLI app with Typer, and displays two static messages using Rich. There are no input reads, data processing, or network communications. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to typical CLI script patterns. No obfuscated code, malicious code, or security risks are evident. It appears to be a benign utility script intended for user interaction.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign CLI script that displays messages and has no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
