{
  "purpose": "A simple command-line interface script that prints greeting messages and references Typer documentation.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the command invocation from the user via the CLI, but no specific user input handling is present.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to the console using rich's Console.print(), which is benign in this context. No data sinks handling untrusted data or external communication.",
  "flows": "User runs the script, which executes main(), printing predefined messages to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. The script is straightforward, using standard libraries with no malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a CLI application with Typer, providing a single command that prints static greeting messages. It imports only benign libraries, with no external network communication, no input parsing beyond the command trigger, and no hidden behaviors. The structure is simple and consistent with standard CLI scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI tool with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs basic output tasks without any suspicious actions.",
