  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward CLI script that prints static greeting messages.\n- No external input handling, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- Libraries used ('typer' and 'rich') are standard and benign.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- Security risk scores are also 0, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Consistency:\n- The code matches the descriptions: it defines a CLI app with a single command that prints static messages.\n- No evidence of malicious payloads, secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- The analysis and conclusions are consistent across reports.\n\n### Scoring Review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate; no security risks are evident.\n\n### Potential Issues:\n- No issues or flaws are identified in the reports.\n- The reasoning is sound and aligns with the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security vulnerabilities or risks.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign CLI greeting script with no signs of malware or security issues. The reports correctly reflect this assessment.",
