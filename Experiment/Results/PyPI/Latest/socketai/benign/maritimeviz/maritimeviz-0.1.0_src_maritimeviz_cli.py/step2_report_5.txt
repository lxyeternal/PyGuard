  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI script using Typer and Rich libraries.\n   - It defines a single command that prints static greeting messages.\n   - No user input processing, external data handling, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Report Analysis:**\n   - All reports uniformly describe the script as benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify that the script only outputs static messages and does not process untrusted data or perform external communications.\n   - The reasoning is consistent and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   \n   The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns:**\n   - No suspicious code, no hidden behaviors, no external dependencies that could be malicious.\n   - The use of standard libraries and static messages further supports a benign assessment.\n   - The reports do not overstate or understate the security posture.\n\n5. **Overall Justification:**\n   - The code and reports indicate a safe, benign CLI script.\n   - The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n\n6. **My Final Assessment:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n   - **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, harmless CLI greeting script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the package as safe.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; all scores are appropriate.",
