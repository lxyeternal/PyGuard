  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and compare them to the code.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code is a minimal CLI application using Typer and Rich.\n- It defines a single command `main()` that prints static greeting messages.\n- No user input processing, no network activity, no secrets, no obfuscated code.\n- All libraries used are standard and benign.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and matches the descriptions in all reports.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no security issues, no malicious payloads, and no obfuscation. Their reasoning is sound.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk):**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Since the code only outputs static messages, there's no malware. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is clear and straightforward, so 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Given the absence of vulnerabilities, secrets, or malicious code, a risk score of 0 is correct.\n\n- **Sources and sinks:**  \n  The reports correctly identify that no untrusted data is handled, and outputs are benign.\n\n- **Flow analysis:**  \n  The flow is simple: script execution triggers static output. No issues here.\n\n- **Anomalies:**  \n  No anomalies are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign CLI greeting script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are correct. The code is straightforward, with no malicious or obfuscated components, and carries no security risk. The assigned scores are justified and should remain at zero across all categories.",
