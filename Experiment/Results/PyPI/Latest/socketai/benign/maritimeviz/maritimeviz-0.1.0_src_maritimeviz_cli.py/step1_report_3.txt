  "purpose": "A simple console script for maritimeviz that prints greeting messages.",
  "sources": "Reading the script execution entry point (__name__ == '__main__'), and the 'console.print' method calls.",
  "sinks": "console.print method calls, which output to the console.",
  "flows": "Script starts at main() when executed; outputs messages via console.print.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious imports or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'typer' and 'rich.console', creates a command-line app, and defines a main function that prints greeting messages. The script runs the main() function if executed directly. There are no user inputs, no network operations, no data leaks, no secrets, and no obfuscated code. The use of these libraries is typical for CLI applications. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI greeting script with no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscation. It simply outputs predefined messages when executed.",
