{
  "purpose": "A simple console script that uses Typer and Rich libraries to display greeting messages.",
  "sources": "Reads no external input or untrusted data; uses standard library imports and fixed strings.",
  "sinks": "Outputs fixed strings to the console; no untrusted data or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; only static messages are printed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, minimal, and uses standard libraries without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'typer' and 'rich.console', initializes a Typer app and console object, then defines a command 'main' that prints static greeting messages. It does not read input, connect to network, or handle untrusted data. The structure is typical for a CLI app with no hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic CLI greeting script with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data or perform any harmful operations.",
