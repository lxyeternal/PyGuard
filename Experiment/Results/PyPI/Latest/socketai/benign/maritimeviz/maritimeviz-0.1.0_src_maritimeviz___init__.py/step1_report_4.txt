  "purpose": "Initialize the top-level package for MaritimeViz with logging configuration and metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement for logging; assignment of logger configuration; metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __version__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; no external data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be standard package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the standard logging module, sets up a package-wide logger at DEBUG level, and defines metadata variables such as author, email, and version. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, external data processing, or suspicious behaviors. The structure is typical for a Python package initialization script. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package initialization with standard logging setup and metadata declaration. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
