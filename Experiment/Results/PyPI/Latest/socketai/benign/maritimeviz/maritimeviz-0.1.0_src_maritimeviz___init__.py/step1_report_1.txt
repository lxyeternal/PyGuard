{
  "purpose": "Set up package metadata and logging configuration for the MaritimeViz project.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (__author__, __email__, __version__) and configures logging via logging.getLogger() and setLevel().",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for a Python package __init__.py file, with no unusual or suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets (other than author info and email), or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes package metadata and configures a logger at DEBUG level. It imports only the logging module, sets up a logger, and assigns metadata variables. No data input, external connections, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package's entry point.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to set up package metadata and logging. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
