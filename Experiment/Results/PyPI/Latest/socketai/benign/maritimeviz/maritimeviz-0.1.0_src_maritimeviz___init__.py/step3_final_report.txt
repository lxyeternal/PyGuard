  "purpose": "Package initialization script setting up logging and metadata for the Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines metadata variables and configures a logger.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external sinks are present; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code solely sets up internal configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py that imports logging, sets up a logger at DEBUG level, and defines package metadata. It contains no external data handling, network communication, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs. The logger configuration at DEBUG level is typical during development but not inherently malicious. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate a benign, standard package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard package initialization script with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with its content, and no modifications are necessary.",
