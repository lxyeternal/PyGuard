  "purpose": "Initialize package with logging configuration and metadata information.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata (__author__, __email__, __version__), and configuring logging.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data output or network communication present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets beyond author info and email, which are standard metadata. No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated segments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module, sets up a logger, and assigns package metadata variables. No user input, network communication, or data leakage occurs. The code is straightforward and standard for Python packages. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident. The metadata fields are typical and do not pose risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely boilerplate for package initialization and metadata. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and normal.",
