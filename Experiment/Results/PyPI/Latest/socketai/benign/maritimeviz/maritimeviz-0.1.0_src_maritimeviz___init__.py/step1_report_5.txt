  "purpose": "Initialize the MaritimeViz package and configure a logger for debugging and informational output.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; only package metadata and logger configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external output operations present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow involving untrusted sources or sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code contains standard package setup and logger configuration with no suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata (__author__, __email__, __version__) and sets up a logger with DEBUG level. No external data inputs, environment variables, or sensitive data handling observed. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated logic, or malicious behaviors are present. The logger configuration is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be a typical package initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks. It simply configures package metadata and a logger for development purposes.",
