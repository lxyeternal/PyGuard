{
  "purpose": "This code provides a visualization module for AIS ship data, allowing users to plot vessel positions, routes, heatmaps, and base stations on interactive maps using Folium and Leafmap.",
  "sources": "GeoJSON data inputs, WKT polygon inputs, map initialization, and user-provided parameters such as layer names and filters.",
  "sinks": "Map rendering and marker/pop-up creation; no external data sinks or network actions are directly present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (geojson_data, wkt_polygon, parameters) through verification and processing functions, then to map visualization functions that generate markers, polygons, lines, and legends.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls. Use of external visualization libraries appears standard. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code thoroughly verifies GeoJSON data with verify_geojson(), uses standard Folium map features, and creates visualizations without any apparent malicious payloads. Functions are used to filter and display data in a typical GIS context. There are no network calls, data exfiltration, or file system modifications. The code focuses on visualization and spatial filtering, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It relies on standard open-source libraries for mapping and spatial data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate visualization module for AIS ship data, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses common GIS libraries and standard techniques for data filtering and map rendering. No malicious intent or malware signals are detected.",
