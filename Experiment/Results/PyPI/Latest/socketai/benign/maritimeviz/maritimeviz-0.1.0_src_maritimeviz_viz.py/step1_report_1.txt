{
  "purpose": "The code provides a visualization module for displaying AIS ship data on interactive maps using Folium and Leafmap, including features like heatmaps, ship routes, polygons, base stations, and filtering by MMSI.",
  "sources": "Data inputs from geojson_data parameters, user-defined WKT polygons, and environment variables (if any are used indirectly).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; map rendering functions do not perform data leaks or network communications, and no data exfiltration or malicious API calls are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (geojson_data, wkt_polygon, mmsi) through verification functions, filtering, and then into map markers, polygons, or lines for visualization. No external untrusted sinks are connected or exploited.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code structure and naming are consistent with standard visualization practices. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or code injection patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The module imports standard mapping and geospatial libraries, performs geojson validation, and creates various map layers for visualization. It filters data based on polygon containment and MMSI, assigns colors based on ship speed, and adds markers, lines, and heatmaps. The functions handle exceptions for invalid geometries and missing data gracefully. There are no indications of malicious behavior, external data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. The code relies on external, benign utility functions for verification and info extraction, with no evident malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate visualization tool with no embedded malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard geospatial visualization module for AIS data with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It performs data filtering and visualization tasks securely without suspicious code patterns or external malicious communications.",
