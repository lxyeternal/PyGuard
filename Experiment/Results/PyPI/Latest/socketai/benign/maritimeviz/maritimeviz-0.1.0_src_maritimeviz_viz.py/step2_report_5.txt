  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code to verify the claims, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Correctly states that the code visualizes AIS data, with data flowing through verification functions (`verify_geojson`) and into map layers. The description matches the code structure.\n\n- **Malware & Anomalies:** The report asserts no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward, relying on standard libraries, with no network activity or external malicious calls.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that the code is benign aligns with the code review. The confidence level (0.9) is reasonable.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate; no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly describes the data flow, including filtering and visualization.\n\n- **Malware & Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation. External libraries are standard, and no external network calls are observed.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that the code is benign is justified; confidence is high (1).\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Accurately describes the functions, including filtering by MMSI, polygons, and visualization steps.\n\n- **Malware & Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation detected. The code uses standard practices, with exception handling for WKT parsing.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that the code is legitimate and safe is well-founded; confidence 0.95 is justified.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Correctly describes the visualization functions, data inputs, and processing.\n\n- **Malware & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior identified. The use of utility functions appears benign.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment aligns with the code's structure; confidence 0.9 is reasonable.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Accurately summarizes the visualization functionalities and data handling.\n\n- **Malware & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The code relies on external libraries and utility functions that seem standard.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report's conclusion of benign behavior is justified; confidence 0.9.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 is suitable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and based on the code review, this is correct. The code performs data visualization with no malicious payloads, external communications, or suspicious code constructs.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities, malware, or suspicious behavior, a low risk score (around 0.1 to 0.2) is justified. Some reports assign 0.1 or 0.2, which seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (minimal security risk, mainly due to reliance on external utility functions whose safety is assumed)\n\n**Note:** The utility functions (`verify_geojson`, `check_printable_icon`, `get_info`, `create_speed_legend`) are assumed benign, as their names suggest standard data validation and info extraction, and no evidence indicates otherwise.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard geospatial visualization module for AIS data with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
