{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization functionalities for AIS ship data, including mapping ship routes, heatmaps, base stations, and filtering ships by polygons or MMSI.",
  "sources": "GeoJSON data inputs, WKT polygon strings, and optional filtering parameters such as MMSI or station IDs.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; all data is used only for visualization purposes within the map context.",
  "flows": "Input data (geojson, WKT strings) flows through verify_geojson and loads functions, then to visualization functions where data is used for plotting markers, polygons, lines, and heatmaps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code uses standard mapping libraries and functions. There is some reliance on external utility functions (verify_geojson, check_printable_icon, get_info, create_speed_legend) which are assumed safe.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several mapping libraries and utility functions, then defines a Map class with multiple methods for visualizing ship data. These methods process geojson inputs, filter or select data based on parameters, and add various map layers such as markers, lines, polygons, and heatmaps. The methods include data validation steps, such as verifying geojson and handling potential exceptions when loading WKT polygons. There are no indications of malicious code, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or file system manipulations are present beyond visualization. The overall structure is straightforward, relying on standard mapping library features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard visualization module for ship data, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. It performs mapping tasks safely, relying on external utility functions presumed safe. No suspicious activities or security risks are identified. It appears to be a legitimate, benign module for geographic visualization.",
