  "purpose": "A Python module for visualizing AIS ship data using interactive maps with options for routes, heatmaps, base stations, and filtered ship positions.",
  "sources": "Data inputs from verify_geojson utility, map interaction functions, and external utility functions for data verification and info extraction.",
  "sinks": "Visualization layers added to the map; no external network calls or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "GeoJSON data verified and processed into GeoDataFrames, filtered or mapped, then visualized via folium markers, polygons, lines, and heatmaps.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or external malicious calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard GIS visualization libraries and utility functions presumed safe. It processes input data, filters or visualizes it, and adds layers to an interactive map. No external network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. Utility functions like verify_geojson and get_info are assumed benign based on their naming and usage. The code structure is clear, with no suspicious constructs or external dependencies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured GIS visualization module for AIS data, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concerns primarily related to external utility functions. The overall assessment indicates a safe and benign codebase.",
