  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring consistency in scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** The code is a geospatial visualization module for AIS data, with no external or malicious data sinks. Data flows are confined to data verification, filtering, and visualization.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or external calls. The functions rely on external utilities, but their names suggest benign operations.\n\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The report concludes no malicious activity, with a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0.1, which seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues detected. The scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard visualization with trusted libraries. No external network activity or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, credentials, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, security risk 0, consistent with the benign assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** The code visualizes ship data with filtering, polygons, and heatmaps. Data verification and filtering are standard.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscated code, suspicious constructs, or external malicious calls. Utility functions are assumed benign.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2. The security risk is slightly higher but still low, reflecting the benign code.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Standard visualization tasks with no external data leaks or network activity.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code. Uses standard libraries.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to previous reports, with safe data handling and visualization.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external communication.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1. Consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is consistent with the detailed analysis. No malicious code, external calls, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the clear, straightforward code review.\n\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports (up to 0.2), reflecting minimal concerns primarily due to reliance on external utility functions and the potential for misconfiguration, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified.\n\n---\n\n### My final estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Security risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — very low, reflecting standard risks associated with external dependencies and data validation, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, and the code appears safe and legitimate. No modifications to scores are necessary based on the provided analysis.",
