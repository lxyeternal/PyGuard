{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for visualizing ship positions, filtering ships within polygons, and interactive map features such as drawing polygons and clicking to identify ships within a radius.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from GeoJSON files or objects, WKT polygon strings, and user interactions via map clicks.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include map layers, HTML popups, and console print statements; no direct data leaks or external network communications are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs (geojson, map clicks) through filtering and processing functions, resulting in map updates and visual overlays.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses standard libraries for geospatial processing and mapping.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical geospatial filtering, map visualization, and user interaction handling without any signs of malicious activity. It does not send data over the network, connect to suspicious domains, or execute hidden commands. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present. The functions utilize well-known open-source libraries for mapping and geospatial analysis, with proper handling of data and user events. No hardcoded secrets or unsafe operations are evident. The code's behavior aligns with legitimate geospatial visualization and user interaction use cases.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate geospatial visualization script with interactive map features. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It safely performs filtering, map rendering, and user interaction handling without external communications or hidden functionalities.",
