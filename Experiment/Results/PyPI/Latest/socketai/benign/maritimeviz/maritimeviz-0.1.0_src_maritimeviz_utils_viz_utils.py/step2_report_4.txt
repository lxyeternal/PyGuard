  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The code is for maritime data visualization, filtering ships within polygons, creating map overlays, and handling user interactions. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or network activity. Uses standard libraries correctly.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both are 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Low (0.1).\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies no malicious or obfuscated code, and the low security risk aligns with the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1—geospatial filtering, visualization, user interaction. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Uses standard libraries, no network activity.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher but still low (0.2), possibly due to cautious language.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment appears reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Focused on geospatial analysis and visualization. No malicious activity, network connections, or obfuscation detected. Popups and interactions are typical.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher but still minimal (0.2).\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent with the code’s behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above—standard geospatial visualization. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2, aligned with the cautious approach.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Also for geospatial visualization and interaction. No suspicious behaviors, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low (0.1).\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code contains no signs of malicious activity—no network connections, no code injection, no suspicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard libraries without obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), but all are very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a legitimate geospatial visualization tool for maritime data, with no malicious intent.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores given in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** (very low, as the code handles user data and visualization without external network communication or security concerns)\n\n**Summary:** The code appears safe, legitimate, and well within secure practices for geospatial data visualization.",
