  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims with the provided code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code appears to be a typical geospatial visualization and filtering tool for maritime data.\n- It uses well-known open-source libraries (folium, geopandas, shapely, geopy, ipyleaflet).\n- No hardcoded credentials, network communications, or obfuscated code are present.\n- Functions perform expected tasks: filtering, visualization, user interaction handling.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:** Legitimate maritime visualization code, no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The reasoning is sound; the code is standard and safe.\n- The security risk score is low, reflecting minimal concern.\n- Malware score is correctly zero.\n- Obfuscation is correctly zero.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard geospatial visualization with no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The reasoning aligns with the code.\n- Slightly higher securityRisk (0.2) is acceptable, perhaps reflecting cautiousness but still reasonable.\n- Malware remains zero, obfuscation zero.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:** Again, standard geospatial functions, no malicious behavior, no network activity.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The analysis correctly identifies the code as legitimate.\n- The security risk score is slightly higher but still low, justified by the potential exposure via popups, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** **Appropriate.** No changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:** Similar to above; no malicious activity, standard functions.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The reasoning is consistent.\n- The security risk remains low; no external communications or malicious payloads are evident.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:** Focuses on data processing and visualization, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.0\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The reasoning is solid; the code is straightforward and safe.\n- The security risk is minimal, given no external data leaks or network activity.\n\n**Verdict:** **Correct.** No changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) across reports, reflecting cautious but justified concern. Given the code's nature, these are reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** High (mostly 0.9 to 1.0), justified by the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, mostly due to potential popup content exposure if untrusted data is used, but overall very low.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are consistent with the code's actual behavior. No suspicious or malicious elements are detected. The scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Proceed with confidence that the code is safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.",
