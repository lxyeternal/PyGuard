  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'sdswrapper' for spatial data science workflows.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no execution of external commands or handling of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The code reads a local file for description; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The script follows standard setup practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard packaging functions, reads a local README file, and defines package metadata and dependencies. It does not process untrusted input or execute external commands. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The use of 'open' to read a local file is typical in setup scripts. All dependencies are standard Python packages without malicious signatures. No hidden or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It functions as a standard Python package setup configuration.",
