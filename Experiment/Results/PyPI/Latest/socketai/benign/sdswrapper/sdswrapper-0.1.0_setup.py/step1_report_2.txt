  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'sdswrapper' used for spatial data science workflows.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data or external data manipulation present.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' -> use in package setup; no malicious flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of standard setup tools and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for packaging, reads the 'README.md' file for the long description, and defines package metadata and dependencies. All components are typical for Python package setup scripts. No external data inputs, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The dependencies listed are common scientific packages. No malicious code or behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign package configuration.",
