  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'sdswrapper' intended for spatial data science workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from the script itself and from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script performs standard package setup operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; straightforward package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present. Uses standard 'setuptools' methods without dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code uses 'setuptools' to define package metadata and dependencies, which is typical for Python packages. It reads 'README.md' for long description, a common practice. No user input, external untrusted data, or dynamic code execution is present. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or anomalies detected. All dependencies are standard packages for data science workflows. No suspicious patterns or signals of malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
