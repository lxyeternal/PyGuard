{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'sdswrapper', intended for spatial data science workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, description from 'README.md', and dependencies listed in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; standard setup script does not include data handling or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A – standard setup process with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open('README.md').read() without sanitization; however, this is a common practice in setup scripts and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python package setup configuration utilizing setuptools. It imports 'setup' and 'find_packages', then calls 'setup' with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No input data is processed beyond reading a markdown file for description. No code execution, network activity, or dynamic behaviors are present. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. The only potentially noteworthy aspect is reading 'README.md' directly, which is standard and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
