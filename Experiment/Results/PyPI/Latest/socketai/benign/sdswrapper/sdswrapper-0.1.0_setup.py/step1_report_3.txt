  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for a Python package named 'sdswrapper'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data output or execution points.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only sets up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It imports setup tools, reads a markdown file for description, specifies dependencies, and package metadata. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution is present. The dependencies listed are common scientific libraries with no suspicious or malicious features. The script is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies.",
