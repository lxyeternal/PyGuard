  "purpose": "A standard Python package setup script for 'sdswrapper' using setuptools, defining metadata, dependencies, and reading the README file.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Reading local file 'README.md' and setting package metadata; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code follows typical setup.py structure with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script that imports setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers, and reads a local README file. It contains no dynamic code execution, network calls, obfuscated code, or hardcoded credentials. Dependencies are common data science packages. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code adheres to standard practices and is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, and confidence is high.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
