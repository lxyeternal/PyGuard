  "purpose": "Re-export functions set_chinese_font and test_plot from the local font_manager module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .font_manager module",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external outputs",
  "flows": "Importing functions into the package namespace",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import, no suspicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple __init__.py file that imports specific functions from a local module. It serves to expose these functions at the package level, facilitating their use elsewhere. There are no data flows, external communications, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The functions imported are related to font management and plotting, which are typical for this context. The code is syntactically correct, minimal, and does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could be malicious. All indicators point to benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initializer with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The import statement is standard and does not pose any threat. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence in this assessment.",
