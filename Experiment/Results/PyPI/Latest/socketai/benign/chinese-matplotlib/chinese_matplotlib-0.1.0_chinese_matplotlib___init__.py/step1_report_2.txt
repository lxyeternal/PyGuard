  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code snippet",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or untrusted data handling observed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated code detected. The functions imported ('set_chinese_font', 'test_plot') are typical for customizing plots and testing fonts.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports two functions from a submodule within the package. No input/output, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior are present. The functions' names suggest legitimate purposes related to font handling and testing, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward package initialization script that imports functions related to font management. No malicious or security concerns are evident based on this code snippet.",
