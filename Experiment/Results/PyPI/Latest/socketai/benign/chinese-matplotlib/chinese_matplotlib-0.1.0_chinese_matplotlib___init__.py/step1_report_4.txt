  "purpose": "Re-exporting functions 'set_chinese_font' and 'test_plot' from the 'font_manager' module for use in the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement that loads functions from another module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The import allows other parts of the package or external code to invoke the imported functions, but no direct data flow or untrusted data handling is evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local module 'font_manager'. It serves as an initializer to expose these functions at the package level. There are no inputs, network operations, or data manipulations present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks are visible within this short snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple package initializer that re-exports functions for convenience. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
