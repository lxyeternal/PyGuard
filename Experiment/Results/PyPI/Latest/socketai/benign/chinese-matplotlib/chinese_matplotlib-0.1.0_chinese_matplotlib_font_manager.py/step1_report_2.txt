  "purpose": "This code manages Chinese font loading, caching, downloading, and setting for matplotlib plots.",
  "sources": "Reading font cache file (~/.cache/chinese_matplotlib/font_cache.json), checking system fonts, downloading font zip from GitHub URL, extracting font files.",
  "sinks": "Downloading font zip and saving to local disk, adding font files to matplotlib's font manager, updating rcParams, saving cache file.",
  "flows": "Code reads cache to get font info → scans system fonts → downloads font zip if needed → extracts and adds fonts to matplotlib → updates configuration and cache.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Download URL is a public source. No obfuscated code or misleading variables. No use of eval, exec, or insecure input handling.",
  "analysis": "The code loads and saves font cache, scans available system fonts, downloads and installs Source Han Sans SC font from a GitHub URL if needed, and sets a font for matplotlib. The download URL is a standard open-source font repository, and font files are extracted and registered with matplotlib. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system damage. The only external network request is to a known font source, and the files are stored locally. No suspicious or harmful activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs legitimate font management tasks for matplotlib with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code. It securely handles font files and caches font choices. The overall security risk is low.",
