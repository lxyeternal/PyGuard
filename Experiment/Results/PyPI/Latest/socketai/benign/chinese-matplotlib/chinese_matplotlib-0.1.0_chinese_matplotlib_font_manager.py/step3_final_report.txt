  "purpose": "Manage Chinese fonts for matplotlib by detecting system fonts, caching choices, downloading Source Han Sans SC if needed, and registering fonts for display.",
  "sources": "Reads font cache file, system font list, and downloads font ZIP from GitHub URL.",
  "sinks": "Sets matplotlib font parameters, registers font files with font_manager, writes cache file.",
  "flows": "Checks cache -> system fonts -> downloads font archive -> extracts fonts -> registers fonts -> updates cache.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; external download from reputable source.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard font management tasks: caching font choice, detecting available fonts, downloading and extracting open-source font files, and registering them with matplotlib. All external interactions are with a known, trusted source. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The download URL is a legitimate source for open-source fonts, and the operations are straightforward. The risk mainly involves external resource fetching, which is minimal and justified given the source. No signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious payloads are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing Chinese fonts in matplotlib. It performs legitimate operations with no malicious intent or behavior. The scores assigned in the reports—malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, low risk (~0.1-0.2)—are accurate and consistent with the code's functionality. No modifications are necessary.",
