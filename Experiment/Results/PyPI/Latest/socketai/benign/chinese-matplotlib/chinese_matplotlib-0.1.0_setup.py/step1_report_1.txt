  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for packaging the Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports and calls a function from a standard library.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; the script does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs; the setup() function is called without parameters, performing a standard setup process.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. The script is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'setup' function from setuptools and calls it with default parameters. It is a minimal setup script commonly used for Python packaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or obfuscation. It does not contain any code that could lead to security vulnerabilities or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs a typical package configuration step without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
