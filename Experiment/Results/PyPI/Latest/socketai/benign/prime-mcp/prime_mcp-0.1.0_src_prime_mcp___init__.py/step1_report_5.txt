{
  "purpose": "To run the main asynchronous server function in an event loop.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read directly in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially risky operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code simply calls asyncio.run() with server.main(), which executes the server's main function asynchronously.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports asyncio and a local server module, then defines a main() function that runs server.main() asynchronously. The __all__ declaration exposes 'main' and 'server'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious logic. The code's simplicity reduces risk, and it does not perform any network activity or data handling on its own.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for running an async server main function. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign and intentionally designed to start a server process.",
