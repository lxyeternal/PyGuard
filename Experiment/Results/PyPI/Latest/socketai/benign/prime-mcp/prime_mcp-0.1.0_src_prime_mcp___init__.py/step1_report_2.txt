{
  "purpose": "Defines a main entry point for a Python application that runs an asynchronous server module.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'asyncio' module and a local 'server' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code calls 'asyncio.run' on 'server.main()'.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules to executing 'server.main()' asynchronously.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports asyncio for asynchronous operations and a local server module. The main() function calls asyncio.run on server.main(), indicating that server.main() is an asynchronous function. The code only sets up and executes this function, with no data processing, input handling, or network connections visible. The __all__ declaration specifies exported symbols. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a simple entry point to run an asynchronous server. It appears benign, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
