{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point to run an asynchronous server module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports a local module and runs its main() function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted data or output data directly.",
  "flows": "The code calls server.main() within asyncio.run(), which is the flow from script execution to server startup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports asyncio and a local server module, then defines a main() function that runs server.main() asynchronously. The __all__ declaration exposes main and server for external use. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code appears to be a standard application bootstrap.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate script to run an asynchronous server. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
