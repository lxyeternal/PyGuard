{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a simple entry point that runs an asynchronous server main function.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'asyncio' module and a local 'server' module. The 'main()' function calls 'server.main()' using asyncio.run().",
  "sinks": "The 'asyncio.run(server.main())' could be a sink if 'server.main()' executes untrusted code or receives untrusted input, but in this context, it is likely just starting the server.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: the 'main()' function triggers 'server.main()' via asyncio.run(), which is the only dynamic call. There are no other input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is minimal and typical for an async application entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code imports asyncio and a local server module, then defines a main() function that runs 'server.main()' asynchronously. The code only exposes 'main' and 'server' via __all__, which is standard practice. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or suspicious constructs. The structure suggests a typical server application start script. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard entry point for an asynchronous server application. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
