  "purpose": "Entry point script that initializes and runs the server asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Import of asyncio module and local server module; invocation of server.main() within asyncio.run().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The main() function calls server.main() asynchronously, with no data flow outside this call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard async server startup script. It imports asyncio and a local server module, then defines main() which runs server.main() asynchronously. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. The implementation is typical for such scripts, and the only uncertainty relates to the internal behavior of server.main(), which cannot be assessed here. The code itself is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard async server entry point with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (around 0.1) reflecting uncertainty about server.main(). No modifications are necessary.",
