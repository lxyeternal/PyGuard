  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, hardcoded strings, network calls, dynamic code execution functions (eval, exec), imported modules, suspicious network addresses.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, subprocesses, file writes, environment variables, external modules, system commands.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables or hardcoded data flows into network communication, subprocesses, or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, obfuscated variable names, unprotected environment variables, hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, dynamic code execution, high obfuscation levels.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation, dynamic execution, and suspicious network activity. Use of risky functions like eval/exec and hardcoded tokens suggests potential malicious intent. The obfuscation level is high, and data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks, indicating possible exfiltration or remote code execution. The suspicion is moderate to high based on these indicators, but definitive malicious payloads are not confirmed. The overall security risk is elevated due to these red flags, warranting cautious handling and further analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows multiple signs of obfuscation and potential malicious behavior, including dynamic code execution and suspicious network activity. While no definitive malicious payload is confirmed, the risk level is significant enough to warrant further investigation. The malware score is set at 0.75, obfuscation at 0.8, and security risk at 0.85, reflecting high suspicion but not absolute certainty.",
