  "conclusion": "The code shows multiple signs of obfuscation and potential malicious behavior, including dynamic code execution and suspicious network activity. While no definitive malicious payload is confirmed, the risk level is significant enough to warrant further investigation. The malware score is set at 0.75, obfuscation at 0.8, and security risk at 0.85, reflecting high suspicion but not absolute certainty."
