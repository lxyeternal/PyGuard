{
  "purpose": "Load and validate static JSON data files ('recommendation.json' and 'summary.json') from local resources, and expose functions via FastMCP for issue summaries and recommendations.",
  "sources": "Reading JSON files from filesystem ('recommendation.json' and 'summary.json') using open(), then parsing with json.load().",
  "sinks": "Validation with Pydantic models ensures data integrity; no sinks for untrusted data or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "Filesystem read -> json.load -> model_validate -> return validated data; used within async functions exposed as MCP tools.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard library usage, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code loads static JSON files from local disk, validates them with Pydantic models, caches the results with lru_cache, and exposes async functions via FastMCP. No external network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. Validation mitigates risks from malformed data. The structure is clean and standard, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent. The JSON files themselves could be malicious if tampered, but the code's validation reduces this risk. Overall, the code is benign, with minimal security concerns, primarily related to static data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and performs static data loading and validation without malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
