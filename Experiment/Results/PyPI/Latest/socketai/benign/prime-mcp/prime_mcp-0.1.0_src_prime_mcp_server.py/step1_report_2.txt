{
  "purpose": "The code loads JSON data from local resource files and provides functions to retrieve issue summaries and recommendations through a FastMCP server interface.",
  "sources": "Reading data from local files: RECOMMENDATIONS and SUMMARY, via open() calls within load_recommendations() and load_summary().",
  "sinks": "None that lead to potential data leaks or insecure operations. No external network or system commands are executed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local JSON files into Python data structures, then via functions decorated as MCP tools, but no untrusted input is processed or transmitted externally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. Use of caching functions is normal. No dynamic code execution or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The script loads configuration data from local JSON files and validates the data against Pydantic models. Functions are decorated for a FastMCP server but do not process untrusted input directly. The code appears well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, credential theft, or backdoors. The only external interactions are reading local resource files, which are static and controlled. The use of caching optimizes repeated loads but does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily performing local data loading and validation. There are no indications of malicious intent, security flaws, or supply chain attacks in this code fragment.",
