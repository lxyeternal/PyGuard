{
  "purpose": "The code loads and caches JSON data into data models and defines an async main function to set up a tool with the FastMCP framework for issue summarization and recommendations.",
  "sources": "Reading JSON files ('recommendation.json' and 'summary.json') from the filesystem",
  "sinks": "Returning validated data models, printing outputs, and setting up tool functions",
  "flows": "Filesystem reads (load_recommendations, load_summary) -> Data validation -> Return data models -> Print statements -> Tool functions for issue summary and recommendations",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python libraries and well-defined third-party libraries (pydantic, FastMCP). JSON files are loaded securely with validation. The use of @lru_cache is appropriate for caching static data. No signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or covert channels. The print statements are benign debugging outputs. The overall structure and code logic appear legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate data loading, validation, and setup for a tool-based application without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, and no suspicious activity is evident.",
