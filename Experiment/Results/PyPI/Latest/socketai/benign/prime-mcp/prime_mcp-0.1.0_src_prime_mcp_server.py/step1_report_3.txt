{
  "purpose": "The code loads JSON data from files, validates it using Pydantic models, and defines asynchronous functions for issue summarization and recommendations within a FastMCP framework.",
  "sources": "Reading JSON files ('recommendation.json' and 'summary.json') from the filesystem",
  "sinks": "The code loads data into models; no direct sinks for untrusted input are evident; print statements output data but do not leak sensitive information over the network",
  "flows": "Filesystem read (load_recommendations/load_summary) -> JSON parsing -> Data validation -> Usage in functions (issue_summary, recommendations)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of LRU cache for loaded data is standard and not suspicious. No external network calls or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code securely reads data from local JSON files, validates data using Pydantic models, and defines API-like functions for processing issue summaries and recommendations. No untrusted input handling beyond local files, no data leaks, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward data loading and API definition module with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs data validation and caching appropriately, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.",
