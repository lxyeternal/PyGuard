  "purpose": "Define data models for issue tracking, descriptions, stakeholders, locations, concerns, and recommendations using Pydantic for data validation.",
  "sources": "All class and field definitions, particularly input fields in models, e.g., description, pattern in IssueID, and optional fields.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not contain any data output, network, or system interaction points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input fields in models to stored objects; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual logic; the pattern in IssueID is a standard regex for issue IDs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple Pydantic models for structured data handling related to issues and related attributes. The IssueID field uses a regex pattern to validate issue identifiers, which is a standard validation approach. No network operations, file I/O, or dynamic code execution is present. All fields are used for data validation and structure, with no suspicious logic, data leakage, or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of data models for issue tracking and management, with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated/malicious code. It appears to be safe for use in a secure environment.",
