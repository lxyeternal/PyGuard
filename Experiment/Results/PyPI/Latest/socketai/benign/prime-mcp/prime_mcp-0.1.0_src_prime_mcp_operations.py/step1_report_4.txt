  "purpose": "Defines data models using Pydantic for issue tracking, documentation, and security concerns.",
  "sources": "Python standard library (typing), Pydantic library, annotations for type and field validation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted data or perform insecure operations; primarily data structure definitions.",
  "flows": "Data is defined in models; no data flow or execution of untrusted input is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of annotated string pattern for 'issue_id' is standard; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of Pydantic models for structured data validation and serialization, with fields and descriptions. The only notable pattern is a regex pattern for 'issue_id' validation. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The code's purpose is data modeling without operational or execution logic. All components appear standard and aligned with typical schema definitions. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of data models for issue tracking and documentation. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The pattern validation for 'issue_id' is safe and typical for input validation.",
