  "purpose": "Define data models for issue tracking, documentation, and risk management using Pydantic for data validation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; all models are static class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external output mechanisms; the code only defines data schemas.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or untrusted data paths; the models are purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The pattern for 'issue_id' is standard for issue tracking IDs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of class definitions inheriting from Pydantic's BaseModel, with fields annotated with types and optional descriptions. It includes various nested models for structured data representation related to issue tracking and risk management. There are no dynamic code execution, external data handling, network operations, or other suspicious behaviors. The pattern for 'issue_id' is consistent with common issue identifiers. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of data schema definitions intended for structured data validation and documentation within an issue management context. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
