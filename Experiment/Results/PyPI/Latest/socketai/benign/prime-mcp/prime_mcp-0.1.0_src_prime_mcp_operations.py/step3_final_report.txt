{
  "purpose": "Define structured data models for issue tracking, summaries, concerns, controls, and recommendations using Pydantic schemas.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with annotated fields, regex pattern validation for 'issue_id'.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data handling, external data input, or network operations; purely static schema definitions.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or dynamic execution; data validation occurs during model instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward schema definitions with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or embedded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Pydantic model classes with annotated fields, descriptions, and validation constraints. The 'IssueID' pattern enforces a standard issue identifier format. No executable logic, external data handling, or network activity is present. The code is static and declarative, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The pattern validation is standard, and no suspicious patterns are observed. The scores are consistent with the code's static, schema-only nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured set of data models for issue management, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
