  "purpose": "Minimal Python entry point that imports and executes 'main' from 'prime_mcp' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from prime_mcp import main', execution trigger in '__main__' block.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function, which depends on 'prime_mcp' implementation.",
  "flows": "Code flow from import to calling 'main()' when script runs directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python script that imports 'main' from 'prime_mcp' and executes it if run as the main program. Its security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'prime_mcp.main()'. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned by reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of this minimal code. The confidence levels are high, given the simplicity, but the overall security posture cannot be fully assessed without inspecting 'prime_mcp.main()'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and follows standard patterns. The security risk and malware scores are appropriate, assuming 'prime_mcp.main()' is safe. No evidence suggests malicious intent within this snippet. The primary concern hinges on the external module's content, which is outside the scope of this review.",
