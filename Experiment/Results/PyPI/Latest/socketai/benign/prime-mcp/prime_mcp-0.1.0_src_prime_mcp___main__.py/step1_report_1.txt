{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point that imports and executes the main function from the prime_mcp module.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from prime_mcp import main' reads the prime_mcp module; '__name__' and '__main__' are built-in variables used to determine execution context.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'main()' may execute untrusted code if the prime_mcp module or its main function contains malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "The flow depends entirely on the behavior of 'main()' in the prime_mcp module. The source (import and __name__ check) leads to executing 'main()', which is the sink.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. No apparent anomalies outside the import and main invocation pattern.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'main' from 'prime_mcp' and executes it if the script is run directly. The security analysis depends on the content of 'prime_mcp'. Since only this entry point is provided, there are no direct signs of malicious activity within this code snippet. However, executing 'main()' can be risky if 'prime_mcp' contains malicious code, but that cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard entry point that delegates execution to the 'main' function of an external module. Without inspecting 'prime_mcp', no malicious behavior can be confirmed or denied. The code itself appears benign and conventional.",
