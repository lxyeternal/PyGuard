{
  "purpose": "To invoke the main function from the prime_mcp module when executed as a script.",
  "sources": "The import statement importing 'main' from the 'prime_mcp' module; execution entry point '__main__' block.",
  "sinks": "None directly present; the code only calls 'main()' from the imported module.",
  "flows": "The script imports 'main' and calls it when executed; no data flow within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function 'main' from the 'prime_mcp' module and executes it if the script is run directly. There are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscated elements. The code itself is simple and standard for Python scripts that delegate execution to a main function in a module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malicious intent. It acts as a simple entry point to execute 'main()' from the 'prime_mcp' module. Without inspecting the 'prime_mcp' module itself, there are no indicators of malicious behavior within this snippet.",
