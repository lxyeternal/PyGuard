{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'main' function from the 'prime_mcp' module and executes it if the script is run as the main program.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly; it relies on the imported module and the execution context.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present in this snippet; potential malicious activity depends on the behavior of 'main' in 'prime_mcp'.",
  "flows": "There is no flow within this snippet itself; any data flow depends on 'main' and its internal implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are visible here.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple entry point script that imports and executes a function from an external module. The code itself does not contain any malicious patterns or suspicious behaviors. However, because the behavior depends entirely on the imported 'main' function from 'prime_mcp', which is not provided, potential security concerns are outside the scope of this snippet. The code structure adheres to common Python conventions and does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The potential for malicious activity or data leakage depends on the implementation of 'main' within 'prime_mcp'. As it stands, the code appears benign.",
