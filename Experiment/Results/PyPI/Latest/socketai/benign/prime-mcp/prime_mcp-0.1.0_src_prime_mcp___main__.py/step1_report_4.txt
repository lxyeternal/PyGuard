{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes the main function from the prime_mcp module, serving as an entry point for a larger program.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing main from prime_mcp; execution of main() in the main block.",
  "sinks": "The main() function could potentially contain sinks, but this cannot be determined from this code alone.",
  "flows": "Import from prime_mcp -> execution of main() if script is run directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple script that imports a main function from the prime_mcp module and executes it when run directly. It does not include any hardcoded credentials, network calls, or other suspicious behaviors. Since the actual behavior depends entirely on the implementation of prime_mcp.main(), which is not provided, there is no evidence of malicious activity in this snippet. The structure follows standard Python module execution patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears to be a typical entry point script that delegates execution to a function in another module. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risks based solely on this fragment. The potential security concerns depend entirely on the implementation details of prime_mcp.main().",
