  "conclusion": "The code is benign and follows standard patterns. The security risk and malware scores are appropriate, assuming 'prime_mcp.main()' is safe. No evidence suggests malicious intent within this snippet. The primary concern hinges on the external module's content, which is outside the scope of this review."
