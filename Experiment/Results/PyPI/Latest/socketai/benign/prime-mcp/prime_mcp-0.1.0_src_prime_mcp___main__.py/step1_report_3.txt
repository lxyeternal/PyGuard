{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point to execute the 'main' function from the 'prime_mcp' module, likely to run a specific process or calculation defined in that module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'prime_mcp' and calls its 'main' function when executed as a script.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly handle untrusted data or user input; it simply calls an imported function.",
  "flows": "The script initiates by importing 'main' from 'prime_mcp', then executes 'main()' when run as a script, with no data flow involving external input or output in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is minimal and standard in structure. No suspicious or unusual code constructs are used.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from an external module and executes it if the script is run directly. It is a common pattern for Python scripts. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. The security analysis relies on the content of 'prime_mcp', which is not provided here. Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python script entry point that calls an external module's main function. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this minimal code snippet.",
