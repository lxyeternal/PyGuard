      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard async server entry point with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (around 0.1) reflecting uncertainty about server.main(). No modifications are necessary."

No evidence suggests malicious intent within this snippet. The primary concern hinges on the external module's content, which is outside the scope of this review."

While no definitive malicious payload is confirmed, the risk level is significant enough to warrant further investigation. The malware score is set at 0.75, obfuscation at 0.8, and security risk at 0.85, reflecting high suspicion but not absolute certainty."
