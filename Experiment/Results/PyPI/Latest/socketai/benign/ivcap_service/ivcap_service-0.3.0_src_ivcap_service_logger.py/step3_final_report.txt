  "purpose": "Load and apply a JSON logging configuration from a file, defaulting to 'logging.json' in the script directory.",
  "sources": "Reading the JSON configuration file specified by 'cfg_path' or default path, and loading its content.",
  "sinks": "Applying the loaded configuration via dictConfig; no untrusted data flows or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "File read -> JSON parse -> global variable assignment -> dictConfig application.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward configuration loading. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard operation of reading a JSON configuration file and applying it to set up logging. It does not execute dynamic code, connect to networks, or handle sensitive data beyond configuration. The only security consideration is the trustworthiness of the JSON file, which could influence logging behavior if compromised. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The code's simplicity and clarity support a high confidence in its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign logging setup utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The main security concern is the external JSON configuration file’s integrity, which is a common and accepted risk in configuration management. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity and assign appropriate scores.",
