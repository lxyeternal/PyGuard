{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and configures logging for a Python application, loading logging configuration from a JSON file.",
  "sources": "Reading the logging configuration JSON file from a specified path or default 'logging.json' in the script directory.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; the code only loads configuration data and returns loggers.",
  "flows": "Reading the JSON configuration file flows into setting the global LOGGING_CONFIG and calling dictConfig to set up logging.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code performs standard logging setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to retrieve loggers and initialize logging based on a JSON configuration file. It reads the configuration file synchronously, loads it into a global variable, and applies it via dictConfig. No untrusted data handling beyond reading the config file is performed. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious payloads. The only potential concern is if an attacker controls the JSON config file, but this is typical for logging setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard logging setup code with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It safely loads a logging configuration and provides logger instances. No malware or security risks are identified.",
