{
  "purpose": "This code initializes logging configuration for an application, loading settings from a JSON file and providing logger instances.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration file from disk (cfg_path, default 'logging.json' in script directory)",
  "sinks": "Loading JSON configuration from file into global variable LOGGING_CONFIG",
  "flows": "Open and read configuration file -> load JSON -> update global LOGGING_CONFIG -> configure logging with dictConfig",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network activity",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard logging setup: it loads configuration from a JSON file, which can be specified or defaults to 'logging.json' in the script directory. It then applies the logging configuration using dictConfig. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. There are no hidden network calls, no code injection, and no data leaks. The code appears to be purely for logging setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging configuration loader with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely loads and applies logging settings from a JSON file, with no suspicious or malicious components.",
