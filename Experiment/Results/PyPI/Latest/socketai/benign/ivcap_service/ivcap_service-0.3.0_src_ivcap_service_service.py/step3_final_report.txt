{
  "purpose": "A batch processing worker that polls a remote server for jobs, processes them with a user-defined worker function, and reports results back.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET requests to fetch jobs, input data from job['in-content'], environment variables for configuration",
  "sinks": "Network requests to push results, sys.exit() for termination, logging outputs",
  "flows": "fetch_job() retrieves job data -> do_job() processes input with worker_fn -> verify_result() validates output -> push_result() sends back results",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard batch worker with robust error handling, exponential backoff retries, and external worker_fn invocation. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External dependencies like get_ivcap_url() and worker_fn are trust boundaries but are typical in plugin-based architectures. The exception handling and network interactions are standard and do not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured batch processing framework with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The external worker_fn introduces a trust boundary but does not impact the security assessment of this code snippet.",
