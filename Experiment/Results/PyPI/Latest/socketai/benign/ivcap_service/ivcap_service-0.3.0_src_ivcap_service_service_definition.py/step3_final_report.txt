  "purpose": "Generate service definitions for batch processing based on environment variables, external resource files, and function metadata, primarily for deployment configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (DOCKER_IMG, IVCAP_RESOURCES_FILE, IVCAP_SERVICE_NAME, IVCAP_SERVICE_ID, IVCAP_POLICY_URN), external resource JSON files, function's filename and docstring.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform data leaks, network access, or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and resource files feed into resource loading and configuration models, which are then assembled into service definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.exit() on resource file access failure; reliance on environment variables without explicit validation; external file loading without sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs service and controller schemas using data from environment variables, external JSON resource files, and function metadata. It performs file existence and readability checks, logs warnings or info, and terminates on failure. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The reliance on environment variables and external files is typical for deployment scripts but could be manipulated for misconfiguration. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. Use of sys.exit() is standard error handling, not malicious. External inputs are not sanitized, which could lead to misconfigurations but not malicious behavior. Overall, the code is a benign configuration utility with low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign configuration and schema generation utility for service deployment, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low risk score reflects potential misconfiguration risks but not malicious activity.",
