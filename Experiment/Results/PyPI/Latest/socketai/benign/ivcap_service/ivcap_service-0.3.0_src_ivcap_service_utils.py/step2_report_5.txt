  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Utility functions for:\n  - Inspecting function signatures (`_get_input_type`, `_get_function_return_type`)\n  - Reading JSON files (`file_to_json`)\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- Uses standard libraries (`inspect`, `json`, `os`, `re`, `pydantic`)\n- Proper error handling in `file_to_json`.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Observations:\n- The code performs static analysis and file reading in a safe manner.\n- No malicious behavior, no data exfiltration, no code injection.\n- The functions are typical for utility purposes, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Correctly states no malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also correctly identifies benign behavior.\n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.1), perhaps due to the file reading nature, but justified.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to above, consistent analysis.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still appropriate.\n- Malware: 0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same as above, consistent.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion, high confidence.\n- Malware: 0\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0 to 0.2, justified given the file operations but no malicious intent.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The functions are standard utilities with proper error handling.\n- The file reading operations do not process untrusted data in a dangerous way, and no network activity or code injection is present.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (slightly elevated due to file I/O, but justified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign utility code with no malicious or security risk indicators. The existing scores and analysis are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes are necessary; the reports are consistent with the code's behavior.",
