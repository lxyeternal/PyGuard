{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for inspecting function signatures, extracting type information, and reading JSON data from files.",
  "sources": "File path input in the function 'file_to_json'.",
  "sinks": "The 'file_to_json' function reads data from a file specified by the user, but does not process untrusted data in a way that leads to code execution or data leakage.",
  "flows": "User supplies 'file_path' -> 'file_to_json' reads and parses the file content -> returns parsed JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Use of 'inspect' and 'get_type_hints' is standard for reflection. Error handling is typical. No obfuscated code or dangerous dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles reflection on functions and reading JSON files. It includes standard error handling for file operations and JSON parsing. There are no indications of malicious intent such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The functions operate on user-provided input (file paths) but do not perform any unsafe or malicious operations. The use of 'inspect', 'json', and 'os' modules in this context is safe. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code's behavior aligns with legitimate utility functions, with no suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for reflection and file reading, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
