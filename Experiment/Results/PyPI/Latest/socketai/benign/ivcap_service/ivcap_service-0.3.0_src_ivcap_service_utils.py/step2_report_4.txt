  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the validity of their conclusions and scoring.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Utility functions for:\n  - Inspecting function signatures (`_get_input_type`, `_get_function_return_type`)\n  - Reading JSON files (`file_to_json`)\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code.\n- Uses standard libraries (`inspect`, `json`, `os`) safely.\n- Error handling is appropriate.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, benign usage of `inspect` and `json`.\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign, and the report's conclusion is accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions, file reading.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, just file existence check and JSON parsing.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** The slight risk score (0.1) seems reasonable given that it reads files that could contain untrusted JSON, but no malicious intent is detected. The malware score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, standard operations.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score, possibly due to the potential for reading untrusted files, but no actual malicious behavior. The malware score is correctly zero.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, standard code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous assessments. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same utility functions.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, proper handling.\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall analysis:\n- **Code behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code is utility-focused, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** All malware scores are zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low, reflecting the potential risk of reading untrusted files, but no actual exploitation or malicious activity.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's benign nature but potential for reading untrusted data, a small risk score (~0.1) is reasonable for some reports, but not higher unless malicious behavior is present.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for potential issues with untrusted JSON files, but no actual vulnerabilities)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is benign utility code with no malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Final note:** Always consider that reading untrusted files can pose security risks if used improperly, but the code itself is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects the benign nature of the code, with minimal potential risk due to untrusted input handling.",
