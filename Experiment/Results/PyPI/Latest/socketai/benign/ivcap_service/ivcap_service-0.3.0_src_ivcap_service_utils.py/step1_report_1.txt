  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for inspecting function signatures, extracting type hints, and reading JSON data from files.",
  "sources": "File path input in file_to_json function.",
  "sinks": "json.load() function reading from file; no other data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "file_path parameter -> file_to_json() -> open() -> json.load()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. The function only reads from a file and parses JSON; no external network or system modifications are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for introspection (getting input and return types of functions) and for reading JSON files. The file_to_json function performs a safe read operation with standard error handling, raising exceptions on invalid files or missing files. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or system modifications are present. The use of inspect and get_type_hints for function analysis is benign and standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be purely utility-based, with no malicious intent or security risks. It safely reads JSON files and inspects functions for their type annotations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
