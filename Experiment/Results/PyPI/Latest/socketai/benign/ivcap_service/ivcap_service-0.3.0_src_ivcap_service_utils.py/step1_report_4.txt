{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for inspecting function signatures, extracting type hints, and reading JSON data from files.",
  "sources": "File system access via os.path.exists and open() to read files.",
  "sinks": "json.load() reads data from files, potentially parsing untrusted content.",
  "flows": "File path input → open() → json.load() → returned data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Functions are straightforward. No dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs reflection on functions to extract parameter types and return types, and reads files for JSON content. It performs input validation on the file path with os.path.exists before reading. JSON parsing is standard. No code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity detected. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs. Use of standard libraries and straightforward logic reduces the likelihood of malicious intent. No anomalous patterns or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard utility module for introspection and file reading with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
