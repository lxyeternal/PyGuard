  "purpose": "Utility functions for introspection of function signatures and safe JSON file reading.",
  "sources": "File system (os.path.exists, open), function parameters (inspect.signature, get_type_hints)",
  "sinks": "json.load() reading from files, returning data structures",
  "flows": "file_to_json reads file -> parses JSON -> returns dictionary",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard libraries, no obfuscation or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs safe introspection and file reading operations with proper error handling. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The functions are utility in nature, with no signs of malicious intent or backdoors. The JSON reading is standard and does not process untrusted data maliciously. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to file I/O, which is typical for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are accurate and appropriate given the code's functionality.",
