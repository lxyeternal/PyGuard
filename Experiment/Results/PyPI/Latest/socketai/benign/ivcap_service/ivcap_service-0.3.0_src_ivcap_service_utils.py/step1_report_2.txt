  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for inspecting function signatures and reading JSON files.",
  "sources": "File path input in file_to_json function",
  "sinks": "json.load() reading from file, access to file system via os.path.exists() and open()",
  "flows": "file_path input -> os.path.exists() -> open() -> json.load()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, and no data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard inspection of function signatures using the inspect module and type hints. The file_to_json function reads a file specified by a path and parses its content as JSON, with proper exception handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data leakage, code injection, or hidden backdoors. Usage of os.path.exists() and open() are safe, and no user input is directly executed or sent over the network. The overall structure and operations are typical for utility functions and do not raise security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for inspecting functions and reading JSON files. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.",
