  "purpose": "Utility functions for inspecting function signatures and reading JSON files.",
  "sources": "File system access in 'file_to_json' to read files, inspect and get type hints from functions.",
  "sinks": "Reading files from the filesystem, JSON parsing which can process untrusted files.",
  "flows": "File existence check -> File opening -> JSON parsing; Function inspection flow involving parameter type extraction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. No obfuscated code or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static inspection of function signatures, extracting input and output types, particularly focusing on pydantic models. It reads files from the filesystem and parses them as JSON, with proper error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The file reading is limited to local files, and the JSON parsing uses standard libraries with error handling. Overall, the code appears to be utility functions with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides standard utility functions for introspection and file reading with proper error handling. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks present in this code fragment.",
