  "purpose": "Reads a specified file and returns its contents as an HTTP response object with optional headers and status code.",
  "sources": "File system access via os.path.exists, os.path.isfile, and open() for reading file data.",
  "sinks": "Creation of an httpx.Response object with file data as content, headers, and status code.",
  "flows": "File existence and type checks -> reading file data -> constructing httpx.Response with data and headers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation of file existence, type, and status code range. It reads the file in binary mode securely and constructs an HTTP response object with appropriate headers. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to good practices for serving static files. The potential security concern is serving untrusted files, but this is inherent to the utility's purpose and not a flaw in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for serving files as HTTP responses. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
