  "purpose": "Convert file data into an HTTP response object for serving files over HTTP",
  "sources": "Reads file data from the provided file_path, checks file existence and size, reads file content",
  "sinks": "Creates an httpx.Response object with the file data and headers",
  "flows": "Input file_path -> validate file -> read file content -> construct httpx.Response -> output response",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external network connections, no obfuscated code, no unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code performs file existence checks, size validation, and reads file data securely. It constructs an HTTP response object with the file data and customizable headers. No external network activity is performed, and no secrets or credentials are embedded. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious logic. It appears to be a straightforward utility for serving files as HTTP responses.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for serving files as HTTP responses. No malicious behavior or supply chain security risks are detected.",
