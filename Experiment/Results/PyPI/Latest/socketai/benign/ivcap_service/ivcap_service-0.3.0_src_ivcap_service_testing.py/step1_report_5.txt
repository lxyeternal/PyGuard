  "purpose": "Convert a file into an HTTP response object for serving file data with optional headers and status code.",
  "sources": "Reads file data from a specified file path using open() and os.path functions.",
  "sinks": "Creates an httpx.Response object with the file data and headers; outputs the response object.",
  "flows": "Reads file data from disk -> prepares headers -> constructs and returns httpx.Response object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. No external network connections or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file reading and response creation, with input validation for file existence, type, and status code. It safely reads file data into memory and constructs a response object with appropriate headers. No external data is transmitted, and no suspicious logic is present. The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security issues. It simply wraps file contents in an HTTP response.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and designed for serving file data over HTTP. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It is a standard utility function with proper validation and safe file handling.",
