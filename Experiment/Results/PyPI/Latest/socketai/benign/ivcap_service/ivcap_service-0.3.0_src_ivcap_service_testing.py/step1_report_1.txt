  "purpose": "Convert a file at a given path into an HTTP response object with optional headers and status code.",
  "sources": "The file_path parameter used to read data from a file; optional headers parameter for custom headers.",
  "sinks": "Creating an httpx.Response object that includes file data; potentially vulnerable if file contents are maliciously crafted, but generally safe in context.",
  "flows": "Input file path -> read file contents -> construct Response object with data and headers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code performs standard file reading and response creation.",
  "analysis": "The code validates the existence and type of the file, checks the status code range, combines default and user-supplied headers, and reads the file data into a response object. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or suspicious network activity. The use of open(), file reading, and response creation is straightforward. No obfuscation or malware signatures detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a safe utility to serve file contents as an HTTP response. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks in its implementation.",
