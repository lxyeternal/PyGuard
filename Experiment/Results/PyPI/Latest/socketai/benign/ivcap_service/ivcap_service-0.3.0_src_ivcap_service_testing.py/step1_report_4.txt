{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to read data from a specified file and return it as an HTTP response object using the httpx library, with customizable headers and status code.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from a file specified by 'file_path' using open() in binary mode.",
  "sinks": "The untrusted data read from the file is used as the content of an httpx.Response object, which could be transmitted over the network.",
  "flows": "File data is read from disk -> stored in 'file_data' -> used as content in httpx.Response object -> returned to caller.",
  "anomalies": "The code reads files directly specified by input; however, it does not validate or sanitize 'file_path' beyond existence and type checks. No evident malicious behavior, backdoors, or hidden functions are present. No code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file operations and constructs an HTTP response object without executing or evaluating untrusted code. It handles input validation for file existence, type, and status code ranges. The header merging uses a safe update method. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The usage of open() and httpx.Response appears straightforward and secure. No signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or sabotage are observed. The overall structure is clear and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code securely reads a file and constructs an HTTP response, with appropriate validation and error handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility function with no malicious intent.",
