{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and models for handling binary results, execution context, and errors in a system that likely executes or manages tools or scripts.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (io, typing, dataclasses, pydantic) and defines classes. No input reading or data input sources are explicitly present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows, such as network transmission, file writing, or command execution.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from sources to sinks; code primarily defines classes and data models.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard libraries and well-structured data classes without suspicious constructs or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code includes class definitions for handling binary data (`BinaryResult`, `IvcapResult`) and execution errors (`ExecutionError`). These are straightforward data containers using standard Python and pydantic for data validation. There are no input or output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of untrusted inputs within this snippet. The absence of network activity, system commands, or sensitive data handling suggests no malicious intent. The code appears to be part of a larger application focusing on data encapsulation and error reporting.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, non-malicious set of data models for managing results and errors in an execution environment. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. It is well-structured and uses safe coding practices.",
