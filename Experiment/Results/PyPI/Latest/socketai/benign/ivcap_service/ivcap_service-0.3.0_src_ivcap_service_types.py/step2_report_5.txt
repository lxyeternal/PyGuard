  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of data models and class definitions, with no external data handling, I/O, or dynamic code execution.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious patterns is identified.\n- The code relies on standard libraries and pydantic, which are common and safe.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or data flows from untrusted sources are present.\n- The purpose across reports is consistent: defining data structures for binary results and error reporting.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n\n1. **Malware Score (0):**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious intent or behavior. This is justified given the code's nature.\n\n2. **Obfuscated Score (0):**  \n   No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward.\n\n3. **Security Risk Score:**  \n   All reports assign a score of 0, which seems appropriate. The code is purely structural and does not perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Risk Score (0.0 - 0.5):**  \n   The reports assign a risk score of 0, which aligns with the absence of any security concerns. Since the code is only data models, this is reasonable.\n\n**Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable in their assessments.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all evaluations are cautious and justified.\n- The scores are appropriate given the code's content.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.\n- The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- I concur with the reports' assessments.\n- The overall scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- No further action required.\n\n**Summary of my own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the thorough analysis and the evidence provided.",
