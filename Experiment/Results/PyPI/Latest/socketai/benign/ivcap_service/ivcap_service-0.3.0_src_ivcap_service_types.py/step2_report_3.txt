  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\nAll five reports agree that the code is a set of data models and structures used for handling binary results and execution errors. They consistently state:\n\n- No external or untrusted data sources are read.\n- No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks.\n- No network, I/O, or dynamic code execution.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code is straightforward, using standard libraries and practices.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.\n\n**Confirmation of Issues in the Code:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions (`BinaryResult`, `IvcapResult`, `ExecutionError`) and imports.\n- No functions, methods, or executable logic that process external data.\n- No network or file I/O beyond data structure definitions.\n- No embedded malicious logic or obfuscation.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as safe and non-malicious.\n- No logical flaws or overgeneralizations are apparent.\n- The assessments appropriately consider the scope of the code (data models only).\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0, justified given the code's nature.\n\n**Risk and Malware Score Justification:**\n\n- Since the code is purely declarative data models with no executable or external interaction, a **risk score of 0** is appropriate.\n- The **malware score of 0** is justified because there's no malicious activity or behavior.\n- The **obfuscated score of 0** is correct, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about potential vulnerabilities, focusing only on observable code.\n- No discrepancies or unreasonable score adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Overall Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Overall Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Overall Security Risk Score:** **0**\n\nThe code is safe, standard, and free from malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. Based on the provided code and analysis, I concur with the assigned scores. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Keep all scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.  \n- No further action needed; the code is safe and well-understood.",
