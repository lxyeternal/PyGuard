{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and base classes for handling binary and error results in a tool execution context.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (io, typing, dataclasses) and pydantic for data validation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no data output or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to object instantiation and data validation within the class definitions; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The classes are straightforward data containers.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions and type annotations intended for serializing and managing tool execution results. No input handling, data processing, or external communication is implemented. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. Usage of pydantic for data validation does not introduce risk; it is standard practice. No anomalies or suspicious code structures are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a data schema and utility for handling binary content and errors. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious logic, and no security risks. It is safe to use.",
