{
  "purpose": "Define data structures and models for handling binary results and execution errors within a tool or system.",
  "sources": "The code reads constants, class definitions, and import statements; no external or untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; data structures are used internally for handling results and errors.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. The code appears to be straightforward data structure definitions with no embedded malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several classes, including dataclasses for BinaryResult and IvcapResult, as well as a Pydantic model for execution errors. There are no functions that process external inputs, no network operations, and no dynamic code execution. All classes are used for data encapsulation and serialization. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are apparent. The code is clean, well-structured, and contains only standard import and class definitions, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data models for handling binary results and errors, with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be safe and standard in purpose.",
