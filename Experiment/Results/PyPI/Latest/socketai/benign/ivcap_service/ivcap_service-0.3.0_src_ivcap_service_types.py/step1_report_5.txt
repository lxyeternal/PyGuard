{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and models for handling binary results, execution context, and errors within a tool or application.",
  "sources": "Imports external libraries (io, typing, dataclasses, pydantic), class definitions, and constant fields within classes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data leading to security issues; no I/O operations or network calls present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code primarily declares data models without dynamic data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed. Usage of type annotations and data classes appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for handling binary results and execution errors, using standard Python libraries and pydantic for data validation. There are no dynamic input/output operations, no network communication, and no code execution features that could be exploited. The data structures are straightforward, and no suspicious behaviors or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard and purely declarative, intended for defining data schemas and container classes. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
