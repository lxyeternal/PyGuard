{
  "purpose": "Define data structures and models for handling execution results and errors within a system, likely related to a tool or service.",
  "sources": "No external input sources detected; only class definitions and imports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to potential data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines data containers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; the code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for managing binary results, errors, and execution contexts. It imports standard libraries and pydantic for data validation. There are no functions or methods that process external input or handle untrusted data. The usage of io, typing, and dataclasses is conventional. The code does not include any obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior. All classes serve as data models with no executable logic or side effects. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, intended for data modeling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard, safe, and focused on defining data schemas.",
