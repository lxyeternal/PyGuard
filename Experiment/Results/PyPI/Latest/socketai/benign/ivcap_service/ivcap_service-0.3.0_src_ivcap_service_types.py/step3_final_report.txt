  "purpose": "Define data structures for handling binary results and execution errors in a safe, non-executable manner.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, input, or data reading; class definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; purely data container classes.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static data models only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data classes and models using standard libraries and pydantic, with no dynamic or external interactions. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute code. The structure is straightforward, and the code is clearly for data encapsulation. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's content and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard set of data models with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications or further actions are necessary.",
