  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely structural, defining data models for handling binary results and errors.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code uses standard libraries and practices, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, indicating no malicious behavior detected.\n- The security risk score is 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code matches the description—it's a set of data models with no processing logic, external interactions, or suspicious code.\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident. The code appears correct and well-structured.\n- **Scores:** The assigned scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- **Malware Justification:** Given the code's nature, a malware score higher than 0 is unjustified.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they explicitly state the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Are the scores reasonable?** Yes, the malware score of 0 is justified given the code content.\n- **Are the conclusions justified?** Yes, the conclusion that the code is safe and non-malicious is supported by the analysis.\n- **Any overlooked issues?** No. The code is straightforward data modeling code with no hidden malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is safe, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** The current scoring and assessment are correct. The code is benign and does not pose any security threat.",
