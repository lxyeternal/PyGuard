{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for defining, creating, and printing tool definitions based on Python functions, with integration of Pydantic models for schema generation and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (IVCAP_SERVICE_NAME, IVCAP_SERVICE_ID), function parameters, function docstrings, and Pydantic model schemas.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks include printing JSON output (print_tool_definition), returning schema JSON, and possibly using environment variables in insecure contexts.",
  "flows": "Input environment variables or function parameters flow into the creation of ToolDefinition objects; the function signatures and Pydantic schemas are processed to generate descriptive outputs; the outputs are printed or returned as JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code performs schema and signature generation for documentation purposes without evident malicious intent. The commented-out code is unrelated and non-executing. No obfuscated language features are used.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily generates documentation and schema representations for Python functions, leveraging Pydantic models and environment variables. No network access, data exfiltration, or harmful system modifications are evident. Environment variables are used for configuration but not in a manner that reveals secrets or credentials. The functions do not execute untrusted code or perform any operations that could harm the system. The overall structure indicates a standard utility for tool definition and documentation generation without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility for generating and printing tool definitions with schema information; it contains no suspicious or malicious behavior. The use of environment variables is standard for configuration. No malware or security risks are identified based on this code fragment.",
