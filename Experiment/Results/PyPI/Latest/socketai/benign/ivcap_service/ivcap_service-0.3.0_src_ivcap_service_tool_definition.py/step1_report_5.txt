{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for defining, generating, and printing tool definitions based on Python functions, particularly those using Pydantic models, for use in a schema-driven AI tool ecosystem.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('IVCAP_SERVICE_NAME', 'IVCAP_SERVICE_ID'), function inputs (including Pydantic models), function signatures, and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "Printing output of tool definitions (via print_tool_definition), JSON schema generation, and environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read for service names and IDs; create_tool_definition calls _get_input_type and _generate_function_description which process function annotations and schemas; create_tool_definition constructs ToolDefinition objects that include schema details; print_tool_definition outputs JSON schema.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code includes placeholder values like '#SERVICE_ID#' which could be substituted in deployment, but this alone is not malicious. There is no network activity, file writing, or data exfiltration observed. The functions mainly generate documentation and schema data. There are commented-out sections that are inactive. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily focused on generating schema definitions and descriptions for functions with Pydantic models. It reads environment variables for service identification and uses introspection to produce detailed function signatures and documentation. No network, file, or system modification operations are present. The only potentially concerning element is the placeholder '#SERVICE_ID#', which could be replaced at runtime, but this is a standard placeholder pattern. The overall logic appears benign, aimed at schema and documentation generation. No indicators of malicious intent or sabotage are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a schema/documentation utility for defining AI tool functions using Pydantic models. It does not contain any malicious behavior, network activity, or system manipulation. It appears safe and intended for legitimate schema generation and documentation purposes.",
