{
  "purpose": "Defines functions and classes to generate and print tool definitions with schema and metadata based on Python functions and Pydantic models, intended for use in a larger system that handles AI tools or services.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (IVCAP_SERVICE_NAME, IVCAP_SERVICE_ID), function arguments, and Pydantic model schemas; inspects function signatures and annotations.",
  "sinks": "None identified that would lead to data leakage or unsafe actions; no apparent data sinks for untrusted input or external effects.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and function inputs are used to generate schema and descriptions; no data flows directly to external systems or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; code is mainly schema generation and introspection with standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs introspection on functions and Pydantic models to generate schema documentation and tool definitions. It reads environment variables for service info, inspects function signatures and types, and constructs descriptive signatures and schemas. No external network or file system access is performed beyond environment variable reads and standard library use. The code does not include any data processing that could leak sensitive info, nor does it execute untrusted code dynamically. It is a typical schema/documentation generator with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. The absence of hidden behaviors, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms indicates low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving schema and documentation generation purposes for tools. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks based on analysis of its structure and content.",
