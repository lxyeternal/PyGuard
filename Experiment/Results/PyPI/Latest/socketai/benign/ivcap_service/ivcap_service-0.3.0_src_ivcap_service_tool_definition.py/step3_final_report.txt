{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for generating schema, documentation, and metadata for Python functions, especially those using Pydantic models, to facilitate tool definition and introspection.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., IVCAP_SERVICE_NAME, IVCAP_SERVICE_ID), function signatures, Pydantic model schemas, and function docstrings.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables and function annotations; generates JSON schemas and string representations; outputs JSON data; no external data sinks or malicious flows.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder string '#SERVICE_ID#' which could be replaced at runtime; however, this is a common pattern for configuration templates and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign utility for introspecting functions and Pydantic models to generate schemas and documentation. It relies on standard libraries and environment variables for configuration. No network activity, code injection, or data leakage is present. The placeholder '#SERVICE_ID#' is a typical template pattern, not a security concern. The code's structure is clear, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured utility for schema and documentation generation with no malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behavior. The existing scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
