  "purpose": "Library for building services for the IVCAP platform",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: __version__, getLogger, logging_init, start_batch_service, create_service_definition, create_tool_definition, print_tool_definition",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or output; the code primarily imports functions and variables",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow analysis as the code only contains import statements",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns; code consists of standard license comments, docstring, and import statements",
  "analysis": "The code includes licensing comments, a descriptive docstring, and imports several functions and variables from local modules. There is no executable code or data processing present, and no indications of malicious behavior. The imports are from internal modules, and no external data or untrusted inputs are processed. No signs of malware, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard library module setup for a larger application, with no malicious intent or security risks detected based solely on these import statements and comments.",
