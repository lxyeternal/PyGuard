  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initialization module for the IVCAP platform, importing various internal components and defining the package's version and services.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.version, .logger, .service, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks are present; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only imports internal modules without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script containing only import statements, licensing comments, and a module docstring. No executable logic, data handling, or network activity is present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning high confidence scores (1), with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the code's content. No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made, and the static analysis confirms the absence of malicious or risky patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no malicious intent or security issues. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, straightforward nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
