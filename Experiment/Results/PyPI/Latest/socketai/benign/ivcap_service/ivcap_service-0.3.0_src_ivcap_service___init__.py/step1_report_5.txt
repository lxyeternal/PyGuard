  "purpose": "Library for building services for the IVCAP platform, providing versioning, logging, and service management functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules within the package: .version, .logger, .service, .service_definition, .tool_definition",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data processing or external data handling evident in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified within this code fragment; it only contains import statements and docstring.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs detected; code appears to be standard package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package initialization script with import statements and licensing information. It imports modules related to versioning, logging, and service creation, which are standard for such libraries. There are no functions, data handling, or external interactions present. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code are detected. The code appears to be a standard, benign module setup with no security concerns evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a straightforward package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It only imports modules and contains licensing information, typical for open-source Python packages. No anomalies, malware indicators, or security threats are present.",
