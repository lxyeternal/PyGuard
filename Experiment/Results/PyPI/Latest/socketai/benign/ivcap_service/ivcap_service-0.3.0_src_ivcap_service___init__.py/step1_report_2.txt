  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.version, .logger, .service, .service_definition, .tool_definition)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication found",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; import statements are static and do not process data at runtime",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a descriptive comment. It imports functions and variables from local modules, which are typical in library packages. There is no evidence of data processing, user input handling, or external communications that could be malicious. The initial comments indicate copyright and licensing, standard for open-source projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign library initialization file with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
