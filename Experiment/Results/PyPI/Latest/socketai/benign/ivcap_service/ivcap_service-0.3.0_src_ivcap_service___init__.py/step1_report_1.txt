  "purpose": "Library for building services for the IVCAP platform",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .version, .logger, .service, .service_definition, .tool_definition",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Imports and function calls are mostly for initialization and configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources is visible",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; license and copyright statements are standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions and variables from local modules, likely part of a larger package. There are no user inputs, network operations, or execution of untrusted code. The license information and comments are standard and do not suggest malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be part of a standard package setup without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package initialization script for a Python library, with no signs of malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscation. It solely imports functions and variables needed for the library's operation.",
