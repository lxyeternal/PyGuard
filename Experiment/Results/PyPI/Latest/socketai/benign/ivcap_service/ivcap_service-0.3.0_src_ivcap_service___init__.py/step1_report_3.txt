  "purpose": "A library for building services for the IVCAP platform",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.version, .logger, .service, .service_definition, .tool_definition)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; primarily module imports and function definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns; straightforward import statements and documentation",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and descriptive comments. It does not process data, handle inputs, or execute any logic that could lead to security issues. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The imports are from local modules, and there are no network operations, eval calls, or data leaks. The license comment and version info are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign library module with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as an import hub for other components related to the IVCAP platform.",
