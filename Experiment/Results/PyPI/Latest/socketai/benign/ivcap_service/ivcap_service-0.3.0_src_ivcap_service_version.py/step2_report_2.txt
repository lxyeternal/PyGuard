  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code initializes `__version__` with `'???'`.\n- It attempts to import `version` from `importlib_metadata` (for Python > 3.8+).\n- If import fails, it tries to use `pkg_resources.get_distribution`.\n- If both fail, `__version__` remains `'???'`.\n- The function `get_version()` returns `__version__`.\n- No external input, no data processing, no network activity.\n- The code is standard for Python package version retrieval.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Correctly states the code retrieves the version of `'ivcap_service'`.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Accurate.\n- Anomalies: Notes `'???'` as a placeholder, which is common.\n- Analysis: Appropriately describes the fallback mechanisms and standard practices.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior, standard code.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate, reasonable, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Correct.\n- Anomalies: No anomalies, standard methods.\n- Analysis: Correctly identifies the purpose and the fallback approach.\n- Conclusion: Safe, typical implementation.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same purpose.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Correct.\n- Anomalies: Notes `'???'` as a placeholder, possibly incomplete but not malicious.\n- Analysis: Same as above, standard methods.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent; placeholder suggests incomplete code but not harmful.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Correct.\n- Anomalies: `'???'` placeholder, but no malicious activity.\n- Analysis: Correctly notes the placeholder and the standard approach.\n- Conclusion: No signs of malicious activity; placeholder is benign.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (very low, possibly due to placeholder)\n\n**Assessment:** Valid, reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Correct.\n- Anomalies: Placeholder `'???'` again, but no malicious activity.\n- Analysis: Correctly describes the process.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent; placeholder is benign.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard version retrieval snippet.\n- The placeholder `'???'` is consistent across reports and is a common practice for uninitialized or default values, not malicious.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The fallback mechanisms are standard and safe.\n- The scores for malware (0) are appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The malware scores should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- The obfuscated scores should stay at 0.\n- The risk scores are appropriate; minor placeholder usage doesn't constitute a security risk.\n- The confidence levels are justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to placeholder, but negligible)\n- **Confidence:** High (around 0.9-1)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, safe version retrieval snippet with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The placeholder `'???'` does not indicate malicious intent but perhaps incomplete code. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.",
