  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code's behavior, and assess the scoring.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Purpose: Retrieve and return the version of the 'ivcap_service' package.\n- Method: Use `importlib_metadata` (for Python > 3.8+) or fallback to `pkg_resources`.\n- Initial value of `__version__` is `'???'`, a placeholder.\n- No external inputs, no untrusted data processing, no network activity.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Observations:\n\n- **Functionality**: The code performs a standard package version retrieval, with fallback mechanisms. The placeholder `'???'` indicates incomplete or default code, not malicious intent.\n- **Behavior**: No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Potential concern**: The placeholder `'???'` could be viewed as a sign of incomplete code, but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Summary**: Accurate; describes standard behavior, no anomalies.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0 — correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - Security risk: 0 — correct.\n  - Confidence: 0.9 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion**: Fully aligned with the code's behavior. No issues.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Summary**: Correct; standard version retrieval, no anomalies.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0 — correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - Security risk: 0 — correct.\n  - Confidence: 1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion**: Accurate.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Summary**: Correct; standard approach, placeholder `'???'` noted.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0 — correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - Security risk: 0 — acceptable, though the placeholder might be slightly noteworthy.\n  - Confidence: 0.9 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion**: Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Summary**: Correct; straightforward, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0 — correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - Security risk: 0.1 — perhaps slightly high given no actual risk, but acceptable considering the placeholder.\n  - Confidence: 0.9 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion**: Valid.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Summary**: Correct; standard, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0 — correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - Security risk: 0.1 — acceptable.\n  - Confidence: 1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion**: Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score**: All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk score**: Slightly above 0 (0.1) in some reports due to the placeholder `'???'`, which could be considered incomplete or placeholder code, but not malicious.\n\n**However**, given the code's simplicity and the absence of any malicious or suspicious behavior, I would **adjust the overall risk score** to **0.0** for clarity and to reflect the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score**: **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score**: **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score**: **0** — no security risks; placeholder `'???'` is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard package version retrieval snippet with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The placeholder `'???'` does not indicate malicious intent but suggests incomplete implementation. All reports correctly assess the code as safe.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nSet **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **risk = 0**.",
