{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'ivcap_service' package using different import methods based on Python version and availability.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata through importlib_metadata or pkg_resources, and the __version__ variable is set based on these attempts.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external system effects are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves attempting to get the package version via importlib_metadata or pkg_resources, then returning __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard package metadata retrieval methods without obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to determine the version of a package named 'ivcap_service' by first trying to use importlib_metadata (recommended for Python >= 3.8). If that fails, it falls back to pkg_resources from setuptools. The exception handling is broad but standard for such metadata access. No malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The logic is straightforward and adheres to common practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for obtaining package version information. It does not contain malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and typical for Python package version retrieval.",
