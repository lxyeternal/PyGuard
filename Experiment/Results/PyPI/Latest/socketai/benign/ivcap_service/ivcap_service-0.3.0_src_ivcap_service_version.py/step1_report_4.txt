  "purpose": "Retrieve and return the version number of the 'ivcap_service' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version using importlib_metadata or pkg_resources based on the package name 'ivcap_service'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external input or produce output based on untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code sources version information from package metadata and provides it via get_version(). No external data flows to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The version variable is set to '???' initially, which is unusual but not malicious; it suggests an uninitialized or placeholder value. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to determine the version of a specific package using standard Python libraries. It first tries importlib_metadata (Python > 3.8+), falling back to pkg_resources if necessary. The initial version is a placeholder ('???'), which may indicate incomplete code or a default value. The functions and imports used are standard for package version retrieval and do not perform any suspicious operations. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version retrieval utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The placeholder version may suggest incomplete implementation but poses no security threat.",
