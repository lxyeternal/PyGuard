  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the 'ivcap_service' package using different methods depending on the Python environment.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'importlib_metadata' and 'pkg_resources', and the attribute '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "Return statement in 'get_version' function.",
  "flows": "Import metadata from package distribution sources to assign to '__version__', then return '__version__' in 'get_version'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The version attribute is set with placeholders ('???'), indicating potential incomplete or placeholder code, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to obtain the version of a package named 'ivcap_service' via two common methods compatible with various Python environments. The first uses 'importlib_metadata' for Python > 3.8+, and the second falls back to 'pkg_resources' if the first is unavailable. No external data input, user input, or network activity is involved. The placeholder '__version__' set to '???' suggests incomplete or placeholder code but does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard way of fetching package version information, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of placeholders indicates incomplete implementation, not malicious intent.",
