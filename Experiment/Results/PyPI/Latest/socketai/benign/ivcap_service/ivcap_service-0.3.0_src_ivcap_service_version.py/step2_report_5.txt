  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code performs standard version retrieval with fallback mechanisms.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None. The placeholder `'???'` is typical for uninitialized version info.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0. These seem appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Justification for scores:** No malicious activity or obfuscation; the code is straightforward.\n- **Potential concerns:** The placeholder `'???'` could suggest incomplete code, but it's not malicious.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to Report 1, standard practice.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0. Appropriate.\n- **Notes:** The code is clear, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is standard, with the same placeholder `'???'`.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0. Appropriate.\n- **Notes:** Placeholder suggests incomplete code, not malicious.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The only minor concern is the placeholder `'???'`, but this is not malicious.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0. The slight securityRisk score is perhaps due to the placeholder, but it's minimal.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; the placeholder is benign. The securityRisk score could be slightly increased if considering incomplete code, but overall, it's low.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Standard version retrieval.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0. Appropriate.\n- **Notes:** The placeholder `'???'` is again the only oddity, but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the placeholder `'???'`, which might indicate incomplete code, a slightly elevated securityRisk score (around 0.1) is reasonable, but not higher, as there's no active vulnerability or malicious activity.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 for each, due to the placeholder `'???'` which might indicate incomplete implementation but no security threat.\n\n**Final note:** The code is standard, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The placeholder `'???'` is common in template or incomplete code but doesn't pose a security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n- The overall security risk is minimal; the code is benign.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe, and the reports are justified.",
