{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the 'ivcap_service' package using different methods depending on the Python environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from package metadata using 'importlib_metadata' or 'pkg_resources'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves attempting to import version information from package metadata and assigning it to __version__, then returning it via get_version().",
  "anomalies": "The __version__ is set to '???' initially, which is unusual but not malicious. The code gracefully handles import errors without exposing sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to determine the package version. It first tries to use 'importlib_metadata' for Python > 3.8+, falling back to 'pkg_resources' if needed. The initial placeholder '???' is replaced if successful. No user input, network activity, or external data manipulation occurs. There are no suspicious patterns or behaviors; the exception handling is standard for package version retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version retrieval snippet with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply accesses package metadata safely and appropriately. No malware or obfuscation is present.",
