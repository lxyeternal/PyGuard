  "purpose": "Retrieve and return the version of the 'ivcap_service' package, using importlib_metadata or pkg_resources as fallback.",
  "sources": "Import statements for importlib_metadata or pkg_resources, assignment to __version__, and the placeholder '???'.",
  "sinks": "The function get_version() returns __version__, no untrusted data or external inputs involved.",
  "flows": "Initialization of __version__ -> attempt import -> fallback to pkg_resources -> return __version__ via get_version().",
  "anomalies": "The placeholder string '???' assigned to __version__, indicating incomplete or default code, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package version retrieval with fallback mechanisms. The placeholder '???' is a common placeholder for uninitialized or incomplete code, not malicious. No external inputs, network activity, or suspicious logic are present. The fallback methods are standard practice. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected. The minor placeholder does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for retrieving package version info. The placeholder '???' is benign and indicates incomplete code, not malicious intent. All signals point to a safe, straightforward snippet with no security concerns.",
