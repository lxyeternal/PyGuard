{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to determine and return the version number of the 'ivcap_service' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads package version information from package management tools such as importlib_metadata or pkg_resources.",
  "sinks": "The version information is returned via the get_version() function; no untrusted input or sensitive data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves version data from package metadata sources and provides it through the get_version() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard package version retrieval with fallback mechanisms. The '__version__' variable is initialized with a placeholder ('???'), which is a common placeholder rather than a malicious indicator.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to obtain the version of 'ivcap_service' using modern importlib_metadata (for Python > 3.8+) and falls back to pkg_resources if the import fails. The '__version__' variable is initially set to '???' as a placeholder. No external inputs are processed, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The version retrieval logic is standard for Python packages, with exception handling to manage missing dependencies or errors. The get_version() function simply returns the stored version string.\n\nOverall, the code is straightforward, non-malicious, and appears to serve a legitimate purpose of providing version information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical version retrieval snippet for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It employs standard practices with fallback mechanisms and contains no suspicious or harmful actions.",
