  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code attempts to retrieve the version of the package 'ivcap_service' using `importlib_metadata` (for Python > 3.8+) or `pkg_resources` as fallback.\n- The variable `__version__` is initialized to `'???'` (a placeholder).\n- The function `get_version()` returns `__version__`.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or untrusted data processing occurs.\n- The code is straightforward and employs standard practices for package version retrieval.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes `'???'` as a placeholder, which is common.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is standard, non-malicious, with fallback mechanisms.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; placeholder `'???'` noted.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; standard approach, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholder `'???'` noted as incomplete, not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; standard method, placeholder indicates incomplete code but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholder `'???'` is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; straightforward, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1 (slightly elevated), Confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The slight increase in security risk is acceptable given the placeholder, but it's not indicative of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholder `'???'` noted, but no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; standard approach, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Final Judgment:\n\n- **Code Behavior & Anomalies:** The only notable \"anomaly\" is the placeholder `'???'` assigned to `__version__`. This is common in template or incomplete code, not malicious.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware or obfuscation.\n- **Security Risks:** The code is safe; the minor placeholder does not pose a security threat.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports correctly assign malware=0, with minor variations in security risk (0.1), which is acceptable given the placeholder.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to placeholder; not a security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard version retrieval snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The placeholder `'???'` suggests incomplete code or a template, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:** The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable. I would maintain `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, and `securityRisk=0.1`. The slight elevation in security risk reflects the placeholder but does not indicate a real vulnerability.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code is safe, standard, and not malicious.",
