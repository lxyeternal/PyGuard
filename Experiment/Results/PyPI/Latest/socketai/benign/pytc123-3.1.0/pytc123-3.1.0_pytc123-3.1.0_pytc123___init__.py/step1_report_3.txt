  "purpose": "Fetches IP information from ipinfo.io and saves it to a file in the root directory.",
  "sources": "requests.get('http://ipinfo.io') - network request to external server",
  "sinks": "open('/root/ttt.txt', 'w') - writes data to a file in root directory",
  "flows": "requests.get() -> r.text -> open() -> f.write(r.text) - data fetched from network and written to file",
  "anomalies": "Writes data directly to a file in /root directory, which may require root privileges; no explicit hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a network request to an external service ipinfo.io, retrieves the response text, and writes it directly to a file in /root/ttt.txt. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful payloads. The use of /root directory suggests it needs elevated privileges, but this is not inherently malicious. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code's purpose appears to be benign data retrieval and storage.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a simple external IP information fetch and saves it locally, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. However, writing directly to /root/ directory may require root privileges and could be a concern in restricted environments, but not malicious per se.",
