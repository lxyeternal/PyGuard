  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file via open() function.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processed or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' from source to long_description parameter.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without exception handling; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script defining package metadata, with a single dynamic operation reading a local README file. No untrusted data, network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The use of open() without error handling is common but could cause runtime errors if the file is missing; however, this does not imply malicious intent. All dependency lists are empty, indicating no external code execution during setup. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, standard, and free of malicious or security risks. The only minor concern is the lack of exception handling for file reading, which does not impact security. The provided reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, with high confidence.",
