  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration script for packaging a Python project named 'pytc123'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data or user input; no network or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'open' to read 'README.md' without error handling; dependency list is empty with a comment, which is normal.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, author info, and description. The only notable operation is reading a local 'README.md' file for the long description, which is a common practice. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or suspicious code patterns are present. There are no obfuscated parts or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be legitimate and follows typical packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
