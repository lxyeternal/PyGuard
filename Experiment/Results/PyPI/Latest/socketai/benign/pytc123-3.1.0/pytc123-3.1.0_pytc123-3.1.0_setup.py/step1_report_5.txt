  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project named 'pytc123'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no execution of untrusted data or commands.",
  "flows": "Reading the README.md content during setup, but this is a safe, standard operation.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses 'open' to read 'README.md' without any validation, but this is typical for setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior apparent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' to configure package metadata. It specifies package name, version, author info, dependencies (empty here), description, and URL. It reads 'README.md' for long description. No suspicious or malicious behavior, code injection, or malicious data flows are evident. The code appears to be a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no external data sources or sinks that could lead to security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
