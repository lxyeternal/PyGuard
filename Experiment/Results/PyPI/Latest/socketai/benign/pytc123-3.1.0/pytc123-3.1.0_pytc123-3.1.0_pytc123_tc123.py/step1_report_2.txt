  "purpose": "The code defines two simple functions that print formatted messages involving a provided word.",
  "sources": "The functions take input via the 'word' parameter, which is supplied at function call time.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' statements output data to the console, which could be viewed as a sink if the data is sensitive or untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input from the 'word' parameter flows into the print statement, but there are no further sinks or data transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The print statements are straightforward and static. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The functions are simple print wrappers that format and output strings with the provided input. There are no indications of data exfiltration, malicious commands, or hidden behaviors. The code does not perform any network operations, file access, or execute dynamic code. Overall, the code appears benign, serving a basic display purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is harmless, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely prints messages containing the provided input, with no malicious or suspicious behavior observed.",
