{
  "purpose": "The code defines two functions that print formatted messages incorporating a string parameter, with no external data or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'word' in each function; static string literals within print statements.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting formatted strings; no untrusted data flow leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input 'word' flows directly into print statements without modification; no external data or network activity involved.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of the string 'hijacked' in a print message could be suspicious out of context, but here it is a benign static string.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple functions that output formatted messages with user input. No external data sources, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The message '123 hijacked' may seem suspicious but is just a string literal. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there is no malicious intent. The security risk score is minimal (0 or 0.1), justified by the benign static message. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code and absence of suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate, and there is no evidence of security risks. The presence of the word 'hijacked' in a static string does not indicate malicious activity.",
