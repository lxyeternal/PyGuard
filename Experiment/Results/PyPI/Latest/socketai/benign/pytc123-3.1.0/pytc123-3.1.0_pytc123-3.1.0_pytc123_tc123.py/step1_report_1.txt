{
  "purpose": "The code defines two functions that print messages including a provided word, seemingly for demonstration or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data is taken via function parameters 'word' in print123 and print888.",
  "sinks": "The functions print formatted strings to standard output, which is a benign sink in this context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function input 'word' to the print statements without additional processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious payloads are present. The message '123 hijacked' could be suspicious in a different context, but here it appears to be a benign string.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple functions that output formatted strings including user-provided input. There are no external data reads, no network activity, no malicious code, and no suspicious behavior. The message content might raise some curiosity, but as written, it does not constitute malicious activity. The functions are straightforward and lack any obfuscated or complex behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, performing simple logging or messaging without any malicious intent or security risks.",
