  "purpose": "The code defines two functions intended to print messages incorporating a provided word.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'word' for both functions, received from external callers.",
  "sinks": "The print statements that output formatted strings containing the input 'word'.",
  "flows": "Input 'word' flows into the print statements where it is formatted into output messages.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The messages appear benign and are purely for display purposes. No data exfiltration, network activity, or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple functions that print formatted strings with a provided argument. There are no external data sources other than function arguments. No use of environment variables, no network calls, no file operations, and no dynamic code execution. The functions do not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears benign. It simply outputs messages with the input string. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
