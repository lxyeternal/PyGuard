  "purpose": "The code defines two functions that print messages including a provided word with specific identifiers.",
  "sources": "The functions take 'word' as input, which is used in print statements.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' statements output data to standard output; no untrusted data is sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input 'word' flows into the print statements but does not lead to further processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The function names and print messages are benign and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two simple functions that output formatted strings including user-supplied input. There are no indications of malicious behavior, external data transmission, or suspicious activities. The functions are straightforward and do not involve complex or obfuscated logic. No anomalies such as hidden code, backdoors, or malicious side effects are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing simple print operations with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
