  "purpose": "Define functions to obtain configuration and data file paths relative to user home directory and script directory.",
  "sources": "os.path.expanduser(\"~\"), os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))",
  "sinks": "None; the functions only generate file paths and do not handle untrusted data",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from external sources to critical sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is straightforward and only constructs file paths.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions that return paths for configuration and data files based on user home directory and script location. It uses standard os.path functions with no input validation or external data handling. There are no hardcoded secrets, no network operations, and no code obfuscation or malicious constructs. The copyright line appears reversed but is likely a placeholder or stylistic choice, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to generate file paths for configuration and data storage. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or security issues.",
