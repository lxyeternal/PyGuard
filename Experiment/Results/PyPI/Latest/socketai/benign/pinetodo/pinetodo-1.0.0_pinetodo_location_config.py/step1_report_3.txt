  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve configuration and data file paths in the user's home directory and current script directory.",
  "sources": "os.path.expanduser(\"~\"), os.path.join(), os.path.abspath(__file__), os.path.dirname()",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is being sent or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Input sources are the home directory and script directory; paths are constructed locally without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions to generate file paths based on the user's home directory and the current script's directory. It uses standard os.path functions without any external data inputs, network operations, or sensitive data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The copyright statement is unusual but not harmful.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be straightforward, utility functions for file path management with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving simple utility functions for path retrieval without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
