  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve configuration and data file paths within the user's home directory and the current script's directory.",
  "sources": "os.path.expanduser(\"~\"), os.path.join(), os.path.abspath(__file__), os.path.dirname()",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; functions return file paths without accessing or writing data.",
  "flows": "The functions generate file paths based on user home directory and script location; no untrusted data input or output flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. The code simply constructs file paths with standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: one retrieves a config file path in the user's home directory, the other retrieves a data directory path relative to the script's location. Both functions use standard, safe os.path functions. No user input, environment variables (beyond expanding home directory), or external data sources are accessed at runtime. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or secret harvesting.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for locating configuration and data files. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
