  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve configuration and data file paths based on user home directory and current script location.",
  "sources": "os.path.expanduser(\"~\"), os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes data; only constructs file paths.",
  "flows": "Input from environment (home directory) flows into file path construction; no untrusted input processing beyond path concatenation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The copyright year is in the future but does not impact security.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os' and defines two functions: 'get_config_path' constructs a path to a config file in the user's home directory, and 'get_data_path' constructs a data directory path relative to the script's location. Both functions only generate file paths without reading, writing, or executing data. No external input is processed in a malicious manner. There are no signs of obfuscated code, data leaks, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, safe, and does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks. It simply provides path locations for configuration and data files based on system information.",
