{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to retrieve file paths for configuration and data storage, likely for a local application.",
  "sources": "os.path.expanduser('~') for the home directory, and __file__ for current script location.",
  "sinks": "File path constructions are used for reading/writing config and data files; no direct data leakage or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Home directory path from expanduser() flows into config file path; script directory from __file__ flows into data path.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year '2025' is in the future; no other anomalies or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply constructs file paths based on the user's home directory and the script's location. It uses standard os functions with no input validation, external communication, or execution of untrusted data. There are no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no malicious activities identified. The functions appear safe and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving to determine configuration and data storage paths. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
