  "purpose": "Constructs file paths for configuration and data storage based on system environment.",
  "sources": "os.path.expanduser(\"~\"), os.path.abspath(__file__), os.path.dirname(), os.path.join()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted",
  "flows": "Environment variables and script location data flow into path construction functions",
  "anomalies": "Unusual future copyright year (2025), but not security relevant",
  "analysis": "The code defines two straightforward functions for path management using standard os.path functions. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security flaws are present. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is stylistic. The code's simplicity and use of standard libraries confirm its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for path retrieval with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
