  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code only constructs file paths based on system information.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is identified.\n- The functions are simple, safe, and use standard library functions.\n- No external input is processed beyond environment variables, and no data is read, written, or transmitted.\n- The copyright year in the code is in the future (2025), but this is stylistic and not security-relevant.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malware, malicious behavior, or security flaws.\n- The functions are benign utility functions for path retrieval.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The only minor point is the copyright year being in the future (2025). While unusual, it does not impact security.\n- No other logical or security flaws are present.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- No issues justify a score higher than 0.5, as there is no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- The only questionable element is the future copyright year, but this is stylistic, not security-related.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted here.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- The code is entirely benign.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a simple, safe utility with no security concerns.",
