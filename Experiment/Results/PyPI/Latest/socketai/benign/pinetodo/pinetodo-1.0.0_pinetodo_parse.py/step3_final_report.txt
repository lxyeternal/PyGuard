  "purpose": "CLI argument parser for a task management application, handling commands like add, delete, list, edit, and import/export tasks.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments parsed via argparse, including user inputs for task IDs, titles, statuses, and import paths or URLs.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external operations; normalization of task IDs by prefixing '#' without validation.",
  "flows": "User inputs flow from command-line arguments to internal preprocessing (adding '#' prefix), but no further data processing or external communication is shown.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; the only notable aspect is the future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI argument parser with no code execution, network activity, or data leaks. The normalization of task IDs is benign but lacks validation, which could cause downstream issues if not handled properly elsewhere. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The import options accept paths or URLs, but no actual file or network operations are performed within this snippet. The license comments are standard, with an unusual future year but no malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and free of security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard CLI parser for task management with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities. The minor concern about unvalidated input normalization is not malicious but should be handled carefully in downstream processing. The import feature's potential risks depend on external code, not shown here. Overall, the code is low risk and trustworthy.",
