  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard CLI for task management; inputs are command-line args.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct execution or network activity; inputs are processed and normalized.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no obfuscated code, and the future date in the copyright.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward argument parsing with no malicious behavior. The import feature's security implications depend on downstream code, which isn't shown. The risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable given the potential for untrusted data handling elsewhere, but within this snippet, no direct risks are present.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both zero, consistent with the code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on input normalization and no network or code execution.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 seems appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Zero.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on input normalization without validation.\n- **Potential concern:** Lack of validation could lead to downstream issues but not malicious activity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 is reasonable.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Zero.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to previous reports; no suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 appropriate.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Zero.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Summarizes the code as a standard CLI parser with no malicious elements.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0–0.1 is justified.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Zero.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None. The code is a typical argument parser for a task management CLI.\n- **Potential security issues:** The only minor concern is the import functionality that accepts URLs or file paths, which could be exploited if the downstream code executes or processes untrusted data insecurely. However, within this snippet, no such processing occurs.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Malware:** None detected.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to the import feature that could be misused if not handled securely downstream.\n\n**Note:** The code appears safe and standard for CLI argument parsing. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are evident in this snippet.",
