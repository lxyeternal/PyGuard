  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard CLI parser for task management with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities. The minor concern about unvalidated input normalization is not malicious but should be handled carefully in downstream processing. The import feature's potential risks depend on external code, not shown here. Overall, the code is low risk and trustworthy."
