  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project.\n- It reads a local README.md file with specified encoding, defines package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and URLs.\n- No dynamic code execution, network operations, or untrusted data handling are present.\n- All dependencies are standard, benign packages.\n- The `main` function is referenced in the entry point, but its implementation is outside this script, which is typical.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and findings:\n\n**Presence of issues in code:**\n- The code matches the description; no issues are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n- The setup process is straightforward and standard.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- None identified.\n- The code appears correct and follows best practices.\n\n**Scores assigned in reports:**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `confidence: 1`.\n- These are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- No report assigns a risk higher than 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- The code does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data.\n\n**Malware score considerations:**\n- All reports correctly assign `malware: 0`.\n- No malicious activity is evident.\n\n**Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All reports are cautious and do not assume malicious intent where none exists.\n- They correctly identify the code as standard setup script.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- All scores are consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Given the analysis, I agree with the provided scores: **malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a legitimate, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n**Malware score: 0**  \n**Obfuscated score: 0**  \n**Risk score: 0**",
