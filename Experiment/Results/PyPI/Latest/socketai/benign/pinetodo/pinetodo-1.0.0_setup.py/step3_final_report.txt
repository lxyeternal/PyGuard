  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'pinetodo' project, defining metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; defines package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward setup script with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' configuration using setuptools. It reads a local README file, sets package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry points. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. Dependencies are common packages ('json5', 'requests', 'rich'). The 'main' function is referenced but implemented outside this script, which is standard. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are detected. The code is clear, static, and follows best practices for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup configuration with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe and legitimate setup process.",
