{
  "purpose": "A simple entry point script that imports a command handler and executes it.",
  "sources": "Reading the module 'router' via relative import; reading sys and os modules; reading environment via os.path and __file__",
  "sinks": "Calling handle_command() function; potential data flow depending on handle_command implementation",
  "flows": "Code execution flows from main() to handle_command(), which may process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "Unusual comment with a future copyright year '2025'; no apparent hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; standard import and execution pattern",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function handle_command from a local module, adds the current directory to sys.path, and executes handle_command() in main(). The only external interaction is the invocation of handle_command(). There are no hardcoded credentials, environment variable usage, or network calls visible. The code structure appears straightforward and typical for an entry point script. Without the implementation of handle_command(), the actual malicious potential cannot be fully assessed, but there are no suspicious patterns in this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard launcher for a command handling module. There is no direct evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data flow in this code segment. The only concern is the future copyright date, which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.",
