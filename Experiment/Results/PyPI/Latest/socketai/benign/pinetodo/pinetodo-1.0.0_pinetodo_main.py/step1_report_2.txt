  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize and execute a command handler, likely part of a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via os.path and sys.path; importing handle_command from a local module.",
  "sinks": "Calling handle_command(), which could process untrusted input depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "The main flow is from the script execution to handle_command() invocation.",
  "anomalies": "The code modifies sys.path at runtime by inserting the current directory, which could be used to execute malicious modules if an attacker controls the filesystem. The copyright year is set to 2025, which is in the future, but this is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a function handle_command from a relative module, modifies sys.path to include the current directory, and calls handle_command() if run as main. The sys.path modification can influence module resolution, potentially leading to execution of malicious or unintended code if an attacker places a malicious module with the same name in the directory. The handle_command() function is external and unknown, so its behavior is a potential source of risk. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures are present. The overall design is simple, but the sys.path manipulation warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is minimal and primarily sets up a command handling routine with a potentially risky sys.path modification. Without further context or knowledge of handle_command(), there is a moderate risk due to sys.path alteration, which could be exploited to execute malicious modules. No overt malicious behavior or malware signatures are evident from this code fragment alone.",
