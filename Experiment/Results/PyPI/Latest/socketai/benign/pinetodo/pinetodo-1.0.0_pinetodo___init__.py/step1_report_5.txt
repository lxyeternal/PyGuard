{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility script for processing data, potentially for a larger application.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, user input via function parameters, and possibly from external files or network calls if present.",
  "sinks": "Data might be written to files, printed to console, sent over network connections, or stored in databases depending on the functions used.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or user input through processing functions, potentially reaching output or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual dynamic code execution detected. However, if there are external file or network operations, these need closer review.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for malicious constructs, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. It mostly contains standard data handling routines. Without suspicious network calls, hidden code, or hardcoded secrets, it does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior. The structure and variable usage are straightforward, with no obfuscation or obfuscated imports. The code's purpose seems benign, involving data processing or transformation. No anomalies like hidden or malicious code segments were identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The code appears to be a standard utility with no suspicious behavior detected. The overall security risk is low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
