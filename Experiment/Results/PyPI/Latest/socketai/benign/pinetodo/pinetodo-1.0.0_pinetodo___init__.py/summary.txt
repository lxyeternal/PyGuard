  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The reports are generally consistent and cautious. The only notable point is the dynamic code execution in report 4, which warrants a risk score of around 0.2–0.3. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. Final assessment: no confirmed malicious activity; scores reflect a low to moderate risk environment primarily due to dynamic execution features."
