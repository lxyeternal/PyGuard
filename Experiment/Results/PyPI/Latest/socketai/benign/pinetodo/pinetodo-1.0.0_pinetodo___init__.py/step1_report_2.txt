  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or functionality related to a Python package, but the specific purpose cannot be determined due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, imported modules, possibly reads user input or external data via network calls or file operations (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to files, sends data over network connections, executes system commands, or manipulates sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Data flow from input sources (environment variables, user input, external data) to processing functions, and then to output sinks such as network or file system.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code lacks comments or documentation that might clarify intent.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly; however, without specific code content provided, a detailed analysis cannot be completed. No suspicious imports, functions, or behaviors are apparent. To confirm security concerns, the actual code content is necessary.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of visible malicious patterns or anomalies, the code does not show signs of malicious behavior or security risks. However, due to lack of actual code content, this conclusion has low confidence.",
