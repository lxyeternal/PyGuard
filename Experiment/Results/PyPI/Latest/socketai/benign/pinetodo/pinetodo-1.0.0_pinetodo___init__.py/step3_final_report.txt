  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security reports of an open source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, ensuring scores are consistent with findings.",
  "sources": "No actual code provided; analysis based on report descriptions and code features discussed.",
  "sinks": "Potential dynamic execution points (eval/exec), network/file operations, environment variables, which could lead to data leaks or malicious exploitation if untrusted data is processed.",
  "flows": "Dynamic code execution (eval/exec) as source, with potential sinks being system commands, network connections, or environment variables; however, no confirmed malicious data flow is observed.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec without validation, which could be exploited; lack of code makes definitive analysis difficult, but the mention of dynamic execution is noteworthy.",
  "analysis": "All reports without code appropriately assign low or zero scores for malware and obfuscation, reflecting no evidence of malicious activity. Report 4 discusses dynamic code execution, which introduces moderate risk (0.3) but no confirmed malicious behavior, so malware score remains at 0. The risk score in report 4 could be slightly increased to 0.2 for consistency, but 0.3 remains acceptable. Confidence levels align with the amount of information; higher where code features are discussed. Overall, scores are consistent with the descriptions; no major adjustments needed.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are generally consistent and cautious. The only notable point is the dynamic code execution in report 4, which warrants a risk score of around 0.2–0.3. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. Final assessment: no confirmed malicious activity; scores reflect a low to moderate risk environment primarily due to dynamic execution features.",
