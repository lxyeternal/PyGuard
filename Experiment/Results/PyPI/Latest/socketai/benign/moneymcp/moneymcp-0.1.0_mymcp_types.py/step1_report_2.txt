  "purpose": "Define string literal types for search categories, top financial data types, and sectors.",
  "sources": "No external data input or reading sources; the code only declares type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; purely type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of static type alias definitions using Literal; no anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several Literal type aliases for categorizing search types, top financial data, and sectors. There are no data inputs, external calls, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be straightforward type annotations for use with static type checkers. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present, and the code does not interact with any system resources or perform any logic beyond type declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely defining type aliases for data categorization with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe and intended for static type checking purposes only.",
