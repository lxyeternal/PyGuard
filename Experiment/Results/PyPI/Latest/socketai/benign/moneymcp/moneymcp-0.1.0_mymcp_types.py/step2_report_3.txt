  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is solely defining type aliases using `Literal`. There are no functions, data processing, input/output, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors is present.\n   - The code's purpose appears to be static type checking, which is benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is straightforward, static, and safe.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n   - The reasoning that the code is benign and only used for static type annotations is sound.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The `risk` scores are all 0.0, which is reasonable because the code doesn't perform any operations that could introduce security risks.\n   - Since the code is purely declarative, higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid assuming any vulnerabilities beyond what is evident.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious intent are made, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency and Final Assessment:**\n   - The overall assessment is consistent across all reports.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and benign nature, I agree with the current scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk, as the code is purely static type definitions.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, and the current scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign set of type alias definitions using Python's `Literal`. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores reflect the absence of malicious or risky behavior. I concur with the existing assessments.",
