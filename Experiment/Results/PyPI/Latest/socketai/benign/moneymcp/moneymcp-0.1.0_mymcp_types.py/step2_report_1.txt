  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code solely consists of defining type aliases using `Literal` from Python's `typing` module.\n   - These type aliases categorize search types, top categories, and sectors.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or external interactions.\n   - The code is static, purely for type safety and static analysis purposes.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Risks & Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No dynamic code, no data flow, no external data sources, and no untrusted sinks.\n   - No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or anomalies.\n   - The code does not execute any logic, handle sensitive data, or interact with the system beyond type annotations.\n   - All reports agree on benignity, emphasizing the code's simplicity and static nature.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Report Scores:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - Since there's no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities, these scores are appropriate.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns & Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely declarative with no malicious intent.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here, given the static and benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Final Judgment & Recommendations:**\n   - The overall assessment aligns across all reports.\n   - The scores are reasonable and justified.\n   - No modifications are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, benign set of type alias definitions for static type checking. There are no security concerns, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
