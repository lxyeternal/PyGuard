  "purpose": "Define type aliases for categorization of search types, top categories, and sectors using Python's Literal for static type checking.",
  "sources": "None; static type alias definitions without data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; purely static declarations without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of static type alias definitions using 'Literal' from the 'typing' module. It does not include functions, data processing, or external interactions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs. The code's purpose is to improve type safety and code clarity in larger projects. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk 0, with high confidence. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present or implied. The code's static and declarative nature precludes any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as static type annotations for categorization. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
