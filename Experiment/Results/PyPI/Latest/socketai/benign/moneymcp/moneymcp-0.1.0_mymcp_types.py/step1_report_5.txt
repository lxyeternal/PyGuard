{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for search categories, top categories, and sectors used in data queries or configurations.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only type alias definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; type aliases are used for type hinting only.",
  "flows": "None, as the code only declares type aliases without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several Python type aliases using Literal to specify allowed string values for various categories. This is typical for type safety and code clarity. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic execution, and no potential injection points or malicious behavior. It is straightforward and serves as type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type alias definitions intended for use in a larger application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
