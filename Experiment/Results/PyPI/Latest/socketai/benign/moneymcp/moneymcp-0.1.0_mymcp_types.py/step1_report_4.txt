  "purpose": "Defines type aliases for search parameters and categories using Python's Literal type for type safety.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static type definitions",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "Use of Literal for defining fixed string options; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of type alias definitions using Python's typing.Literal for various categories related to search and financial data. No input/output, data processing, or external calls are present. The structure is straightforward and does not contain dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or potential entry points for malicious activity. The use of Literal enhances type safety but does not introduce security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, serving to enforce type constraints for search parameters. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
