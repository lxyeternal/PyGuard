  "purpose": "Define specific string literal types for categorization and filtering purposes within a larger application.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reads; only type definitions are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, output, or processing points for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or data handling paths; only static type annotations are defined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code consists solely of type aliases for static type checking.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Literal' from 'typing' and declares several type aliases using Literal to restrict variables to specific string values. These definitions serve as constraints for type checkers like mypy, aiding in code correctness. There are no dynamic or runtime behaviors, no data inputs or outputs, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The code is simple and intended for static type safety, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as type annotations for better code validation and readability. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
