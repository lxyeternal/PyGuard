  "purpose": "Define type aliases using Literal for categorization of search types, top types, and sectors.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of type alias definitions with string literals; no unusual or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward use of Python's typing.Literal to define specific allowed string values for different categories. There are no functions, data processing, or input/output operations. The code appears to serve as type annotations for other parts of a larger program, providing constraints on variable values. No signs of malicious or suspicious code, backdoors, or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign type alias declaration for categorization purposes. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
