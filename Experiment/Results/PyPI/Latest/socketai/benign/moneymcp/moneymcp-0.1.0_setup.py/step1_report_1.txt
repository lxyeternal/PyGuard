{
  "purpose": "Configure the setup for the 'moneymcp' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "User input is minimal; data is static within setup parameters. No external data reads or input handling observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing points present; setup configuration is static and self-contained.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs detected. No suspicious or malicious patterns evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It employs common patterns for Python package configuration without dynamic code execution, network activity, or input processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. All dependencies and entry points are typical for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard configuration file with no suspicious elements.",
