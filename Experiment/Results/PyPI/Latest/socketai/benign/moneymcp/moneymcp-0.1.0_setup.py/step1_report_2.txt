{
  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration for packaging and distributing the 'moneymcp' Python project",
  "sources": "None; the code only reads static package metadata, requirements, and entry point definitions",
  "sinks": "None; no handling of untrusted input or data",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and classifiers. There are no dynamic executions, input handling, or external data processing that could be exploited maliciously. All used packages are common and publicly available. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup configuration with no malicious behavior detected. It appears safe and adheres to standard practices for Python package distribution.",
