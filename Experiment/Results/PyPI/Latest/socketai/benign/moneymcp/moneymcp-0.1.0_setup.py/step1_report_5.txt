  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'moneymcp' with specified dependencies and entry points for installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation configuration.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data output or external communication code present.",
  "flows": "N/A; setup script primarily defines package configuration, no runtime data flow or input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors; standard setup configuration. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package details, dependencies, and entry points. All elements follow standard practices for Python packaging. No malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are visible. The dependencies are common data analysis libraries; no signs of malicious payloads or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical setup.py structure.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard configuration for distributing a financial analysis package.",
