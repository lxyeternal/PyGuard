  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup parameters for the Python package 'moneymcp', including dependencies, entry points, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points; no external data input is read.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the script primarily provides package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious patterns observed. Use of standard setup tools and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to specify package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. All elements are standard for Python package configuration. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation occurs. No hardcoded secrets or credential information present. The dependencies are common for data analysis and financial applications, with no suspicious packages or code behaviors. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
