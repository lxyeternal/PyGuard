{
  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, dependencies list, entry_points declaration",
  "sinks": "N/A (no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present)",
  "flows": "N/A (no runtime data flow; static configuration only)",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; straightforward and standard structure",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script employing setuptools. It contains static metadata, dependencies, and entry points without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or input processing. All dependencies are common and publicly available. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is declarative and follows standard practices for Python packaging. Given the static nature and lack of runtime behavior, there are no security concerns or malicious indicators. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and free from security issues or malicious behavior. The reports accurately assess the code as safe, and the assigned scores are justified and consistent with the static, non-malicious nature of the code.",
