  "purpose": "Provides a command line interface for configuring and running the mymcp financial analysis server.",
  "sources": "Reads command line arguments for host, port, and log level; sets environment variables accordingly.",
  "sinks": "Sets environment variables which are used by the server; calls the run_server function from mymcp.server.",
  "flows": "Command line args -> environment variables -> run_server()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; environment variables are set based on user input but are not sensitive by themselves; the import is deferred to avoid circular dependency, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script collects user input via command line arguments for host, port, and log level, then sets these as environment variables. It then calls an external function 'run_server' from the mymcp.server module. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The environment variables are used internally for configuration; they are not exposed or transmitted elsewhere. The code structure and logic are typical for server setup scripts, with no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration script for a server with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely collects configuration parameters and initiates server startup, with no sensitive data hardcoded or suspicious operations.",
