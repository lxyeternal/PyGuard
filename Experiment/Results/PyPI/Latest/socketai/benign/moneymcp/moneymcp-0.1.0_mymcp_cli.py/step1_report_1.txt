  "purpose": "Provide a command-line interface to configure and run the mymcp financial analysis server.",
  "sources": "Input sources are command-line arguments (--port, --host, --log-level).",
  "sinks": "Environment variables (MYMCP_HOST, MYMCP_PORT, MYMCP_LOG_LEVEL) set from command-line arguments; run_server() function is called.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> environment variables -> run_server() execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code patterns; environment variables are set from user input but are not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a CLI that sets environment variables based on user input and then calls an imported server function. The environment variables are used for configuration, not secret keys or sensitive data. The import is local to avoid circular dependencies. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code's structure appears standard for configuration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI setup for configuring and running a server. No malicious behavior or supply chain risks are evident. It simply passes user-provided parameters via environment variables to a server function.",
