  "purpose": "Provides a CLI for configuring and launching a server by setting environment variables based on user input.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments for host, port, and log level.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables set from user input; used downstream in run_server().",
  "flows": "Arguments parsed -> environment variables set -> run_server() invoked.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward server configuration CLI that accepts parameters, sets environment variables, and calls an external server function. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected. The environment variables are set from user input, which is standard but could pose risks if misused downstream; however, this is outside the scope of this code. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious behavior. The import is local to avoid circular dependencies, a common pattern. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard server configuration script with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain risks. The low risk score is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correct. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose security concerns.",
