  "purpose": "To provide a command-line interface for configuring and running the mymcp financial analysis server.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (--port, --host, --log-level) used to set environment variables for the server.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables (MYMCP_HOST, MYMCP_PORT, MYMCP_LOG_LEVEL) that influence server configuration.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are parsed, then environment variables are set, and finally the server is executed via run_server().",
  "anomalies": "None detected; environment variables are set based on user input, but this is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script securely parses command-line arguments with validation, then sets environment variables to configure the server. The import of run_server is done within the main() function to avoid circular dependencies. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or data leaks are present. The logic is straightforward, focusing on configuration and server startup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration script for a server application with no malicious intent. It does not include any suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware. The environment variable usage is consistent with typical configuration practices.",
