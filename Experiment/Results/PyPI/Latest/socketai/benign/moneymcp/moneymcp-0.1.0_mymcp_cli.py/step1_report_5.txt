{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a command-line interface to configure and run a financial analysis server, passing configuration via environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for port, host, and log level; reads environment variables set for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables potentially affecting server configuration; invocation of run_server() which may depend on environment variables.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> environment variables -> run_server()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Environment variables are set directly from user input, but this is standard for configuration. The import is delayed to avoid circular dependencies, which is common practice.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles argument parsing, environment variable setting, and invoking a server function. No data is transmitted over the network, no code injection mechanisms, and no suspicious behaviors. The environment variables are used for configuration, which is typical for server setup scripts. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration observed. The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard server configuration script without malicious behavior. It securely manages server configuration via user inputs and environment variables, with no evident security risks or malware indicators.",
