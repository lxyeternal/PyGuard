  "purpose": "Command line interface for starting the mymcp financial analysis server with configurable host, port, and log level settings.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command line arguments (--port, --host, --log-level).",
  "sinks": "Sets environment variables (MYMCP_HOST, MYMCP_PORT, MYMCP_LOG_LEVEL) that influence server behavior, and calls run_server() from mymcp.server.",
  "flows": "Command line args -> environment variables -> run_server() function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. The environment variables are set based on user input, which could influence server behavior but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script parses user-provided arguments for host, port, and log level. These values are stored in environment variables and then used by the server's main function. No direct data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The dynamic import of 'mymcp.server' and setting environment variables is typical for configurable server startup scripts. The code appears straightforward and intended for normal operation. No code injection, malicious data handling, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard command-line interface to configure and start a server, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The only potential concern is reliance on user input for environment variables, but this is standard practice in server configuration scripts. Overall, no malicious or security-threatening behavior is identified.",
