{
  "purpose": "Set up an MCP server with a simple addition tool and a greeting resource.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a', 'b', and 'name' in the add() and get_greeting() functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that generate output based on input parameters; no external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions and produce responses; no external data flows to untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of an external library 'fastmcp' appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'fastmcp' and creates an MCP server instance named 'Demo 🚀'. It defines a simple addition tool and a resource for personalized greeting. Both functions are straightforward, with no input validation, insecure operations, or external network interactions. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident. The structure is simple and typical for setting up an API server with predefined tools and resources.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup of an MCP server with basic functionalities. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. It functions as a basic service definition without suspicious code or external data leaks.",
