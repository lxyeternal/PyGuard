{
  "purpose": "This code defines a server using the FastMCP library with simple tools and resources for adding numbers and generating personalized greetings.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters 'a', 'b', and 'name' from function calls and URL path segments.",
  "sinks": "The functions return results directly, with no explicit sinks that handle untrusted data in a way that affects system security.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('a', 'b', 'name') are received through function invocation or URL routing and are returned as strings or integers without further processing or external system interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments are present. The use of emojis in the server name is unusual but harmless. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a library 'fastmcp' to create a server instance, adds a simple addition tool, and a resource that returns a greeting. Input parameters are straightforward and used directly in return statements. There are no indications of data leaks, malicious behavior, or security issues. The functions perform basic operations with no external calls, file operations, or environment variable usage that could pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign example demonstrating the use of the FastMCP library for creating simple tools and resources. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.",
