{
  "purpose": "To set up a FastMCP server with a simple addition tool and a personalized greeting resource.",
  "sources": "User input in the 'name' parameter of get_greeting, which is used directly in the returned string.",
  "sinks": "The 'name' parameter is directly included in the response string without validation or sanitization.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' from the resource URL flows into the get_greeting function, which returns a formatted string including the name.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Usage of dynamic URL resource parameter could potentially lead to code injection if further processing were involved, but here it is only used in string formatting without eval or exec.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a FastMCP server with a custom name. It defines a tool that adds two integers, which is straightforward and safe. It also defines a resource that generates a greeting based on a URL parameter. The parameter 'name' is directly interpolated into a string response, which could be problematic if further processing or evaluation were involved; however, in this case, it is simply formatted into a string. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities such as code injection, credential leaks, or system commands. The use of URL parameters for user input is standard, and no dangerous operations are performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign example of setting up a simple MCP server with user-input-based responses. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks evident in this code snippet.",
