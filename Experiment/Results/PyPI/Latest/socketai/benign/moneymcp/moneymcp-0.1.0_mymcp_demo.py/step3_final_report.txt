{
  "purpose": "Set up a FastMCP server with an addition tool and a dynamic greeting resource that uses URL parameters.",
  "sources": "URL parameter 'name' used in get_greeting; input parameters 'a' and 'b' in add function.",
  "sinks": "String formatting with 'name' in get_greeting; addition operation with 'a' and 'b'.",
  "flows": "User provides 'name' -> get_greeting returns formatted string; 'a' and 'b' -> add returns sum.",
  "anomalies": "Use of URL parameter 'name' directly in string formatting without validation; emojis in server name are unusual but harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a server with simple tools and resources, using user input directly in string responses. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The direct use of input in string formatting is generally safe here but could pose injection risks if further processing occurs. No external network activity or sensitive data handling is observed. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1), justified by the lack of validation but no active vulnerability. The code's simplicity and safe usage justify these scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minor security concern about unvalidated user input does not translate into an actual vulnerability in this context. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
