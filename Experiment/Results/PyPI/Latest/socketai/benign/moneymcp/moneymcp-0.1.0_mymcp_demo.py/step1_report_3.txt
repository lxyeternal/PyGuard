{
  "purpose": "Defines an MCP server with a tool for addition and a dynamic greeting resource.",
  "sources": "User inputs via the 'name' parameter in the 'greeting' resource.",
  "sinks": "The 'name' parameter is directly used in the return string, which could lead to injection if used improperly, but in this context it appears as string formatting only.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' from the resource endpoint flows into string formatting for the greeting message.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior observed. The code is straightforward and uses provided framework functions.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a FastMCP server named 'Demo 🚀', adds an addition tool that sums two integers, and a resource that returns a greeting based on the provided 'name'. There are no external data sources, environment variables, or network communications involved. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious injections are present. The usage of parameters in the greeting is simple string formatting, which does not inherently pose security risks in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple demonstration of using the FastMCP framework to set up a server with a tool and resource. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign sample implementation.",
