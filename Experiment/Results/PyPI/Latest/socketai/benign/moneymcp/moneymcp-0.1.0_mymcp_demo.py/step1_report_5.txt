{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a FastMCP server with a simple addition tool and a personalized greeting resource.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the parameters of the add function (a, b) and the resource path parameter (name) in get_greeting.",
  "sinks": "The data from parameters (a, b, name) is used directly in the functions. No external sinks or network operations are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a', 'b', and 'name' are used directly in return statements without validation, but they are only used for simple string concatenation or addition, which is safe in this context.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code are present. The code uses straightforward function definitions and annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a library 'fastmcp' and creates an instance of FastMCP with a name. It registers a tool 'add' that performs integer addition, and a resource 'greeting' that returns a personalized greeting based on input. There are no network operations, file I/O, or code that could be malicious. The functions are simple and do not contain any security risks. No malicious patterns or backdoors are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign example of setting up a FastMCP server with basic tools and resources. There are no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
