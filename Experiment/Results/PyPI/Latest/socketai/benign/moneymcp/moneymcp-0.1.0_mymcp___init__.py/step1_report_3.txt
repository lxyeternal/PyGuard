{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a financial analysis server library, exporting key types and an MCP object for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'mymcp.types' and 'mymcp.server' modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the imported 'mcp' object if it executes or exposes sensitive operations upon import.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules to exposing these via exports, with no runtime data processing or external input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module metadata and exports key components from internal modules. It imports 'Sector', 'TopType', and 'SearchType' from 'mymcp.types' and 'mcp' from 'mymcp.server'. There is no evidence of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The 'mcp' object could potentially contain sensitive operations, but without its implementation, no malicious activity can be inferred. The code appears to be a straightforward module setup without complex logic or external input processing.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a standard module initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply exports certain types and objects for external use. No malware or security threats are evident based on the provided code.",
