  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that provides a financial analysis tool with APIs for market data, likely serving as a library or server component.",
  "sources": "No direct input sources; imports modules that define types and server functionalities.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or perform network/file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is primarily import statements and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic. No obfuscated or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that sets a version string, imports specific components ('Sector', 'TopType', 'SearchType') from 'mymcp.types', and imports 'mcp' from 'mymcp.server'. It lacks any dynamic code, user input handling, or network activities. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on this fragment. The comments are in Chinese and English, describing module export intentions, which is standard documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign module initialization snippet for a financial analysis server library. It contains no malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code. It appears to be a standard, safe import and documentation pattern.",
