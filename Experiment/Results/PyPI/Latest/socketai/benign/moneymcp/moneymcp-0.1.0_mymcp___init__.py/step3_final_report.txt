{
  "purpose": "Module providing version info, importing key types and the main 'mcp' object for a financial analysis server setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'mymcp.types' and 'mymcp.server', setting version string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or user input handling present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and version assignment; no data flow from external sources or to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious constructs; straightforward setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup module with version info and imports, containing no functions, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The only potential concern is the 'mcp' object, which could contain sensitive or executable code, but without its implementation, no malicious activity can be inferred. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of this code snippet. Given the lack of external data handling or dynamic code, the overall security risk remains very low.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minimal risk score is appropriate, considering the potential but unverified contents of 'mcp'. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.",
