{
  "purpose": "Provides metadata and imports key components for a financial analysis tool and server API",
  "sources": "Imports from mymcp.types and mymcp.server modules",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sources or sinks present in the code",
  "flows": "N/A, the code primarily defines imports and version info without data flow",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a brief module docstring, version definition, and two import statements importing specific classes and objects from the mymcp package. There are no functions, data processing, or external input handling present. The imports appear to be for defining the API's interface. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident, and no sensitive data handling occurs in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup for a financial analysis server, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly initializes the module's version and exposes components from the mymcp package for external use.",
