  "purpose": "Defines a financial analysis server with version info and imports key types and MCP object for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'mymcp.types' and 'mymcp.server'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or user input processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and sets metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward module import and metadata setting with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up module metadata, imports types and server object, and does not execute any dynamic or potentially malicious code. There are no hardcoded credentials, network connections, or data handling that could indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be a standard module setup for a larger package.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only establishes version info and exports key components for external use.",
