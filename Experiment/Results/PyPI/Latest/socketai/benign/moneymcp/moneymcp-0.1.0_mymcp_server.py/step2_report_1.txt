  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically, considering the code, the logical consistency of the findings, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All five reports consistently identify that the code is primarily a set of functions for retrieving financial data from APIs (Yahoo Finance, Finnhub, FRED). \n- They highlight that API keys are embedded directly in the code, which is a security concern but not malicious.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as obfuscated code, code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration, are detected.\n- The functions are straightforward, with clear data flows from external APIs to JSON responses.\n- The overall confidence in the security assessment is high (around 0.9-0.95), with the malware score at 0.\n- The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), mainly due to embedded API keys, which is a best practice violation but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code presence:** No malicious or suspicious code is present.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws beyond API key exposure.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **API keys:** Hardcoded, which is a security concern but not malicious.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The main concern is API key exposure, not code sabotage or malware.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Suspicious assumptions:** No, all assessments are based on code behavior and data flow analysis.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are reasonable.\n- The high confidence levels are justified given the straightforward, transparent nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1-0.2** — primarily due to API key exposure, which is a security best practice violation but not malicious.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.15 (due to API key exposure)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, transparent set of tools for financial data retrieval. The security concern is API key management, not malicious intent or sabotage.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed to the scores. The analysis aligns with the code's behavior and the provided reports.",
