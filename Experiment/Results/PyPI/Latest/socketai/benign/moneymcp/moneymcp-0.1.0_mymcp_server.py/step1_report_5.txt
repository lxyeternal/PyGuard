{
  "purpose": "The code provides tools for financial data retrieval and analysis, including accessing stock, economic, and market information from multiple APIs and data sources.",
  "sources": "External API calls to Finnhub, Fred, Yahoo Finance, and pandas data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes to files, executes system commands, or transmits untrusted data outside controlled API calls. API responses are processed and returned as JSON strings.",
  "flows": "Input parameters from API calls flow into external API requests (Finnhub, Fred, Yahoo Finance), then responses are formatted into JSON and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials are visible; API keys are hardcoded but this is common in testing/development environments, not necessarily malicious. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors detected. The code extensively uses API calls to reputable data sources for financial info, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of functions for financial data retrieval, including stock info, news, historical data, economic indicators, and market sector analysis. All API keys are hardcoded but are used solely for data fetching. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, command execution, or code injection. No malicious behaviors such as system compromise, data theft, or covert communication are present. The code appears to be legitimate tools for financial analysis, with clearly defined data flows and no suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of financial data retrieval functions with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It relies on reputable APIs and processes data for analytical purposes without any indication of malware, covert channels, or security risks.",
