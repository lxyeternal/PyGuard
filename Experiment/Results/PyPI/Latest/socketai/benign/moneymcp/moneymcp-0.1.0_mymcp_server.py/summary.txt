  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent set of functions for financial data analysis. There is no evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the hardcoded API keys, which should be managed securely outside the code. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 due to API key exposure. Overall, the supply chain security risk is minimal, and the code is safe for use with proper API key management."
