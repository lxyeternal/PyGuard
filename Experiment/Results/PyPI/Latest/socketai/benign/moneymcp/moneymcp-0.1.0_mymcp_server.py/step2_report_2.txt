  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to determine if the issues are present, assess the reasoning, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes legitimate API interactions, no untrusted input, no dynamic code execution.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from API responses to JSON return; no file/network writes beyond API calls.  \n- **Anomalies:** API keys are hardcoded, which is a security concern but not malicious.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malware, sabotage, or obfuscation. The reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 (due to hardcoded keys).  \n**Verdict:** Accurate. No malicious behavior detected. The low security risk score is justified.  \n**Adjusted malware score:** 0.0  \n**Overall:** The reasoning is correct; the code is a legitimate data retrieval tool.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to report 1, focusing on data retrieval from APIs.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are straightforward; no suspicious activity.  \n- **Anomalies:** API keys embedded, security concern but no malicious intent.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malware, sabotage, or obfuscation detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 justified.  \n**Verdict:** Correct. The code is a legitimate API client library.  \n**Adjusted malware score:** 0.0  \n**Overall:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, comprehensive API-based data retrieval.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from APIs to JSON responses; no external code execution.  \n- **Anomalies:** API keys are hardcoded, security concern but not malicious.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 justified.  \n**Verdict:** Correct. The code is a legitimate data access module.  \n**Adjusted malware score:** 0.0  \n**Overall:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Data retrieval functions, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data from APIs to JSON, no destructive actions.  \n- **Anomalies:** API keys embedded, security concern but not malicious.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 justified.  \n**Verdict:** Correct. The code is a standard data retrieval set.  \n**Adjusted malware score:** 0.0  \n**Overall:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, fetching data from reputable APIs.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are straightforward; no malicious behavior.  \n- **Anomalies:** API keys are hardcoded, security concern but not malicious.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malware, sabotage, or obfuscation detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 justified.  \n**Verdict:** Correct. The code is a legitimate data access layer.  \n**Adjusted malware score:** 0.0  \n**Overall:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code is primarily a set of API client functions for financial data retrieval.**\n- **No malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation detected in any report.**\n- **The main security concern is the hardcoded API keys, which is a common security best practice violation but not malicious.**\n- **Scores for malware are consistently 0 across reports, which is appropriate.**\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher than 0.1-0.2 due to embedded API keys, but not significantly. I suggest **0.1** for a conservative estimate, acknowledging the security concern but no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, transparent, and well-structured set of tools for financial data analysis. There are no signs of sabotage, malware, or obfuscation. The main security issue is the embedding of API keys, which should be managed securely but does not constitute malicious activity.\n\n**My final scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to API key handling, not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The supply chain security risk is minimal; the code is safe for deployment with proper API key management.",
