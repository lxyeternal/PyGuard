{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point to run the 'mymcp' package as a script, facilitating command-line execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'mymcp.cli' to import the 'main' function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data could leak; the code simply calls an imported function.",
  "flows": "The script imports 'main' from 'mymcp.cli' and executes it if the script is run directly, but there are no data flows involving untrusted input or external systems within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward and typical for a Python package entry point.",
  "analysis": "This script is a minimal entry point that imports and executes a main function from a submodule. It contains no suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, or complex behaviors. It relies entirely on the 'main' function from 'mymcp.cli', which is not provided here. As such, this appears to be standard boilerplate code for a Python CLI package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard entry point for a Python package without any signs of malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain any malicious code or suspicious behavior within this fragment.",
