{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point to run the 'mymcp' package using Python's module execution syntax.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'main' function from 'mymcp.cli' module.",
  "sinks": "Calls the 'main()' function, which may contain further logic; no direct untrusted data sinks in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Execution flows from the script invocation to the 'main()' function imported from 'mymcp.cli'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the script is straightforward and typical for Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard entry point for a Python package, importing a main function and executing it if run as the main module. No external inputs are read in this snippet, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The structure suggests it's a normal package startup script, with no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical and benign entry point script for a Python package. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks based on this code alone.",
