  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no malicious or suspicious features. The security posture relies on the implementation of main() in mymcp.cli, which should be reviewed separately. Based solely on this snippet, there are no indications of malware or obfuscation, and the security risk is minimal."
