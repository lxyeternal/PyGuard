{
  "purpose": "This script serves as the entry point for executing the 'mymcp' package as a command-line tool.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'main' function from 'mymcp.cli'. No external or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The 'main' function is called when the script runs, which could potentially be a sink if it executes malicious code. However, without its implementation, this cannot be confirmed.",
  "flows": "The script flow is straightforward: when run as the main module, it calls 'main()' from 'mymcp.cli'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code is minimal and standard for a Python package entry point.",
  "analysis": "The script simply acts as an entry point to invoke 'main' from 'mymcp.cli'. There are no data inputs, external connections, or suspicious behaviors evident. The potential security concern depends on the implementation of 'main()', which is not provided. The code structure is typical for Python packages, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign entry point script for a Python package. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident within this code fragment.",
