{
  "purpose": "To serve as the entry point for running the mymcp package via command line, enabling execution with 'python -m mymcp'.",
  "sources": "Importing the main function from mymcp.cli; execution trigger in the '__main__' block.",
  "sinks": "Call to the main() function in the '__main__' block; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "Execution flows from the script invocation to the main() function imported from mymcp.cli.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for a Python CLI entry point.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a main function from a submodule and executes it when run directly. It serves as a simple, conventional CLI entry point without any input handling, data processing, or external communication. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code does not perform any malicious activities or suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI entry point for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intentionally minimal.",
