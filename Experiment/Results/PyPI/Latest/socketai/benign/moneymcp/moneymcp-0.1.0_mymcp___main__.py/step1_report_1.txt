{
  "purpose": "To serve as the entry point for running the mymcp package as a command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'main' from 'mymcp.cli'",
  "sinks": "Calling 'main()' function which may execute arbitrary code depending on its implementation",
  "flows": "The script invokes 'main()', which potentially processes command-line input or performs actions based on 'mymcp.cli' logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code features; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard entry point for a Python package. It imports a main function and executes it if the script is run directly. The structure is typical for CLI packages and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. Since the core functionality depends on 'main()', which is external, the security assessment cannot extend beyond this script. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious code are evident in this minimal entry point.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign entry point for a Python package without any signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The potential security risk depends on the implementation of 'main()' in 'mymcp.cli', which is outside the scope of this script.",
