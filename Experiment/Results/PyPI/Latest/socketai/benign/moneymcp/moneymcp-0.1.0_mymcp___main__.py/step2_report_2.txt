  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a minimal, standard entry point for a Python CLI package.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The core concern is the call to `main()` imported from `mymcp.cli`, which could execute arbitrary code depending on its implementation, but that implementation is outside the scope of this script.\n- The malware scores are all zero, indicating no malicious activity is detected or claimed.\n- The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which aligns with the benign nature of this minimal script.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns.\n- The risk of malicious behavior depends entirely on the implementation of `main()` in `mymcp.cli`, which is not provided.\n- The reports correctly identify that this is boilerplate code, typical for CLI entry points.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- Since all reports agree on the benign nature of this code, and no suspicious features are present, I see no reason to adjust the scores significantly.\n- The malware score remains at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk score is appropriately low, given the minimal nature of the script.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 is reasonable, considering the potential risk if `main()` is malicious, but the script itself is benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard, benign entry point for a Python CLI package. The actual security implications depend on the implementation of `main()` in `mymcp.cli`, which is outside this scope. Based on the provided code and reports, I agree with the current scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's simplicity.",
