  "purpose": "Minimal Python entry point script that imports and executes the main function from mymcp.cli when run directly.",
  "sources": "Import statement for mymcp.cli and the __main__ check invoking main()",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() which may process untrusted input or perform actions depending on its implementation",
  "flows": "Import of main() -> if __name__ == '__main__' -> main() execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward boilerplate code with no suspicious or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python CLI entry point that imports main() from mymcp.cli and executes it if run as a script. It contains no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of main(), which is outside this snippet. The code itself is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9-1), given the simplicity and standard structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no malicious or suspicious features. The security posture relies on the implementation of main() in mymcp.cli, which should be reviewed separately. Based solely on this snippet, there are no indications of malware or obfuscation, and the security risk is minimal.",
