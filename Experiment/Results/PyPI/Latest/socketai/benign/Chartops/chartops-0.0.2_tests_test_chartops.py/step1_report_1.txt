  "anomalies": "Contains only boilerplate test code with no actual test logic, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal test skeleton for the `chartops` package, importing modules and defining empty test cases. No user input, data handling, or external communication occurs. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. It appears to be a standard testing stub with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test skeleton with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
