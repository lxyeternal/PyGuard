  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this is a standard test scaffold.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any code executing untrusted input, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple unittest skeleton importing the 'chartops' package and defining a basic test class. It contains no code that reads external input or handles untrusted data. There are no potential security vulnerabilities, no suspicious or malicious code segments, and no obfuscated code features. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python test modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test scaffold with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, safe unit test template for the 'chartops' package.",
