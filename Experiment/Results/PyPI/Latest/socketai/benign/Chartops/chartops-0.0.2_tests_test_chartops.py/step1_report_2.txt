  "purpose": "This code appears to be a basic unit test template for the `chartops` package.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; standard import statements from a package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a minimal boilerplate for testing with no actual implementation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the unittest module and a package named chartops. It defines a test class with setup, teardown, and a placeholder test method. There are no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, or other suspicious activities. The code is purely structural and intended for testing purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, non-malicious test scaffold with no evidence of malware or security risks. It appears to be standard testing boilerplate code without any malicious or anomalous elements.",
