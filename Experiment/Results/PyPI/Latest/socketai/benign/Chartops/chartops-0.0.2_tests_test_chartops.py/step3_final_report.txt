  "purpose": "A minimal Python unittest scaffold for the `chartops` package, serving as a placeholder for future tests.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`unittest`, `chartops`), class definition, setup/teardown methods, placeholder test method.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or produce output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code contains only structural boilerplate with no execution paths involving data or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of actual test logic, data handling, or external communication; no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, benign test scaffold with no dynamic behavior, external calls, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify it as a harmless, minimal structure. The scores assigned (malware: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.0, securityRisk: 0.0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test scaffold with no malicious intent or security risks. The provided reports are accurate, and the scoring is consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
  "malware": 0.0,
