{
  "purpose": "This code provides unit tests for the 'chartops' package, mainly for testing functionalities within that package.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'chartops' module, which may load the package but does not directly read external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations are detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets up test structure.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of actual test logic, placeholders only, no suspicious code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test skeleton using the unittest framework, importing the package under test. It contains no actual test logic, no input handling, or output operations. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious patterns are present. The structure is typical for initial test scaffolding.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard test scaffold with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a template for future tests. No issues are detected.",
