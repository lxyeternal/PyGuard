  "purpose": "A command-line interface script for the 'chartops' tool, intended to process command-line arguments and provide output.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse from sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Outputs argument list to stdout using print(). No untrusted data is sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv is processed by argparse, then printed; no further data flows or external interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The print statement appears to be a placeholder comment indicating incomplete implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI script that parses command-line arguments and prints them. It uses standard libraries (argparse and sys). The main function is straightforward, with no external data fetching, no network activity, and no malicious behavior detected. The placeholder message suggests this is a template or incomplete code, but nothing malicious is embedded. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a basic CLI tool with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a simple placeholder or scaffold for further development.",
