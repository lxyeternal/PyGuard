{
  "purpose": "To serve as a console script for the 'chartops' package, processing command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse from sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout using print; no untrusted data handling or external system calls.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (args._) -> printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a placeholder message indicating that core functionality should be implemented in 'chartops.cli.main', but currently only prints arguments. No other suspicious or unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a basic CLI interface, capturing arguments into args._, then printing them. The placeholder message suggests this is a stub or scaffold for further development. No hardcoded secrets, no system modifications, no external calls, no code injection, and no malicious behavior detected. The code appears straightforward and typical for CLI scaffolding.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a simple CLI stub with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions and appears to be part of a larger project where functionality is yet to be implemented.",
