{
  "purpose": "The code is a basic command-line interface script that processes command-line arguments and prints them out.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse from sys.argv (implicitly through argparse).",
  "sinks": "Print statements which output argument data to stdout.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments → argparse parsing → printing arguments.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious functions. The code simply prints input arguments without further processing.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes an argument parser, accepts any number of positional arguments, and then prints these arguments. There are no network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The placeholder message indicates where actual code should be implemented. No obfuscation or unusual language features are present. The structure and functions are straightforward and typical for a CLI utility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI template with no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
