  "purpose": "A minimal CLI scaffold that parses command-line arguments and prints them.",
  "sources": "argparse.ArgumentParser() reading command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "print() function outputting argument list",
  "flows": "Arguments parsed by argparse -> printed via print()",
  "anomalies": "Placeholder comment referencing 'chartops.cli.main' which is non-executable and typical in scaffolding code",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI template with no network activity, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, and no suspicious functions. It simply parses positional arguments and prints them. The placeholder comment is benign and indicates incomplete implementation, not malicious intent. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and placeholder nature. The high confidence scores reflect the clear benign assessment. Overall, the code poses no security threat and is a standard scaffold.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's simplicity. No modifications are necessary.",
