  "purpose": "This code defines static package metadata (__author__, __email__, __version__) with no executable logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only static variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; code contains only static metadata assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments for package metadata, with no input/output, data flows, or executable logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code's simplicity and static nature imply negligible security risk. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, metadata-only, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate and consistent with its nature. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
