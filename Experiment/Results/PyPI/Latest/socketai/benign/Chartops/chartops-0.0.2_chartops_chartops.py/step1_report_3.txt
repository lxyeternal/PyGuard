  "purpose": "Main module",
  "sources": "None identified; the code does not read input or data",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data output or external interactions",
  "flows": "No data flow present",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a comment and no executable statements, which is unusual for a main module but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of a comment indicating 'Main module' with no executable code, functions, or data interactions. There are no sources or sinks, and no data flows. The lack of implementation might suggest an incomplete module or a placeholder, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security concerns. It appears to be a placeholder or a minimal main module with no active logic.",
