  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code simply defines a function `hello_world()` that prints \"Hello World!\".\n   - There are no external inputs, data processing, or external dependencies.\n   - The code is static and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or flaws are identified across the reports.\n   - The code's purpose and behavior are consistent and benign.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n3. **Score Consistency and Justification:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely a utility function with no malicious or risky behavior, a `securityRisk` score of 0 is justified.\n   - The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious intent.\n   - Obfuscation is correctly scored as 0.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions or Misinterpretations:**\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities are made, and none are evident.\n   - The code is very simple; there are no hidden behaviors or complex logic to analyze.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a trivial utility function with no security concerns. The reports are thorough and accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
