{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function that prints 'Hello World!' to the console, serving as a basic utility or example function.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data sources, or environment variables are read; the code is static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communications; the function only outputs to the console via print().",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the function is static and self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static function with no dependencies, inputs, or external interactions. It performs a benign print operation, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature and assign scores accordingly. The code's simplicity and lack of external data or network activity confirm its low threat profile.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
