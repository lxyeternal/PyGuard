  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project named 'mine_lead', defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, open('README.rst'), find_packages(where='src')",
  "sinks": "None directly, as the script primarily defines package metadata and dependencies",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Use of open() to read README file is standard. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and setuptools modules, calculates a maximum Python version for classifier inclusion, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. No untrusted input is processed beyond reading a local README file, which is typical. No indicators of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The use of find_packages with a specific directory is standard for source-based packaging. The code is straightforward and adheres to normal packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be legitimate, standard code for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious data handling, or security risks.",
