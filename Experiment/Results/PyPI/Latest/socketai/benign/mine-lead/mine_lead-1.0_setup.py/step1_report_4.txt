{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'mine_lead', defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading sys.version_info, reading 'README.rst' file, importing setup and find_packages modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only reads local files and system info for setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of dynamic Python version range is benign.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and setuptools modules to configure package installation. It calculates max Python version info for classifiers. It reads a local README file for long description. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. All data sources are static or system-provided, and no untrusted data is processed or transmitted. The package dependencies are standard and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script appears benign, serving only to configure package metadata and dependencies. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
