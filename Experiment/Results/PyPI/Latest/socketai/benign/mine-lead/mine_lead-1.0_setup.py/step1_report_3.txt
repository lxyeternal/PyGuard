{
  "purpose": "To configure and set up a Python package named 'mine_lead' for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading sys.version_info, reading 'README.rst' file for long description",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems",
  "flows": "Reading Python version info and package description; no data flow to external sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; dynamic generation of Python version classifiers is benign and standard",
  "analysis": "The script uses 'sys.version_info' to determine Python version ranges for classifiers, which is a common practice. It reads a local README file for the long description, which is standard. There are no suspicious or malicious functions, external network interactions, or obfuscated code present. The code strictly adheres to package setup conventions without any unusual behavior or hidden payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security issues. It performs typical package configuration tasks securely and transparently.",
