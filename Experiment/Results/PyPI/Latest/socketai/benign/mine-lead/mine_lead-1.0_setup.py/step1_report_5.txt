  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'mine_lead' Python project.",
  "sources": "Reads system version info (sys.version_info), reads 'README.rst' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info influences package classifiers; reading 'README.rst' for description.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read a README file is normal; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for packaging, dynamically sets Python version classifiers based on the runtime environment, and reads a README file for long description. All actions are typical for a setup.py script. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or hidden backdoors. The use of 'requests' as a dependency is standard and not suspicious. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
