  "purpose": "Import statements for local modules related to machine learning responses and email search responses.",
  "sources": "Import statements at the beginning of the code that load classes MLResponse, MLSearchEmailResponse, and MLSearchResponse from relative modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing, only import statements; no untrusted data handling or output points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code only imports classes without executing or passing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code consists solely of import statements with relative module references.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of relative import statements for three modules. There are no functions, data handling, or executable code that could introduce security risks. Since the code only imports classes from local modules, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious data flow. The code does not perform any network activity, data manipulation, or sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of import statements without any malicious intent or security risks. It simply loads necessary classes from local modules, which is standard practice in Python projects.",
