{
  "purpose": "The code imports three classes related to machine learning responses and email search responses, likely for use within a larger application handling ML-based functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from external modules within the same package directory: MLResponse, MLSearchEmailResponse, and MLSearchResponse.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present; the code only performs import statements without executing data handling or processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident; import statements do not involve data processing or untrusted data passing within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only straightforward import statements with relative paths; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing classes from the current package. There are no input sources, data processing, or data sinks. The code appears to be a standard module import section, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues. The simplicity and clarity suggest legitimate usage within a package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and consists only of standard import statements. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks within this snippet.",
