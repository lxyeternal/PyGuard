  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity is mentioned.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0 or 0.1, indicating minimal or no risk.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code snippet is just three import statements:\n```python\nfrom .MLResponse import MLResponse\nfrom .MLSearchEmailResponse import MLSearchEmailResponse\nfrom .MLSearchResponse import MLSearchResponse\n```\n- These are standard Python relative imports, typical in modular packages.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks are evident.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are apparent in the reasoning.\n- The scores align well with the code's nature.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** all reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** all assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal risk. Given the code's simplicity, 0 is more appropriate.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code only imports classes from local modules without executing any code or handling data, the risk is negligible.\n- The small securityRisk score of 0.1 in some reports seems arbitrary; a score of 0 would be more accurate unless additional context suggests otherwise.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here; the code is straightforward.\n- No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is indicated.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is standard import statements with no security concerns. The scores should be adjusted to reflect the minimal risk:\n\n**Recommended scores:**\n- **malware:** 0\n- **obfuscated:** 0\n- **securityRisk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet is entirely benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current assessments are appropriate, but the securityRisk score should be lowered to 0 for precision.",
