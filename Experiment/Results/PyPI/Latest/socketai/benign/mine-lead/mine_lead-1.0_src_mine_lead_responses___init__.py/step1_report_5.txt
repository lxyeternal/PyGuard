{
  "purpose": "This code imports three classes from local modules, likely for use in a larger application related to machine learning responses and email searches.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading from local module files (.MLResponse, .MLSearchEmailResponse, .MLSearchResponse)",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing present; no data leak or effect sources identified",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data transfer paths identified; code only imports classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed; standard import statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for local modules, with no execution or processing logic. It does not interact with external data sources, nor does it contain any suspicious or malicious constructs. Import statements are standard Python practices and do not pose security risks by themselves. The code's purpose appears to be to include specific classes from sibling modules for further use.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, performing simple class imports without any suspicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation, malware, or anomalies.",
