  "purpose": "Importing specific classes from local modules for use in the current package or project.",
  "sources": "The 'from' statements import classes from relative modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three import statements importing classes from relative modules. These are standard Python import statements for internal package components, with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. There is no hardcoded data, no code execution, and no apparent malicious intent. As this is just import statements, the security risk is minimal. The code appears to be part of a module setup or package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import of classes from local modules, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a normal part of a Python package's internal structure.",
