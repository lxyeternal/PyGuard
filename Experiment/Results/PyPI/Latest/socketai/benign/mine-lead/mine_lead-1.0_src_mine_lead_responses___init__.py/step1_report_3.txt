  "purpose": "Importing classes related to machine learning responses and search responses, likely for use within a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the current package directory (.MLResponse, .MLSearchEmailResponse, .MLSearchResponse)",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output occurring in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flows are established in this snippet; it only imports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and follows standard import syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple relative imports of three classes from the same package. It contains no executable logic, no data handling, and no suspicious patterns. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. The import statements are typical for modular codebases, used to include class definitions for further use.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely to import classes for further use. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks present in this snippet.",
