  "purpose": "This code imports three classes from local modules, likely for use within a package or application.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the module files (.MLResponse, .MLSearchEmailResponse, .MLSearchResponse).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing classes; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of straightforward import statements with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple set of relative import statements importing classes from local modules. There is no dynamic code execution, data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The import statements are standard practice in modular Python packages. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious behavior. The obfuscated score is 0, given the straightforward syntax. The security risk score is 0, as the code does not perform any operations that could introduce vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, and no further security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, consisting solely of standard import statements. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk present. The scores should be set to malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 for an accurate reflection of its safety.",
