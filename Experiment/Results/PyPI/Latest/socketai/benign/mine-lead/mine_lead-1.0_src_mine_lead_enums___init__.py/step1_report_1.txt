  "purpose": "Import the MLSearchStatus class or object from a local module named MLSearchStatus.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module or file MLSearchStatus.py.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external communication present in this line.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this line only performs a local import without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the import appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing MLSearchStatus from a relative module. This is a typical pattern in Python for modular code organization. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The import could be malicious if the MLSearchStatus module itself contains malicious code, but based solely on this line, there is no indication of malicious intent or activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal, assuming the imported module is trustworthy.",
