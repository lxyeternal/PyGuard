  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code carefully.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom .MLSearchStatus import MLSearchStatus\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The code is a standard relative import statement importing `MLSearchStatus` from a local module/file.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malicious activity in this line. It is a typical import statement.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All reports describe the same import statement, emphasizing that it is a straightforward, standard Python import.\n- No untrusted data, external communication, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), and the malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores are all 0.\n\n### Logical assessment:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Based solely on this import statement, **no** malicious or security issues are evident. The reports correctly identify it as a normal import.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in the reports:**  \n  The reports are consistent and thorough in their analysis. They correctly conclude that this is a benign, standard import statement with no security risks.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  The malware scores are 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The securityRisk scores are low, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n- **Justification for higher scores:**  \n  Since the code is just an import, raising the risk or malware scores would be unjustified unless additional context suggests malicious intent. The reports do not provide such context.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n  No assumptions are made beyond the code snippet, and none are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 or 0 (since minimal risk is inherent in any code, but this is negligible)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very minimal, standard import)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis import statement is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
