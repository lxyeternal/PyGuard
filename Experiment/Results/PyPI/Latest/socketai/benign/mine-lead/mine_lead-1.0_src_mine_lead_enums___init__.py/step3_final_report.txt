  "purpose": "This code imports the MLSearchStatus class or object from a local module, serving as a standard import statement in a Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module '.MLSearchStatus' to import 'MLSearchStatus'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing 'MLSearchStatus' from the local module; no data flows or external interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are detected in this import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import in Python, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as a benign, standard import. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the security risk is minimal (around 0.1), reflecting the low threat level of such an import. The confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious signals are present, and the code does not involve untrusted data or external communication.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and poses no security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's nature, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
