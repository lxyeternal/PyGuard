  "purpose": "Analyzes Python package code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, data flows, and suspicious constructs.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network inputs, URLs, environment data, external files, system commands.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file storage, subprocess execution, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into network transmission, file operations, or code execution points.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded URLs or credentials, use of eval/exec, dynamic imports, obfuscation, suspicious network activity, hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code in Report 3 exhibits multiple suspicious behaviors including hardcoded URLs, credentials, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, and data exfiltration indicators, justifying a malware score of 0.6 and obfuscation score of 0.7. Other reports show benign patterns with no suspicious activity, consistent with their low scores. The data flows and sources in benign reports do not lead to malicious sinks, and no anomalies are present. The scores align with the observed behaviors and code structures.",
  "conclusion": "Report 3 demonstrates likely malicious intent with obfuscation and suspicious data handling, warranting higher malware and risk scores. The other reports are benign, with scores appropriately reflecting their safety. Overall, the supply chain security posture is acceptable, with one report indicating potential malicious activity.",
