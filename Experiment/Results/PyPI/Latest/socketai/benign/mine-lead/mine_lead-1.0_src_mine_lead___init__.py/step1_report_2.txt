  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script or module with no explicit comments or documentation indicating its purpose. Without additional context, its primary function cannot be determined conclusively.",
  "sources": "Input is not explicitly read from external sources such as files, network, or environment variables. The code may contain hardcoded data or defaults, but none are explicitly visible in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file operations, or subprocess calls, but no such actions are evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no clear data flows from external sources to sinks within the provided code. The code executes internal logic without external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, such as obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hardcoded credentials, are present. The code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review shows the code is either incomplete or very minimal, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It lacks external data handling, suspicious operations, or complex logic that could hide malicious intent. The absence of external communication or data exfiltration points to a low likelihood of malicious activity. Due to limited code, confidence in analysis is high, but the overall security assessment is limited by the snippet's brevity.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities. The code appears benign and does not pose an immediate security threat.",
