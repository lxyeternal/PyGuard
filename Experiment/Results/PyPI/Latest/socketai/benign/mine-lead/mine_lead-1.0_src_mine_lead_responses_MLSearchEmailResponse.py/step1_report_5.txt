{
  "purpose": "Define a subclass for email response handling, extending MLResponse with additional email-related attributes.",
  "sources": "Input data parameter in __init__ method, imported module src.mine_lead.responses",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external data outputs are visible",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameter in __init__ to superclass initialization; no other data flows detected",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; simple data class extension",
  "analysis": "The code imports a response class and extends it with additional attributes for email, verified, and saved status. The __init__ method calls the superclass constructor with data. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed; no external network calls, code injection, or data leaks are present. The code appears to be a straightforward data model definition without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines a simple data extension class with no evident malicious or security concerns. It appears to be a legitimate component for handling email responses within a larger system.",
