  "purpose": "Define a subclass MLSearchEmailResponse extending MLResponse, with additional attributes for email, verification, and saved status.",
  "sources": "The data parameter in the constructor, imported module src.mine_lead.responses.MLResponse",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data is directly written to external systems or files within this snippet",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input 'data' parameter into the superclass constructor; no other data flow evident",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed. The class defines simple attributes and a constructor delegating to the parent class",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass with additional attributes, initializing via a constructor that calls the parent class's constructor. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. There is no data leakage, insecure code, or malicious activity. No obfuscation or malware-like patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward class definition for handling email response data, extending an existing response class. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
