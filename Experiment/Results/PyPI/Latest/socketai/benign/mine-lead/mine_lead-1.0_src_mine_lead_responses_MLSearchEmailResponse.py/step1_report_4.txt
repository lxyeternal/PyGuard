{
  "purpose": "Define a response class for email search results, extending MLResponse with additional email-related attributes.",
  "sources": "The class initialization method takes 'data' as input, which is passed to the superclass constructor.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling is explicitly shown; the code does not process or output untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input 'data' parameter through the superclass constructor; no other data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data model class with type annotations and default values. The constructor calls the parent constructor with the provided data, likely to initialize the object based on input. There are no suspicious behaviors, no external calls, and no security issues observed. It appears to be standard class inheritance and attribute definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward class definition for handling email response data, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any network activity, data leakage, or hidden operations.",
