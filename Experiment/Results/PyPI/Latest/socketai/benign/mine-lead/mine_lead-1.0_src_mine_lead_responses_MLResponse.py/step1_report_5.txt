{
  "purpose": "A simple class intended to dynamically assign attributes from a data dictionary and provide a string representation.",
  "sources": "Initialization method (__init__) reading the 'data' parameter, which is assigned to the object's __dict__.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method converting the class name and __dict__ to a string; no untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'data' parameter to the object's __dict__, then to the string representation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The dynamic assignment via __dict__ could potentially be misused if untrusted data is passed, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The class assigns the 'data' dictionary directly to the instance's __dict__, allowing dynamic attributes. The __str__ method provides a class name and attribute dump. No suspicious operations, external data handling, or malicious behavior are present. The only potential concern is if untrusted data is passed to the constructor, which could create unexpected attributes, but this is a typical pattern and not malicious by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and does not contain malicious behavior or malware. It simply provides a dynamic attribute container with a string representation. No security risks are evident.",
