  "purpose": "Define a class for handling machine learning responses with customizable data storage.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'data' in the __init__ method, which is assigned to the object's __dict__.",
  "sinks": "The __dict__ assignment could be a potential sink if 'data' contains malicious code, but in typical usage, it is just data assignment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input parameter 'data' to the object's __dict__, affecting the __str__ method output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The code directly assigns data to __dict__, which could be risky if 'data' is malicious, but as-is, it is standard practice for dynamic data assignment.",
  "analysis": "The class initializes by assigning the input 'data' to the object's __dict__, enabling dynamic attribute creation. The __str__ method returns the class name and its current attribute dictionary as a string. There are no evident malicious behaviors such as network activity, code execution, or backdoors. The main concern could be if 'data' is untrusted, which might lead to unintended attribute injection or modification, but this is a typical pattern for flexible data models.\n\nNo signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident in this code snippet. It is a simple data holder class with a straightforward string representation method.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic class for storing and representing data; it contains no malicious behavior or security issues. Its use of dynamic attribute assignment could be risky if 'data' is untrusted, but this is not inherently malicious. Overall, the code appears benign.",
