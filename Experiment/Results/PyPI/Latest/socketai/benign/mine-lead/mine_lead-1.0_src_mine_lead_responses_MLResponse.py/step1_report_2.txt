{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for representing machine learning responses with dynamic attribute assignment.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameter 'data' which can be any dictionary-like object; self.__dict__ assignment.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data is sent to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Data from 'data' source flows into object attributes via self.__dict__ = data.",
  "anomalies": "Assigning to self.__dict__ directly can override default attribute management, but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The class is straightforward, designed to store data in object attributes dynamically. The __init__ method assigns 'data' to self.__dict__, allowing for flexible attribute setting. The __str__ method outputs the class name and current attribute dictionary. There are no evident sources of untrusted input manipulation or malicious code; no network operations, environment variable usage, or code execution is present. The code appears to be a simple data container without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class for dynamic data storage, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is standard and does not contain malware or obfuscated code.",
