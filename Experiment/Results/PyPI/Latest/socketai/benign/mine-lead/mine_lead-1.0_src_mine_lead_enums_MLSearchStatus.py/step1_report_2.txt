{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class for representing different statuses of a machine learning search result.",
  "sources": "The Enum class and its members (none, found, error, not_found).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code solely defines an enum.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard in structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class from the enum module and defines a class MLSearchStatus with four status options as class attributes. These attributes are simple string values and do not include any user input handling, external data processing, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to serve as a static enumeration for status codes, which is common and benign in Python projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign enumeration definition used for tracking search statuses. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
