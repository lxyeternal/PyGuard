  "purpose": "Define a set of status constants for ML search results using an enumeration.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static enum members are defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static enum definitions with no dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional lowercase attribute names; no malicious or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Enum subclass with four string members representing different statuses. It contains no input/output, data processing, or external interactions. The attribute names are stylistically lowercase but not problematic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The code is static and self-contained, with no external data flows or dynamic execution. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign enumeration defining status constants. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The analysis and scores across reports are accurate and justified.",
