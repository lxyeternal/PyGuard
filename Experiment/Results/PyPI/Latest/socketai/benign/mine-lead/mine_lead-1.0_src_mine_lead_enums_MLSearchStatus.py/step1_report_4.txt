  "purpose": "Define an enumeration class for representing different statuses of a machine learning search result.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines a class with static enum members.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as there are no input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares an Enum class with four members indicating different statuses. All enum values are string literals, with no dynamic or external data involved. The code appears standard and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic, non-malicious definition of an Enum class for status representation. It contains no malicious intent or security risks.",
