  "purpose": "Define an enumeration class for ML search statuses to standardize status representation.",
  "sources": "Import statement for Enum class from the enum module, class declaration, and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard usage of enum for status codes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class and defines a class MLSearchStatus that inherits from Enum. The class contains four members representing different statuses, with values as strings. No input/output handling, data processing, or external interactions are present. The usage is straightforward, and there are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply defines an enumeration for status representation without any malicious behavior or security concerns.",
