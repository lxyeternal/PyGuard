  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for representing different statuses related to machine learning search results.",
  "sources": "The code imports the Enum class from the enum module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines a class with static members.",
  "anomalies": "The class uses lowercase attribute names, which is unconventional but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum subclass for representing status states. It includes four members: 'none' with an empty string, 'found', 'error', and 'not_found'. The Enum provides descriptive statuses for ML search outcomes. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows, and no unusual code or obfuscation. The use of lowercase attribute names is stylistic but not suspicious. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, harmless enumeration definition with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
