  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard API client with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The only issue is a minor bug in string comparison ('is' vs '=='), which does not impact security. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is zero. Fixing the bug would improve correctness but is not critical for security. The code is safe for use, with no malicious activity detected."
