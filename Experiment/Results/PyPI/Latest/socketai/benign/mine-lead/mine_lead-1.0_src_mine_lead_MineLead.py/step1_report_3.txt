{
  "purpose": "This code implements a client for interacting with the MineLead API to search for leads based on domain and name.",
  "sources": "Reads the api_key parameter during initialization, and the input parameters 'domain', 'name', and 'max_emails' in the search method. Uses requests.get and requests.post for API communication.",
  "sinks": "Sends API requests with the api_key and search parameters; response handling processes JSON responses. No untrusted data is directly written to files, system commands, or other sensitive areas.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (api_key, domain, name, max_emails) are incorporated into API request URLs and parameters. Responses are parsed and returned as response objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious or unusual code constructs; no obfuscated code; no hidden backdoors or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles API key input by checking for emptiness and raising exceptions. Uses standard request methods and proper error handling for JSON parsing issues. The request parameters are safely incorporated into API calls. No data leaks or insecure patterns are evident. No suspicious behaviors or malicious intent are observed. The code structure appears typical for an API client module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an API client for MineLead with proper input validation and error handling. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or suspicious activities are detected. The overall security risk is very low.",
