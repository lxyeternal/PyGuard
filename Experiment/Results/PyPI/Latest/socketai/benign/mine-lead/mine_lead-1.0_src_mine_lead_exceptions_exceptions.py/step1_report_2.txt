{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for machine learning-related errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points; exceptions are defined but not used to handle data or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as this code only defines classes without any execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed. The classes are straightforward subclass definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's base Exception class. There are no input sources, data handling, or outputs. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The purpose appears to be organizing exception handling for a machine learning application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard class definitions for custom exceptions with no malicious intent or security concerns. It serves a structural purpose within a larger application and does not pose any security risks.",
