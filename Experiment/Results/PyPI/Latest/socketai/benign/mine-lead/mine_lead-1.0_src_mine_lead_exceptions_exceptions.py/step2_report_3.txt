  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code only defines three custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. There are no external inputs, data processing, or outputs. The code is minimal and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious activity. They correctly identify that the code is purely structural, serving as custom exception classes for a larger application. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since the code is clear and straightforward.  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis that there's no malicious behavior.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports suggest any potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent that would warrant a higher risk score. The code is standard and safe.\n\n5. **Malware considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any malicious actions, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid speculative claims; they base their conclusions on the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, benign set of class definitions for exception handling, with no security risks or malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately assess the code as safe. No changes are necessary.",
