  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for machine learning-related errors",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources read in this code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as no input or processing occurs",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of the definition of three custom exception classes that inherit from Python's built-in Exception class. There are no external data sources, no processing logic, and no interactions with system resources or network. The structure is straightforward and conventional for defining custom exceptions. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are present. The code is minimal, clear, and intended for error handling purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign definition of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security issues.",
