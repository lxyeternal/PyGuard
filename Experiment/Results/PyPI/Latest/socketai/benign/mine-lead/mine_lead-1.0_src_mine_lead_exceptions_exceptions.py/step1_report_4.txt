  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for machine learning-related errors",
  "sources": "None; no data input or external data reading in the code",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or external data writing in the code",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow present",
  "anomalies": "Simple class definitions inheriting from built-in Exception; no anomalies or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three class definitions that create custom exceptions by inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. There are no data inputs, external data sources, or sinks, nor any dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The classes serve as custom error types likely used elsewhere in a larger application. No security issues or malicious intent are apparent in these definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward and benign set of custom exception class definitions with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
