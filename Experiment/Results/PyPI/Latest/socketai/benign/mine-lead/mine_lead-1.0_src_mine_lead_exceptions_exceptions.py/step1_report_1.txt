{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for machine learning related errors.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leak or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual patterns; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares three custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. These are used for categorizing errors related to machine learning operations. No external input, data processing, or network communication occurs. The classes are standard and simple, with no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. The structure is typical for custom exception handling in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only standard class definitions for exception handling and shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe, with no anomalies or malicious activity.",
