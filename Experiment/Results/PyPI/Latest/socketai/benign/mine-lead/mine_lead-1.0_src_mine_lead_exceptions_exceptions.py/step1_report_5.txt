{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for machine learning-related error handling",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code solely defines classes",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code only declares classes",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; straightforward class inheritance",
  "analysis": "The code creates a hierarchy of custom exception classes, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. There are no input sources, data processing, or output sinks. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The purpose appears to be structuring exception handling in a machine learning application context, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security issues.",
