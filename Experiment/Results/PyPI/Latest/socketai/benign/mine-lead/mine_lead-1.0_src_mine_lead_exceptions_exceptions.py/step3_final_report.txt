  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a machine learning application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, network calls, or external data handling present",
  "flows": "None; the code only declares classes without data flow or execution logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class inheritance with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three custom exception class definitions inheriting from Exception. It contains no external inputs, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The structure is simple, clear, and typical for error handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk of 0, with high confidence. The code's purpose is purely organizational within a larger system, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are accurate and justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
