  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims made, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**\n   - The original code defines three custom exception classes: `MLException`, `MLApiException`, and `MLClientException`.\n   - These classes inherit directly from Python's built-in `Exception` class.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Logical and Security Analysis:**\n   - The code is straightforward, serving as a structural component for error handling.\n   - No evidence of malicious activity, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n   - The purpose is purely organizational within a larger application context.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - **Malware score:** 0\n     - **Obfuscated score:** 0\n     - **Security risk:** 0\n     - **Confidence:** 1 (or 1.0 in some reports)\n   \n   These scores are consistent with the code's nature and the detailed reasoning provided.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent based on assumptions; all conclusions are supported by the code's simplicity.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - Given the simplicity and the absence of any suspicious patterns, I agree with the reports' conclusions.\n   - The scores are appropriate and justified.\n   - The code is safe, with no security risks or malware indications.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at **0**.\n- The confidence scores are justified at **1**.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are accurate and consistent with the analysis.",
