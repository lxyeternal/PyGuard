  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception:\n- MLException\n- MLApiException\n- MLClientException\n\n**Review of the reports:**\nAll five reports uniformly state that:\n- The code is straightforward class inheritance for custom exceptions.\n- There are no external data sources, sinks, or data flows.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The purpose is to organize error handling in a machine learning context.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), and all report zero malware, obfuscation, and security risks.\n\n**Confirmations and Logical Consistency:**\n- The code matches the descriptions: no anomalies, no signs of malicious activity.\n- The reports are consistent with each other and accurately describe the benign nature of the code.\n- No errors or flaws are apparent in the reasoning or conclusions.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n- Malware score: All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score: Correctly 0, as the code is simple class definitions.\n- Security risk: Appropriately 0, given the lack of external data handling or security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- The reports assume the code is only class definitions without usage. If this code were embedded in a larger context, potential misuse might be possible, but based solely on this snippet, the assessments are sound.\n- No need to adjust scores; they are appropriate.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are justified and reasonable.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk present)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action or concern is necessary.",
