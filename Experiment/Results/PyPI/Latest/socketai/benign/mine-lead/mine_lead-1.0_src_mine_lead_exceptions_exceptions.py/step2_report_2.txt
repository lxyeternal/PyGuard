  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code is a straightforward set of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - All reports agree that there are no data sources, sinks, or flows, and no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code is minimal, clear, and typical for defining custom exceptions.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and contains no security issues.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n   - The consistent conclusion across reports supports the assessment that the code is safe.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary unless new context suggests otherwise.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The `malware` score is 0 across all reports, indicating no malicious activity.\n   - `securityRisk` is also 0, reflecting no vulnerabilities or security concerns.\n   - The code is purely structural, with no external interactions or dynamic behavior.\n   - Therefore, higher risk scores are unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code shows no signs of malicious intent—no obfuscation, no malicious code, no suspicious patterns.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Challenging Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's actual content.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all indicate no issues.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a simple, standard definition of custom exception classes.\n- No data flows, external inputs, or outputs.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- The code's purpose is purely structural, with no security implications.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's benign nature. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe and standard.\n- All scores correctly reflect the absence of malicious activity or security risks.\n- The overall security posture of this code is negligible.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores; no further action needed.",
