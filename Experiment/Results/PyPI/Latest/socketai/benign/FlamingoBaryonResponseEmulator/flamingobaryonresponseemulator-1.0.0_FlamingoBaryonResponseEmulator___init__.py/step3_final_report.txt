{
  "purpose": "The code imports a version string from a local module and a class from an external package, likely for initialization or setup purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from a local module (__version__) and an external package (flamingo_response_emulator).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that process untrusted data; the code only performs static imports.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths; the code does not process data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing. The external package name is domain-specific but not inherently suspicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2). Confidence levels are high, reflecting the simplicity of the code. The trustworthiness of the external package cannot be assessed from this snippet but does not impact the benign assessment here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the minimal import pattern. The overall security posture is very low risk, assuming the external package is trustworthy.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
