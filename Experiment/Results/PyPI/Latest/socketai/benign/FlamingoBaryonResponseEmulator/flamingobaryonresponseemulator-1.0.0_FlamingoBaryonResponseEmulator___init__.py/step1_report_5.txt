  "purpose": "Importing version information and a response emulator class for use within the module",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local __version__ module, import of FlamingoBaryonResponseEmulator from an external package",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present in this code fragment",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are only imports and no data flow or execution logic",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports: one from a local version module and one from a third-party package named flamingo_response_emulator. There are no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The imported components are standard for modular code organization, assuming the package flamingo_response_emulator is legitimate and intended.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import pattern with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks evident in this fragment.",
