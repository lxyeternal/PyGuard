  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable for Python package versioning.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; simple assignment of a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard declaration of a version string. No inputs, outputs, or data flows are present. The code is not obfuscated, malicious, or security-sensitive. All reports correctly identify the simplicity and benign nature of this snippet. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
