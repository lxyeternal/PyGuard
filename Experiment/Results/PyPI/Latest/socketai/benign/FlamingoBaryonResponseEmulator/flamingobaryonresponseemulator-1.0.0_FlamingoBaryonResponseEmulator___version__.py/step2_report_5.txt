  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Code presence and functionality**: All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable. There are no input sources, data processing, or output sinks. The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for Python package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes**: No logical errors or mistakes are identified. The reports uniformly recognize that the code does not contain any anomalies, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues**:\n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1, malware of 0, obfuscated of 0, and security risk of 0.\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's nature. Since the code is trivial and standard, these scores seem appropriate.\n\n4. **Risk scores justification**:\n   - The security risk score is 0 across all reports, which is justified given the code's simplicity and lack of any malicious or suspicious activity.\n   - Malware score is 0, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Obfuscated is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n5. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions**:\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They recognize that assigning a version string is a common and benign practice.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are evident.\n\n**Overall assessment**:\n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nAll reports are accurate. The code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns. The scores reflect this appropriately.",
