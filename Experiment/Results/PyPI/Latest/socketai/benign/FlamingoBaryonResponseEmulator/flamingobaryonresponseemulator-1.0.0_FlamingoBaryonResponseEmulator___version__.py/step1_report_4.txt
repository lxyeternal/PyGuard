  "flows": "No data flows are present as the code only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal; only a version string assignment with no additional code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to a variable __version__, a common practice in Python packages for versioning. No input reading, no data processing, and no suspicious behavior or complex logic are present. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version declaration typical in Python modules. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
