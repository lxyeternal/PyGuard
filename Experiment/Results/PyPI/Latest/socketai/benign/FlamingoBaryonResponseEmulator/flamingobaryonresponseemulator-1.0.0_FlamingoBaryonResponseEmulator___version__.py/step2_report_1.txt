  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n**Overall Observation:**\nAll reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or suspicious behaviors. The code is minimal, standard practice for Python package versioning, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's content:\nThe original code:\n```python\n__version__ = \"1.0.0\"\n```\nmatches the description across all reports. No additional code, data handling, or logic is present.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- All reports correctly identify that this is a benign, minimal version declaration.\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning; the assessments are consistent and accurate.\n\n### Scores and their appropriateness:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports. Correct, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 in all reports. Correct, since there's no evidence of security issues.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports assume that the code is only the line `__version__ = \"1.0.0\"`. Given the context, this is accurate.\n- No false positives or assumptions about malicious intent are made.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the uniformity and correctness of the reports, I concur with their conclusions.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that in real scenarios, if the code is part of a larger file, one should review the entire context. But based solely on the provided snippet and reports, there are no issues.",
