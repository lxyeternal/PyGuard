  "conclusion": "Based on the collective assessments, the dependency appears benign with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are appropriate given the evidence. The malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0, and the overall security risk can be conservatively set at 0.2 to account for minimal residual uncertainty due to limited code context."
