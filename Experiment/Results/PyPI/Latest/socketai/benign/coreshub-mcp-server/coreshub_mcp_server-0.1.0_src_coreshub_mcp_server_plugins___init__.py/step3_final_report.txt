  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security and malicious potential of the open source dependency based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "No specific code provided; assessments are based on report summaries indicating standard, benign behavior.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable; no untrusted data sources or sinks identified in summaries.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no code flow analysis possible without actual code snippets.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns reported; reports consistently note absence of obfuscation, malicious activity, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "All five reports uniformly describe the code as straightforward, benign, and free of obfuscation or malicious indicators. Confidence levels vary from moderate (0.6) to high (0.9), justified by the lack of code snippets and limited context. Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of suspicious activity. Obfuscation scores are zero, matching the reports' claims. Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk. The reasoning across reports is consistent and justified, with no evidence suggesting malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the collective assessments, the dependency appears benign with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are appropriate given the evidence. The malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0, and the overall security risk can be conservatively set at 0.2 to account for minimal residual uncertainty due to limited code context.",
