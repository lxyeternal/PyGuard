  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code constructs API requests with signature signing, which suggests proper authentication.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are visible; sensitive info is sourced from 'settings'.\n- No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The responses are processed and formatted for display, typical for monitoring tools.\n- No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n- The use of get_signature() indicates standard request signing, assuming its implementation is secure.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Standard API interaction for inference services.\n- **Anomalies:** None; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Safe, purpose-driven, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 (low).\n\n**Assessment:** The scoring aligns with the analysis. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Similar API client with request signing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or secrets.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Legitimate, standard API client code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** API interaction with configuration from 'settings'.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Typical API client, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Fetching data from external API, displaying responses.\n- **Anomalies:** Responses may contain sensitive info, but this is expected.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious activity; safe data retrieval.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Standard API request and response handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Typical, safe API client code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly lower risk score, which is reasonable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0.2, with one at 0.1, reflecting low security risk.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the provided analysis.\n- No evidence of malicious intent or security issues.\n- The only potential concern is the handling of sensitive data in responses, but this aligns with the tool's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low risk, primarily due to external API interactions and handling of sensitive data)\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are appropriate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client for inference services with no malicious or obfuscated features. The low risk scores are justified, and the malware scores are correctly set to zero.",
