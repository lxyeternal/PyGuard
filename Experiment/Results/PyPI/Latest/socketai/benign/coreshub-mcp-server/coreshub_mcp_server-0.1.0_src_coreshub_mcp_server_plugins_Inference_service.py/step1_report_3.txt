  "purpose": "This code provides tools for retrieving inference service details and logs from a remote API, primarily for internal management and monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from settings (settings.user_id, settings.access_key, settings.secret_key, settings.base_url), user input parameters for API calls (zone, owner, key_words, page, size, start_time, end_time, service_id, reverse).",
  "sinks": "Uses get_signature to sign requests with access keys, constructs full URLs for requests, and sends HTTP GET requests to external API endpoints.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> parameters -> get_signature signing -> URL construction -> requests.get() call -> response handling and JSON parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; the get_signature function usage suggests proper signing; no suspicious dynamic code or obfuscation detected; the code appears to handle parameters securely. Default time values are generated via get_formatted_time, no hardcoded timestamps.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes for interacting with remote inference services and their logs, using proper request signing and parameter handling. It retrieves configuration from a settings module, which likely contains credentials. The functions perform network requests with error handling, formatting the output for display. No indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The request signing process and usage of external URLs are standard for API integrations. No suspicious code flows or obfuscated code are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client implementation for fetching inference services and logs, with appropriate signing and parameter handling. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code.",
