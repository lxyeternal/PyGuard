{
  "purpose": "This code provides tools for querying inference services and logs from a remote API, including signature signing for authenticated requests.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters such as 'zone', 'owner', 'service_id', 'start_time', 'end_time', 'key_words', 'page', 'size', 'reverse'. These are used to construct API request parameters.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external API endpoints, specifically 'requests.get(full_url)'. The signed URL incorporates potentially untrusted input but is handled via 'get_signature' to sign requests securely.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> parameter assembly -> signing with 'get_signature' -> URL construction -> HTTP GET request to external API -> response handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs signature signing for API requests, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials are present, but reliance on 'settings' for keys could be sensitive if compromised. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely constructs API requests with signature signing, retrieves data, and handles exceptions gracefully. No signs of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications. External requests are made to a presumably trusted API, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code features are present. It appears to be standard API client code with proper parameter handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, designed to interact with a remote inference service API. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or malicious data handling. It performs authenticated API requests and handles responses appropriately.",
