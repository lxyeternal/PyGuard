  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes tools for retrieving inference services and logs via API, with parameters from function arguments and settings.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Constructs signed URLs, makes GET requests, formats responses.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious code. The signature process appears standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate API client code, safe, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing secure request signing, no suspicious code.\n- No signs of backdoors or malicious activity.\n- Scores: Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 are consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focus on configuration, signing, and network requests.\n- No malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- Scores: Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 fit.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Highlights response handling, potential data leakage via responses, but no malicious intent.\n- No backdoors or code injection.\n- Scores: Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar pattern: standard API interaction, proper signing, no suspicious code.\n- Scores: Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1 are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence & Functionality:** All reports confirm the code is a standard API client for inference services, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- **Potential Risks:** The only concern could be the handling of API responses containing sensitive data, but that aligns with the purpose of such tools and does not constitute malicious activity.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports consistently indicate malware and obfuscation scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risks:** Slightly varying but low scores (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risks given the code's purpose and structure.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, primarily due to handling of potentially sensitive data in responses, but not a security threat.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the current assessments.** The code appears legitimate, purpose-driven, and secure based on the provided snippets and reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no signs of malware or obfuscation, and minimal security risk.",
