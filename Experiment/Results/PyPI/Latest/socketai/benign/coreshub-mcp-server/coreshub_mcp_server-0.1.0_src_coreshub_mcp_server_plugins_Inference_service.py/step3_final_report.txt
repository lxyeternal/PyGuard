  "purpose": "Tools for retrieving inference services and logs via API, with parameters for zone, owner, keywords, page, and size, using request signing for authentication.",
  "sources": "Arguments passed to execute_tool methods, settings for configuration, get_signature function for signing requests.",
  "sinks": "Constructed full URL with signed query, GET requests to remote API, JSON response parsing.",
  "flows": "Arguments -> parameters -> get_signature -> signed URL -> requests.get -> response -> JSON parsing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns, standard request signing.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs API requests with proper signing, handles responses safely, and includes error handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The response formatting could expose sensitive data but aligns with the tool's purpose. External dependencies like get_signature() are assumed secure. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-driven API client for inference services with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified given the external signing and configuration reliance. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its intended use.",
