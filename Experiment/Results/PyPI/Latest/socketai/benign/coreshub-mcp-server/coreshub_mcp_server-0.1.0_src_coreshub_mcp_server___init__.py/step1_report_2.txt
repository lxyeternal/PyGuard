{
  "purpose": "The script initializes and manages a lightweight, extensible MCP server framework, including plugin discovery, environment setup, logging, and server startup.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments (e.g., --debug, --list-plugins, --log-file), environment variables imported from settings, and plugin files within the plugins directory.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve importing modules dynamically, printing plugin info, and starting the server asynchronously. No direct data leaks or malicious commands are evident.",
  "flows": "Sources such as command-line args and environment variables flow into setup functions; plugin modules are imported based on filesystem discovery; server is initiated via asyncio, and plugin info is printed if requested.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; dynamic imports are standard for plugin systems. The environment validation is straightforward. The code structure is typical for server apps. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks for a plugin-based server application. It dynamically discovers and imports plugins, validates environment variables, configures logging, and starts an asyncio server. There are no indicators of malicious behavior such as network data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden malicious code. The only dynamic operation involves importlib.import_module for plugins and asyncio.run for server start, both standard patterns. Environment validation appears routine. No hardcoded secrets or credential theft mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate server setup and plugin management tool with no malicious or suspicious features. It adheres to standard practices for extensible Python server frameworks. No evidence of malware or malicious code found.",
