{
  "purpose": "This script initializes and runs the CoreshubMCP server, including plugin discovery, environment validation, and server startup.",
  "sources": "Environment variables in init_environment(), command-line arguments in main(), plugin files in plugins directory, import statements for modules and plugins.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs, import calls, sys.exit() for error handling, and asyncio.run(serve()) which starts server operations.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and command-line args influence logging and plugin loading; plugin discovery loads modules; server is started via asyncio.run(serve()).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are evident. No use of insecure practices or obfuscated code. Plugin import relies on filesystem discovery, which is standard. The environment validation relies on external settings but appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs server setup tasks: logging configuration, plugin discovery via importlib, environment validation through external settings, and server startup. All actions seem typical for a server application. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity is present. The environment validation is passive and relies on external settings, which is standard. The plugin loading uses dynamic import based on filesystem scanning, which is common for plugin architectures. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is detected. The code structure and flow are clear and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard server setup with plugin loading and environment validation. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and primarily designed for server initialization and plugin management.",
