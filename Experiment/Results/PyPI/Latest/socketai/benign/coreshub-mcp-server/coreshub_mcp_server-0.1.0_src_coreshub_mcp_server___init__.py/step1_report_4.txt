  "purpose": "The script initializes and runs a lightweight server framework, discovers and loads plugins, and verifies environment variables for the CoreshubMCP server.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments; environment variables; plugin files in the 'plugins' directory",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs; plugin modules imported dynamically",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> setup_logging and discover_plugins functions; environment variable checks -> main execution flow; plugin discovery -> importlib.import_module; server startup via asyncio.run",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; dynamic plugin import via importlib is standard, but could be misused if plugins are malicious; environment variables are checked but values are not shown; commented-out environment validation function is present but not active",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard server setup tasks, including logging configuration, plugin discovery, environment validation, and server startup. It uses importlib for dynamic plugin loading, which is common in plugin-based systems. Environment variables are validated, though the actual environment setup is not shown here. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, command execution, or network connections outside the standard server functions. The commented-out environment check suggests awareness of environment validation, but it is not active. No obfuscated code or malicious backdoors are evident. Overall, the code appears to be a typical server framework with plugin support, without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard server framework with plugin discovery and environment validation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are detected. The dynamic import of plugins is typical for extensible systems. Overall security risks are low, with no suspicious activity found.",
