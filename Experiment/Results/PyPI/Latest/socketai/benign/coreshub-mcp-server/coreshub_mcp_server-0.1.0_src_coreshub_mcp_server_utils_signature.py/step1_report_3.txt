{
  "purpose": "The code generates a cryptographic signature for API requests, likely for authentication or integrity verification purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as method, url, ak, sk, and params; data encoded within functions",
  "sinks": "URL parameters (url_param), signature in URL query string",
  "flows": "Inputs (method, url, ak, sk, params) → processing (sorting, encoding, hashing, HMAC signing) → output URL with signature",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external network activity, no obfuscated code or hidden backdoors. Use of standard libraries and cryptographic functions appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic signing for API request authentication. It encodes data, sorts parameters, creates a string to sign, computes an HMAC SHA-256 digest, encodes it in base64, and appends it as a URL parameter. All cryptographic operations use standard libraries without unusual or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side effects. The code appears to implement a typical signature generation process for API security, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for generating API request signatures using HMAC SHA-256. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The only concern is ensuring secure storage and handling of secrets (sk), which is outside the scope of this code.",
