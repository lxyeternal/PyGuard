  "purpose": "Generate a signed URL with HMAC SHA256 signature for API request authentication.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters, URL string, method, access key (ak), secret key (sk).",
  "sinks": "HMAC digest, base64-encoded signature, URL parameters including the signature.",
  "flows": "Parameters are sorted and included in the string to sign; HMAC is computed using the secret key; signature is URL-encoded and appended to the URL parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors. The code follows standard signature generation procedures. No malicious code or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a typical HMAC SHA256 signing process for API authentication. It properly encodes parameters, sorts them, constructs the string to sign, and computes the signature securely. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or malicious data handling observed. The code appears to be intended for secure request signing, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of API request signing. It does not contain malicious behavior or backdoors. No security risks are identified based on this code segment.",
