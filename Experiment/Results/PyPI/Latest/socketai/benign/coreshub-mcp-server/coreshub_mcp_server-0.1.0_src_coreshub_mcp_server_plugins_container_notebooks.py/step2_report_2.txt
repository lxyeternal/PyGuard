  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** All reports agree that the code implements tools for retrieving container and SSH info via signed API requests, using environment settings and user-provided arguments.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** All mention that the code makes HTTP GET requests with signed URLs, processes responses into JSON or text, and does not perform dangerous operations beyond data retrieval.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** None detect hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious external domains. The use of signature functions and environment variables aligns with standard secure API client practices.\n\n- **Conclusions & Confidence:** All confidently state that the code appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- **Functionality & Logic:** The code is straightforward, with no evident bugs or logical flaws. It correctly constructs signed URLs, handles responses, and formats output.\n\n- **Security & Malicious Indicators:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious external calls, no backdoors, no data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.\n\n- **Error Handling:** Minimal but typical; exceptions are caught and reported without leaking sensitive info.\n\n### Scoring evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, readable code.\n\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0.2, indicating low but non-zero risk, possibly due to external API interactions and signature handling, which are standard but still introduce some surface area.\n\n### Critical observations:\n\n- The **scores are consistent** across reports and seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n- **No claims are based on assumptions**; all analyses correctly identify the code as standard API client logic.\n\n- **No evidence of malicious intent** or security flaws.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of API tools for container and SSH info retrieval.\n\n- **Malware risk:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** Should remain at 0.\n\n- **Security risk:** Given the use of signature-based authentication, environment variables, and no suspicious patterns, a risk score of 0.2 seems acceptable but could be slightly lowered to 0.1 for increased confidence.\n\n---\n\n### **My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** (to reflect minimal residual risk from external API interactions, but overall very low)\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior.**",
