{
  "purpose": "The code defines tools for querying container and SSH information from a remote server, primarily for managing and retrieving container instance data and access details.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration settings (`settings.user_id`, `settings.access_key`, `settings.secret_key`, `settings.base_url`), input arguments (`arguments` dictionary), and performs HTTP GET requests to external APIs.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external APIs using dynamically constructed URLs with signature parameters; JSON parsing of API responses.",
  "flows": "Sources of input (configurations and arguments) -> signature generation and URL construction -> external API requests -> response handling and JSON serialization.",
  "anomalies": "The code constructs URLs with signatures based on parameters; no evident hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code, malicious system calls, or hidden backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API requests for container data and SSH info, using proper signature functions and response handling. It does not contain suspicious or malicious logic such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoor behavior. No hardcoded credentials are visible; all sensitive info appears to be retrieved from configuration settings. The functions include error handling and use proper signing methods. No unusual or malicious behaviors are detected. The code follows typical patterns for API integration and data retrieval, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation for managing container and SSH information via API calls. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. No suspicious or malicious signals are present.",
