  "purpose": "Tools for retrieving container and SSH information via signed API requests, utilizing environment settings and user parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters from function arguments and environment variables; external API endpoints for container and SSH info.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests to external services, response data processed into JSON or text, no data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → URL construction and signing → HTTP request → response handling and formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, suspicious URL patterns, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs signed API requests using get_signature, retrieves data from external endpoints, and formats responses. It handles errors gracefully and does not perform any malicious actions. No suspicious external domains or obfuscation are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with standard API client practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation for container and SSH info retrieval. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, and the code is safe for use.",
