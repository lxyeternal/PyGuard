  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements two tools: `GetContainerInfoTool` and `GetSSHInfoTool`.\n- Both generate signed API requests using `get_signature`.\n- They retrieve container and SSH info from external endpoints, with parameters from function arguments and environment settings.\n- Response data is formatted into `TextContent`.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- Error handling is minimal but standard.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or suspicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as API client tools.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; requests are signed and responses processed.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious behavior, aligns with our understanding.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the tools.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, legitimate API interaction.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same observations as above; consistent and reasonable.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to previous; consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also aligns with previous analyses.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Judgment\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and there's no evidence of malicious activity—no data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.2) in most reports, justified by the fact that these tools interact with external APIs and handle sensitive operations (signing requests, managing container info). The low score reflects minimal risk, given no malicious intent or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Particularly notable:**\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- Proper use of signature functions.\n- No suspicious external domains or obfuscated code.\n- Error handling is generic but standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and align with the code's nature.\n- The malware score should remain at **0**, as there's no indication of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at **0**.\n- The security risk score can be slightly increased if desired, but 0.2 is acceptable given the external API interactions, which are typical in such tools.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n| Score Type     | Suggested Value | Justification                                               |\n|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | **0**             | No malicious activity detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated     | **0**             | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.            |\n| Risk           | **0.2**           | Slight external API interaction risk, but standard practice.|\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears legitimate, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The existing risk score is appropriate, and the malware/obfuscated scores should remain at zero.",
