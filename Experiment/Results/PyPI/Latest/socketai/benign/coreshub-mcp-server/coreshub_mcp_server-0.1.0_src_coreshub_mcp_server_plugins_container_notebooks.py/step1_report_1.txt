{
  "purpose": "This code defines tools for retrieving container and SSH information from a server, primarily via signed HTTP requests to a specified API.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function arguments, environment variables (`settings`), and constants within the code. Key inputs are 'zone', 'name', 'uuid', 'owner', 'user_id', and 'services'.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests to external URLs formed with signature-based query parameters. Responses are processed and formatted into text contents.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are used to generate API request URLs with signatures. These URLs are fetched via requests.get, and responses are parsed for display. No data is written or transmitted beyond these requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious URLs detected. The code uses standard signature functions and makes straightforward API requests. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of API client tools for container management, using signature-based authentication. It reads parameters from function arguments and environment settings, constructs signed URLs, and fetches data from remote services. Error handling is minimal but typical. No malicious or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware indicators are present. The request signatures, environment variable usage, and response handling align with common API client patterns. Overall, it looks like legitimate infrastructure code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward API client implementation for container and SSH info retrieval. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided source. It operates as expected for its purpose, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
