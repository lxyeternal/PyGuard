  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward API client for container and SSH info retrieval.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious URL patterns are identified.\n- The code relies on environment variables (`settings`) and standard signature functions (`get_signature`) for request signing.\n- Responses are processed into formatted JSON or text content.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware are evident.\n- Error handling is minimal but typical.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n**1. Are the reported issues present in the code?**\n- No, the reports do not identify any issues or vulnerabilities that are actually present. The code appears clean and standard.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they do not overstate risks or misinterpret the code's purpose.\n- They correctly identify the absence of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0.2 or 0\n- These seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n**4. Justification for higher risk scores (>0.5):**\n- No evidence suggests any higher risk. The code is a typical API client with proper signing, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behaviors.\n- Therefore, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they interpret the code as legitimate.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report content:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: all are low risk, no malware, no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, standard, and unobfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — minimal risk, primarily due to external API interactions, which are standard in such contexts.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a typical, well-structured API client for container management.\n- No indicators of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or malicious payloads.\n- The only potential concern could be the exposure of environment variables or secrets, but they are handled via `settings`, which is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my judgment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0            | No malicious code or payloads present.                       |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.           |\n| Security Risk    | 0.2          | Slight risk due to external API calls, but standard practice. |\n\n**Overall, the code is safe and legitimate.**",
