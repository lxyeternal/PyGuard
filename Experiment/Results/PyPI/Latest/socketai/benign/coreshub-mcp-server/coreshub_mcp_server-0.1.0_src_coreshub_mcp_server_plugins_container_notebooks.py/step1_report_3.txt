{
  "purpose": "The code defines tools for retrieving container and SSH information from a server, including signing requests and handling responses.",
  "sources": "User input from 'arguments' dictionaries, settings for user_id, access_key, secret_key, and API request parameters.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests made via requests.get(), response parsing, and JSON handling for data display.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from arguments to request parameters, then to HTTP GET requests, with responses processed and formatted into text outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets beyond 'settings' variables; no suspicious or obfuscated code; standard request signing is used. No evident backdoors or malicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs signed HTTP GET requests to fetch container and SSH info, relying on external 'settings' and 'get_signature'. It formats server responses for display. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious payloads. The request signing approach suggests an intent to secure API calls, not malicious activity. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic detected. The code appears to implement legitimate data retrieval functions within a cloud or container management context.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs authorized API requests to fetch container and SSH info, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It follows standard practices for request signing and response handling. No malicious intent detected.",
