  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Behavior:**\n   - The code implements tools for retrieving container and SSH information via signed HTTP GET requests.\n   - It constructs URLs dynamically based on input arguments and environment settings.\n   - Uses a signature function (`get_signature`) to authenticate requests.\n   - Handles responses and formats data into `TextContent`.\n   - No hardcoded secrets or credentials beyond environment variables.\n   - No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious URL patterns.\n   - Error handling is minimal but standard.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Malware:**\n   - The code performs legitimate API calls with signature-based authentication.\n   - No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n   - No suspicious or obfuscated code segments.\n   - External interactions are standard for cloud/container management.\n\n3. **Assessment of Scores:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0.2 (low, likely due to external API interactions)\n   - These seem reasonable given the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Concerns:**\n   - The only minor concern could be reliance on environment variables and external API endpoints, but this is typical for such tools.\n   - Error handling could be more detailed, but this doesn't impact security.\n   - No evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Conclusion & Final Estimation:**\n   - Based on the detailed analysis, the code is a standard, legitimate implementation for container and SSH info retrieval.\n   - No malicious activity or malware is evident.\n   - The scores assigned by reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to external API interactions, which are standard and controlled)\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The reports are consistent and justified.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The code appears safe and intended for legitimate infrastructure management.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for container and SSH info retrieval, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate.",
