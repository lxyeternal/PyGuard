  "purpose": "Provides tools to retrieve container instance and SSH information via API calls, with signature-based authentication.",
  "sources": "User input parameters for 'zone', 'name', 'namespace', 'uuid', 'owner', 'user_id', 'services', and environment variables like settings.user_id, settings.access_key, settings.secret_key, settings.base_url.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external API endpoints constructed with signed URLs, JSON responses parsed into text outputs.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> Parameter assembly -> Signature generation -> URL construction -> HTTP GET request -> JSON response parsing -> TextContent output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; dynamic URL signing; no obfuscated code; no suspicious external domains; standard request handling; no unusual code patterns or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two tools for retrieving container and SSH info through signed API requests. It uses environment settings for credentials and URL base, constructs signatures for secure API calls, and processes responses into text outputs. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no hidden behaviors are present. All API interactions seem intended for legitimate data retrieval. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of tools for container and SSH information retrieval via signed API requests. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided code. The structure is standard, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
