  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly describes API client functions with input parameters, environment variables, and response handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard API request pattern with proper signing; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Justification:** The low security risk score (0.2) seems appropriate given the code's purpose and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing legitimate API interaction with signed requests.\n- No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, and standard error handling.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- Justification: Consistent with a benign API client; no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on standard data retrieval with proper request signing.\n- No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- Justification: No reason to suspect malicious intent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar pattern: API request with signature, response parsing, no suspicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- Justification: Consistent with previous assessments.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Reiterates standard API request patterns, environment variable usage, and response handling.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n- Justification: No security risks or malware indicated.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious behavior. The code is a straightforward API client with request signing, typical in cloud management tools.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or suspicious patterns, a low risk score (~0.2) is justified. The minimal risk accounts for potential misconfigurations or external API issues, but not malicious intent.\n\n### My Final Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** (standard API client with minimal inherent risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for container and SSH info retrieval, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks based on the provided source and reports.",
