{
  "purpose": "This code provides a plugin management framework with registration, retrieval, and abstract execution methods for tools and prompts, aimed at extensibility and modularity.",
  "sources": "Class variables and methods for registration and retrieval of tool and prompt classes; abstract methods intended for subclass implementation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external inputs, or network interactions are present; abstract methods are placeholders for subclass logic.",
  "flows": "Registration methods add classes to internal dictionaries; execution methods are abstract and meant to be overridden; no data flows from untrusted sources in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads; code is straightforward and structural.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a plugin architecture with class registration, abstract base classes, and utility functions. It does not perform dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle untrusted data. The registration mechanisms are standard, and the abstract methods serve as placeholders for subclass logic. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The code's design is typical for plugin systems, and the absence of external data handling or network calls indicates a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured plugin framework with no malicious or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, low security risk 0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. It relies on subclasses to implement specific logic, but the base code itself is safe.",
