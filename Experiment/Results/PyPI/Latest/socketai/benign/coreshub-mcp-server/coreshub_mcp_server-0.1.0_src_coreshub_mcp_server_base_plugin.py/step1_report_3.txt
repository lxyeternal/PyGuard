{
  "purpose": "Defines a registry system for tools and prompts, along with abstract base classes for tools and prompts, facilitating their registration and execution.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (datetime, abc, typing), and external module 'mcp' and 'mcp.types'. No direct data input handling observed.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially dangerous actions. The code mainly manages class registration and time formatting.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; code mainly deals with class management and time calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code uses straightforward class methods and data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a class registry for tools and prompts, with methods for registration and retrieval. It provides utility functions like time formatting and abstract methods for executing tools and prompts. All operations are standard for such a system; no dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks are present. The use of external modules 'mcp' and 'mcp.types' is not suspicious, assuming they are legitimate. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard framework for managing tools and prompts with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It contains no malware or suspicious behavior. The design is typical for plugin-like systems, with no signs of sabotage or security threats.",
