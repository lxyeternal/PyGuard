  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a plugin-like framework with class registration, abstract base classes, utility functions, and no evident malicious activity.\n- They highlight the absence of dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted external data.\n- The code appears to be a standard, well-structured modular system for managing tools and prompts.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is syntactically correct, and the described functionality aligns with standard patterns for such systems.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No handling of untrusted data, no external network calls, no secrets, or insecure practices are observed.\n- **Risks:** The only potential concern is the placeholder nature of execution methods, but this is typical for base classes.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The registration system is straightforward and safe.\n- The time formatting utility is secure and standard.\n- No assumptions or suspicious claims are made about the code.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** All reports give a low risk (~0.1–0.2). This is reasonable because the code is a framework, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- The reports are consistent and justified in their assessments.\n- The only point to emphasize is that the execution methods are placeholders, but this is expected for abstract base classes.\n- No report suggests any assumptions that could be challenged; all findings are aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\nBased on all reports, the code appears to be a **benign, standard plugin management framework** with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to the nature of plugin registration, but inherently low risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is safe, well-structured, and appropriate for its purpose. No changes to the reported scores are necessary. The assessments are consistent, justified, and align with the code's behavior.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Accept the current scores; no further action needed.",
