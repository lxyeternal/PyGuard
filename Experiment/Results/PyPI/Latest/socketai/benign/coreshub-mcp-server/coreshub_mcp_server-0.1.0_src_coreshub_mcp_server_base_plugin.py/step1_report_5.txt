  "purpose": "Define a plugin-like framework for managing tools and prompts, including registration, retrieval, and execution mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Import statements (datetime, abc, typing, mcp), class attributes, static and class methods, and abstract method definitions.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution points such as execute_tool and execute_prompt methods which may run arbitrary code or handle untrusted input, but no actual untrusted data sources or sinks are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Initialization of classes and registration processes are straightforward; no data flows from untrusted sources; execution methods are placeholders for user-defined implementations, which are not provided here.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, such as dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, or hardcoded secrets. The code uses standard patterns for plugin management and time formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two abstract base classes for tools and prompts, with registration via a class registry. Methods are standard, with no evidence of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious behaviors. The functions serve typical roles in plugin architectures, and no untrusted data handling or network activity is visible. All methods are straightforward and do not perform any malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign framework for managing tools and prompts, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It provides structured registration and retrieval mechanisms, with safe placeholder methods for subclasses to implement specific logic. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
