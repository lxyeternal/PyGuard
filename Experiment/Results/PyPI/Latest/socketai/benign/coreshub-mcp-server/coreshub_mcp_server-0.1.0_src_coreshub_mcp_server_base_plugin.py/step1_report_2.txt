{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract base classes and a registry system for managing tools and prompts in a modular framework.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (datetime, abc, typing, mcp), class attributes, class methods, static methods, and abstract methods.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or stored in a way that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Class registration methods register classes into internal dictionaries; static and class methods return data or perform time calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and follows standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a registry for tools and prompts, with mechanisms for registration and retrieval. It uses class variables for metadata, provides time formatting utilities, and enforces implementation of key methods via abstract classes. No external data inputs are processed, and no suspicious behavior or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured framework for managing tools and prompts with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily facilitates modular extension and retrieval of classes and time calculations.",
