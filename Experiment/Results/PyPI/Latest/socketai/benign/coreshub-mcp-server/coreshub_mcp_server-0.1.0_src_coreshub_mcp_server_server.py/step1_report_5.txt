{
  "purpose": "This code sets up an asynchronous MCP server that provides tool and prompt listing, retrieval, and execution functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reads data from function arguments (e.g., 'name' and 'arguments' parameters in RPC functions), uses imported modules, and reads streams from stdio_server.",
  "sinks": "Returns data such as tool descriptions, prompt definitions, or execution results. Uses asynchronous functions to handle server requests, potentially receiving untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (name, arguments) flow from external RPC calls into functions like get_prompt, call_tool, and list_prompts; data flows to tool executions or prompt evaluations; responses flow back as JSON objects or text content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. Use of standard library and known modules with no unusual behavior. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an asynchronous server that manages tools and prompts via a registry. It retrieves classes and executes methods accordingly, with proper validation for known tool and prompt names. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data theft, network communication beyond standard streams, or backdoors. The logic appears typical for a plugin server. No suspicious code, obfuscated sections, or unsafe patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of an MCP server with plugin management capabilities. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code segment.",
