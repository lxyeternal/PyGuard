  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a server setup that manages tools and prompts via a plugin registry.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The code uses standard async functions, class registries, and stream handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity are evident.\n- The flow of untrusted data (names, arguments) is typical for such server frameworks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the described functionality: listing tools/prompts, calling tools, getting prompts.\n- No discrepancies between the code and the reports’ summaries.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a standard plugin server with no malicious intent.\n- The reasoning about data flow and potential risks is accurate.\n- No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- All reports assign:\n  - **malware: 0**\n  - **obfuscated: 0**\n  - **securityRisk: 0.2 or 0.1**\n  - **confidence: 0.9 or 0.95**\n\nThese seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- The low scores reflect the absence of suspicious behavior.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code analysis.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they only describe the code’s behavior.\n- No claims about potential vulnerabilities are unjustified.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal security risk, standard plugin server)  \n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to external input handling, but overall very low risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code appears to be a standard, benign plugin server implementation with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities evident from this fragment. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; all scores are justified.",
