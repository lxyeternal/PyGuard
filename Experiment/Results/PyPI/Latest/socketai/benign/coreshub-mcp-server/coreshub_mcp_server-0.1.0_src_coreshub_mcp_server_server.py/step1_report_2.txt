{
  "purpose": "This code sets up an asynchronous MCP server that exposes tools and prompts via various endpoints for listing, calling, and retrieving prompts, primarily for internal or controlled use.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'coreshub_mcp_server.base_plugin', 'mcp.server', 'mcp.server.stdio', and 'mcp.types' modules; method parameters such as 'name' and 'arguments' that could receive external input.",
  "sinks": "Function calls like 'ToolRegistry.get_tool_class', 'ToolRegistry.get_prompt_class', and 'tool.execute_tool' may process external input; server methods like 'list_tools', 'call_tool', 'list_prompts', 'get_prompt' handling external requests and arguments.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'name' and 'arguments' are retrieved from external sources, passed through server methods, and used to fetch classes or execute tools/prompt functions, which could process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious or unusual code patterns observed; the code primarily initializes server routes and handlers without evident malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an MCP server with defined endpoints for listing and invoking tools and prompts. It uses class registries to dynamically retrieve tool and prompt classes based on external input. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communications to unknown domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions process input parameters to fetch classes and execute methods, which are typical for a plugin or server framework. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The structure appears standard and intended for legitimate use, assuming the underlying classes and methods are secure and trusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an asynchronous server interface exposing tool and prompt functionalities. No malicious behavior or malicious intent is evident. It primarily acts as a dispatcher for registered tools and prompts, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks based on this code fragment.",
