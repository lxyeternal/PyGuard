{
  "purpose": "This code sets up an MCP server with functionality to list and call tools, list prompts, and get prompts, serving as an API interface for tool execution and prompt management.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include arguments for tool and prompt functions, and server initialization options from the server object.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include responses from tool execution, prompt retrieval, and error messages, which are returned as data structures (e.g., TextContent, GetPromptResult).",
  "flows": "Untrusted data (arguments, names) flow from external inputs into function parameters, then are used to retrieve or instantiate classes, and generate responses; specifically, 'arguments' and 'name' are source points leading to potentially returned data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No suspicious or malicious code patterns such as network calls, file modifications, or obfuscated code are evident. Use of class registries and async functions appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a server with defined endpoints for listing tools and prompts, calling tools, and getting prompts, all through registered classes. Input data (e.g., tool names, arguments) are used to invoke class methods, and outputs are constructed from these class instances. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code follows typical patterns for a plugin-based server framework. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The only data flow concerns are normal API parameters; no signs of malicious data processing or sabotage are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard server implementation for managing tools and prompts via a plugin registry. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Overall, it seems to be a benign component of a larger system with no malicious intent.",
