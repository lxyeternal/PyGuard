{
  "purpose": "This code implements a plugin-based asynchronous server that manages tools and prompts via a registry, exposing endpoints for listing and invoking them.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'name' and 'arguments' used to fetch classes and invoke methods; external class registry ToolRegistry.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no data leaks or external data effects observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' and 'arguments' → ToolRegistry.get_tool_class / get_prompt_class → class instantiation and method execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard plugin server setup, utilizing class registries to dynamically handle tools and prompts. It processes external inputs to retrieve classes and execute methods asynchronously. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The code's structure and flow are typical for such systems, with no obfuscation or security flaws. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign plugin server implementation with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
