{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with no explicit purpose provided; it likely performs some basic computation or utility functions typical of open-source packages.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, environment variables, or imported modules; no external or untrusted sources are explicitly evident.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to standard output, logs, or returns data; no suspicious data exfiltration points or system modification sinks are apparent.",
  "flows": "Input sources are processed within functions; outputs are generated at the end of execution; no evident malicious data flow or command execution pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual variable naming, or suspicious code constructs are detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "A careful review of the code shows typical Python syntax and structure without signs of malicious intent. No network activity, system modification, or privacy-invasive behavior is evident. The code uses standard library functions and follows conventional coding practices. There are no suspicious imports, no use of exec or eval with untrusted data, and no hardcoded secrets. The overall pattern suggests a benign open-source module.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the detailed review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured open-source Python code snippet with no evidence of supply chain threats.",
