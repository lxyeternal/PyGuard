  "purpose": "Analysis of Python code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic execution (eval/exec), external communication, obfuscated variables, input data reading.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, environment variables, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input reading → processing → dynamic execution or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of eval/exec, suspicious external URLs, lack of clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns, which are typical indicators of malicious or suspicious activity. The absence of hardcoded credentials reduces certainty but does not eliminate risk. The suspicious external communication suggests potential data leakage or command-and-control activity. The overall structure and patterns align with obfuscated malware attempting to hide malicious intent. The suspicion level is moderate, with the potential for malicious behavior given the obfuscation and dynamic code usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicating moderate suspicion of malicious intent. No definitive malicious payload is confirmed, but the patterns warrant caution. The malware score should be set at 0.5 to reflect this suspicion, and the security risk remains elevated at 0.65 due to obfuscation and dynamic behavior.",
