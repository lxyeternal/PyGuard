{
  "purpose": "To invoke the main function from the coreshub_mcp_server module, likely to start a server or application process.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'coreshub_mcp_server' module, which may contain code that reads files, network data, or environment variables during import or execution.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'main()' could potentially lead to network connections, file access, or other sensitive operations depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Import 'coreshub_mcp_server' -> execute 'main()' function -> perform actions defined within 'main()' (unknown from this code).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets evident; the code is minimal and straightforward, delegating to another module.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple entry point that imports and executes a main function from another module. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'coreshub_mcp_server.main'. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs in this snippet. The minimal nature of this code makes it unlikely to contain malicious intent itself, but it warrants review of 'coreshub_mcp_server' for security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a straightforward launcher for another module's main process. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident from this snippet alone. The security of the overall package depends on the implementation of 'coreshub_mcp_server'.",
