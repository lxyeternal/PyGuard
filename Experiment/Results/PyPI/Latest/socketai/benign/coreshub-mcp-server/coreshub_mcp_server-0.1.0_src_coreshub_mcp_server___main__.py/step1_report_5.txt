  "purpose": "This script serves as the entry point for executing the main function from the 'coreshub_mcp_server' package.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'main' from 'coreshub_mcp_server' and calls it.",
  "sinks": "The code executes 'main()' which could lead to any number of operations within 'coreshub_mcp_server', but the source code itself does not reveal specific sinks.",
  "flows": "Import of 'main' -> call to 'main()' -> execution of code within 'coreshub_mcp_server' main function",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present in this minimal code. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual imports or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code functions solely as a launcher, importing and executing the 'main' function from an external module. It lacks any input handling, data processing, or suspicious patterns. Without insight into 'coreshub_mcp_server', no malicious activity can be inferred from this snippet alone. The code is straightforward and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code acts as a simple entry point that calls the main function from an external module. Based on the given snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
