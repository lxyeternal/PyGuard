  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the reported issues, scores, and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a minimal script that imports `main` from `coreshub_mcp_server` and executes it.\n- The core concern is that the actual behavior and security implications depend entirely on the implementation of `coreshub_mcp_server.main()`, which is not provided.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or anomalies are present in the script itself.\n- The reported malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious code in this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and assessments:\n\n**Code correctness:**\n- The code is straightforward: import and execute.\n- No issues are present in the code snippet itself.\n\n**Potential security risks:**\n- The main risk is if `coreshub_mcp_server.main()` contains malicious or insecure behavior.\n- Since the implementation of `main()` is unknown, the risk assessment relies on trust or further review of that module.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware score: all reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- Obfuscated: all 0, which is correct.\n- Security risk: mostly low (0.1 to 0.2), which seems reasonable given the minimal code and unknown implementation.\n\n**Analysis of reasoning:**\n- All reports correctly state that the security implications depend on the implementation of `coreshub_mcp_server.main()`.\n- They do not overstate or assume malicious behavior without evidence.\n- The conclusions are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided information.\n- The overall security posture hinges on reviewing `coreshub_mcp_server.main()`.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the minimal code and the reports' conclusions, I agree with the current scores and reasoning. The code itself is benign, and the risk is low unless the imported module is malicious.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code in this snippet)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, but always depends on external module)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple launcher with no inherent security issues. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of `coreshub_mcp_server`. A thorough review of that module is recommended for a comprehensive security assessment.",
