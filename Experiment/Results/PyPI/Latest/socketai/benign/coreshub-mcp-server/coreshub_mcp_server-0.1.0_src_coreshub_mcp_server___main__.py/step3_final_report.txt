  "purpose": "Minimal launcher script importing and executing 'main' from 'coreshub_mcp_server'.",
  "sources": "Import statement of 'coreshub_mcp_server' and call to 'main()'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'coreshub_mcp_server.main()' which may contain untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Import 'coreshub_mcp_server' -> call 'main()' -> execution of external module's code.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and call with no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple entry point that delegates execution to an external module. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'coreshub_mcp_server.main()', which is not provided. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk. The code itself is benign, and the assessment aligns with best practices for such minimal scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal launcher with no inherent security issues. The security posture depends on the external module's implementation. The current scores are appropriate, and no suspicious activity is detected in this snippet.",
