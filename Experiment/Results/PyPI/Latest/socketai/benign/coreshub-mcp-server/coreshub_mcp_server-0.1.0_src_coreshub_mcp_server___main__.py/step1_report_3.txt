  "purpose": "Invoke the main function from the coreshub_mcp_server module to run the server application.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'main' from 'coreshub_mcp_server' module.",
  "sinks": "Calling the 'main' function, which may execute server logic or other actions defined within 'coreshub_mcp_server'.",
  "flows": "Import from 'coreshub_mcp_server' -> calling 'main()' function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'main' function from a module named 'coreshub_mcp_server' and executes it immediately. There is no input handling, data processing, or network communication in this snippet. The behavior depends entirely on the implementation of 'main' in 'coreshub_mcp_server', which is not provided. Given the simplicity and lack of suspicious constructs, this appears to be standard entry point code for a Python application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical entry point script that invokes the main function of a server module. Based solely on this snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
