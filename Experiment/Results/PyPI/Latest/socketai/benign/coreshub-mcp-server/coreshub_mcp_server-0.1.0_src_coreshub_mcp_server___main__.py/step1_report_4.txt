{
  "purpose": "This script imports the 'main' function from the 'coreshub_mcp_server' module and executes it. Its purpose is to serve as an entry point to run the server or application defined within that module.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the imported module 'coreshub_mcp_server' when calling 'main()'.",
  "sinks": "The 'main()' function is invoked, which may contain various operations, but this script itself does not specify any data sinks.",
  "flows": "The script flows from importing 'main' from 'coreshub_mcp_server' to executing 'main()', which likely contains further data processing or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are evident in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a typical entry point, simply calling 'main()' from another module. Since it only delegates to 'main()', the security risk depends entirely on the implementation of 'main' within 'coreshub_mcp_server'. There are no embedded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic in this snippet. Without inspecting 'coreshub_mcp_server', no malicious behavior can be identified here.",
  "conclusion": "This is a basic entry point script that delegates execution to 'coreshub_mcp_server.main()'. There are no signs of malicious activity or security issues within this code snippet itself. Its safety depends on the implementation of the imported 'main' function.",
