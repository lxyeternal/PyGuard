  "purpose": "Import and execute the main function from the coreshub_mcp_server module to run the application.",
  "sources": "Import statement for coreshub_mcp_server and invocation of main()",
  "sinks": "The main() function call; potential for untrusted code execution depends on the implementation within coreshub_mcp_server",
  "flows": "Import of module -> execution of main()",
  "anomalies": "Lack of inline code or configuration; dependence on external module for core functionality",
  "analysis": "The script simply imports a main function from a module and executes it. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code snippets present. The security and maliciousness depend entirely on the implementation of main() within coreshub_mcp_server, which is not provided here. The code itself is straightforward and minimal, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code acts as a launcher for another module's main function. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident within this script itself. Its security assessment relies on the trustworthiness of the coreshub_mcp_server module, which is outside the scope of this review.",
