  "purpose": "Define a configuration class that loads sensitive credentials from environment variables for use in the application.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: QY_ACCESS_KEY_ID, QY_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, CORESHUB_USER_ID",
  "sinks": "None directly; environment variables are read but not transmitted or written elsewhere in the code",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> class attributes (access_key, secret_key, user_id)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no suspicious code or backdoors; straightforward environment variable access",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Settings class with a static base_url. It retrieves sensitive data (access key, secret key, user ID) from environment variables, which is a standard practice for managing secrets securely. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior is observed. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. It simply loads configuration values at runtime.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for loading credentials securely via environment variables. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
