  "purpose": "Store configuration settings including URL and access credentials using environment variables",
  "sources": "Environment variables: 'QY_ACCESS_KEY_ID', 'QY_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', 'CORESHUB_USER_ID'",
  "sinks": "Access to environment variables which hold sensitive data; no direct output or data leak mechanisms",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read during class variable initialization and assigned to class attributes",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for sensitive credentials is standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Settings class with static attributes, including a URL and credentials fetched from environment variables. No data is transmitted or processed insecurely; no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. The use of environment variables for secrets is best practice, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code is straightforward and functional for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code securely loads sensitive credentials via environment variables and does not contain malicious behavior or anomalies. No security risks identified based on this fragment.",
