  "purpose": "Define configuration settings including sensitive credentials retrieved from environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: 'QY_ACCESS_KEY_ID', 'QY_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', 'CORESHUB_USER_ID'.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of the retrieved credentials in network operations or API calls (not shown in this snippet).",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> class attributes -> potential downstream use in network/authentication functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for credentials is standard; no hardcoded secrets. No suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Settings class with a fixed base URL and retrieves credentials from environment variables, which is a common secure practice. There is no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code does not perform any harmful actions such as network connections, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The structure is straightforward, and no anomalies are apparent. It appears to be a standard configuration pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration class with environment-based credential loading. No malicious intent or security risks are evident in this code snippet.",
