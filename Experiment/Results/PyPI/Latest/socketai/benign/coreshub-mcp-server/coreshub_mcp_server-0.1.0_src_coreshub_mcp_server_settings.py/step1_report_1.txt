  "purpose": "Define configuration settings with environment variables for credentials and base URL",
  "sources": "os.getenv() calls to retrieve environment variables: QY_ACCESS_KEY_ID, QY_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, CORESHUB_USER_ID",
  "sinks": "Potential use of retrieved credentials for network requests or authentication processes",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at runtime and assigned to class attributes; these can be used later in the program for network or security-related operations",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; standard use of environment variables; no unusual code structures or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Settings class with static attributes for base URL and credentials. Credentials are retrieved from environment variables, which is a best practice for security. The code creates a singleton settings instance. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The structure is straightforward and typical for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup retrieving credentials from environment variables. No malicious intent or suspicious activity detected. It appears to be a legitimate and safe implementation for managing configuration data.",
