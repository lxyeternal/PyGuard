{
  "purpose": "Defines a Settings class that stores configuration data, including sensitive keys, and creates a singleton instance for application use.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: QY_ACCESS_KEY_ID, QY_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, CORESHUB_USER_ID",
  "sinks": "None directly, but environment variables are used to populate sensitive attributes.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> Settings attributes (access_key, secret_key, user_id) -> Application logic",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for sensitive credentials is standard; no suspicious hardcoding or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a static URL and fetches sensitive data from environment variables, which is a common and acceptable practice for managing secrets. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present. The environment variables are used securely, and the code only creates a singleton instance. There are no suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscated logic. Overall, this code appears to be a standard configuration setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration class that safely reads sensitive data from environment variables. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It’s a standard, low-risk implementation for managing application settings.",
