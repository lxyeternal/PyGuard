  "purpose": "Load configuration settings including sensitive credentials from environment variables for application use.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: QY_ACCESS_KEY_ID, QY_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, CORESHUB_USER_ID",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or network transmissions; only assigns environment variable values to class attributes",
  "flows": "Environment variables → class attributes in Settings instance",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward environment variable access without obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Settings class with static attributes for base URL and credentials, retrieved via os.getenv() from environment variables. It creates a singleton instance for configuration. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code follows standard practices for configuration management. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate. The only potential concern is the security of environment variables outside this code, but within the code itself, no issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, secure configuration pattern that loads sensitive credentials from environment variables without malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned scores are justified; the malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1). No modifications are necessary.",
