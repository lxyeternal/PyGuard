  "purpose": "A CLI tool for managing connection codes and encoding/decoding files using base64, with file listing capabilities.",
  "sources": "Input from command-line arguments, reading/writing files ('connection_code.txt', target files, and encoded files).",
  "sinks": "Reading and writing files, base64 encoding/decoding data, printing output to console.",
  "flows": "User provides command-line input -> code processes command -> reads/writes files or encodes/decodes data -> outputs results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code relies on file existence for connection codes. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script generates a numeric connection code, stores it in a file, and verifies it. It lists directory contents, encodes files into base64, and decodes base64 files back to binary. All file operations are straightforward. No external network connections, no data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. Use of the 'colorama' library is only for user interface styling. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple file management utility with connection code handling. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior, and no security risks are apparent beyond standard file I/O operations. The code appears benign and appropriate for its described purpose.",
