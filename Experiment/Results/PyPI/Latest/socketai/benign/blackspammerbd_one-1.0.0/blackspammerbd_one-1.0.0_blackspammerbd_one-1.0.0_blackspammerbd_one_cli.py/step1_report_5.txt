{
  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface for generating, verifying, listing, encoding, and decoding files, potentially for remote file management or data exchange.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments; reading from 'connection_code.txt'; reading files for encoding and decoding.",
  "sinks": "Writing connection code to 'connection_code.txt'; writing encoded data to '.b64' files; writing decoded data to 'uploaded_' files; printing output messages.",
  "flows": "Input commands → generate or verify connection codes / list files / encode files / decode files → read/write files and display output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random number generation for connection codes, which is not inherently suspicious but could be used for session tokens; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; base64 encoding for file transfer which could be used to exfiltrate data if integrated with network communication but is not in this code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic file management and encoding/decoding functionalities with no evidence of malicious intent. It uses standard libraries and methods. The connection code generation uses random digits, which is not cryptographically secure but does not necessarily imply malicious behavior. No network connections or data exfiltration code are present. The script's operations are straightforward, primarily involving file I/O, with no suspicious or hidden behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate utility for file encoding and connection code management. There is no indication of malicious behavior, malware, or supply chain attacks. It performs simple, safe file operations with no network activity or suspicious logic.",
