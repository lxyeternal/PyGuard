  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility with no malicious or obfuscated components. The low security risk score is justified by the lack of cryptographic security in connection code generation and absence of network activity. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign appropriate scores. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). No modifications are necessary; the code is safe for use as intended."
