  "purpose": "A command-line tool for managing a connection code, listing files, and encoding/decoding files with base64.",
  "sources": "Reading the connection code from 'connection_code.txt'; reading files for encoding; reading encoded files for decoding.",
  "sinks": "Writing the connection code to 'connection_code.txt'; writing encoded data to a new file; writing decoded data to a file; printing outputs.",
  "flows": "start_command() generates and saves a code -> connect_command() reads code for verification -> list_command() reads directory -> download_command() reads a file, encodes, writes to new file -> upload_command() reads encoded file, decodes, writes output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random.randint for connection code; no input validation or sanitization; potential overwriting of files; no obfuscation; no suspicious network activity; straightforward base64 encoding/decoding.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs file operations, base64 encoding/decoding, and simple CLI interactions. The connection code is randomly generated and stored locally, with no network transmission involved. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. All operations appear standard and benign. The code does not contain obfuscation, suspicious dynamic execution, or hidden backdoors. Its behavior aligns with typical CLI file management utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI utility for managing a connection code and encoding/decoding files. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided implementation.",
