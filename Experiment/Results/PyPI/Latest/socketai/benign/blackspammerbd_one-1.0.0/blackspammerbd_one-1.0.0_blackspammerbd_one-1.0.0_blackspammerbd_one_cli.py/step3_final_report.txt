  "purpose": "A CLI utility for generating, verifying, and managing connection codes; listing directory contents; encoding and decoding files with base64.",
  "sources": "Reads connection code from 'connection_code.txt'; reads files for encoding/decoding; takes command-line arguments for operations.",
  "sinks": "Reads from files; writes to files; outputs to console; no external network activity.",
  "flows": "Input (connection code or filename) -> file operations or verification -> console output or file output.",
  "anomalies": "Uses non-cryptographic random for connection code; no input validation or sanitization; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file I/O and simple string operations. No network activity, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets. Connection code generation is insecure but not malicious. No suspicious logic or malicious payloads detected. The use of base64 encoding is standard but not secure for sensitive data. The code's structure is clear and readable, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The security risk stems mainly from the weak randomness for connection codes, but this does not constitute malicious behavior. No malware, backdoors, or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility with no malicious or obfuscated components. The low security risk score is justified by the lack of cryptographic security in connection code generation and absence of network activity. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign appropriate scores. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). No modifications are necessary; the code is safe for use as intended.",
