  "purpose": "A command-line interface for a file sharing and transfer utility that allows connection, file listing, uploading, downloading, and sharing via a generated code.",
  "sources": "User input via input() function; filename arguments from command-line commands.",
  "sinks": "os.listdir, shutil.copy, and print statements; network activity is not directly present but sharing links could lead to data exposure.",
  "flows": "User input triggers command parsing, which calls methods that access the filesystem and generate responses, potentially exposing filenames and sharing links.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; the connection logic relies solely on matching a generated code. The sharing link is hardcoded but not malicious. No malicious code execution or network connections are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic file management system controlled via CLI commands. It generates a numeric code for connection, which must be matched to enable further operations. File operations (list, upload, download) are filesystem interactions without external network activity. The sharing feature provides a link with the filename but does not perform network operations itself. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. It appears to be a benign utility that could be misused if access is improperly secured, but does not show signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple file sharing utility with command-line interface, lacking any malicious code, backdoors, or network activity. It does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks beyond potential unauthorized file access if misused. No malware signals detected.",
