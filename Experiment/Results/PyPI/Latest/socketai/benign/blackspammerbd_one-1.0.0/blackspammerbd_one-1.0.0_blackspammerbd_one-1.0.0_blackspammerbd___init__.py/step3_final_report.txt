{
  "purpose": "The code imports the class BlackSpammerBD from a local core module, likely for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or output occurs here.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows; this is a static import with no execution or data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in this minimal code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of a class named BlackSpammerBD from a local module core. No executable logic, data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is evident. The class name suggests potential spam or abuse functionality, but the import alone does not demonstrate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (~0.1). The confidence levels are high, reflecting the simplicity of the code. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues is found in this snippet. The potential concern is the class name, but without implementation details, this remains speculative.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and does not pose any security risk. The class name alone does not indicate malicious intent, and the code snippet contains no suspicious or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent with the evidence. No further action or suspicion is warranted based solely on this snippet.",
