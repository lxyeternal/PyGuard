{
  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'bytedance_mcp_rap_platform' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; input parameters to setup() function.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file read (README.md) into long_description parameter; package configuration data into setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read README.md without try-except, but this is standard for package setup; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. It uses setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. The only notable aspect is reading the README file directly, which is standard practice. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network activity, code injection, or backdoors. No anomalous code or obfuscation detected. The script appears to serve a legitimate purpose of package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and reads a README file for description.",
