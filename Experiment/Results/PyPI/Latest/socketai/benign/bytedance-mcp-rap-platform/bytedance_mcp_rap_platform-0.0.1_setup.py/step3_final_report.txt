  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, reading local README.md for long description.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file from local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads local file into 'long_description'; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard setup script with typical practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script utilizing setuptools to define package metadata. It reads a local README.md file for the long description, which is common practice. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or untrusted inputs. The author fields are placeholders, typical in initial templates. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code adheres to best practices for package configuration and contains no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and safe. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
