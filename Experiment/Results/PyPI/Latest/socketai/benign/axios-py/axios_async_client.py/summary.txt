  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard async HTTP client with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk score (0.2) is appropriate, primarily due to external dependencies and unvalidated inputs, which are typical considerations for such code. No malware detected, and the code structure is sound."
