  "purpose": "The code provides module imports and metadata for a Python HTTP client library supporting sync and async operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module imports and version metadata; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks, code execution, or other security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present; the code solely imports modules and sets exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific components from relative modules, defines a version string, and lists exports. It contains no dynamic execution, input handling, or network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module bootstrap with no malicious or security-related issues. It simply sets up the module's API surface without performing any sensitive operations.",
