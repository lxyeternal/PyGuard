  "purpose": "This module serves as an entry point for an Axios-like HTTP client library in Python, providing imports and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.core, .types, .http_client, .async_client, .rate_limiter)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external inputs, or data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only re-exports classes and variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are observed. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various components of the package and sets metadata variables. It does not process data, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The module functions as a simple aggregator of internal classes and types.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages imports and exports for a Python HTTP client library.",
