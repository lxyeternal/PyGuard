{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package that provides an HTTP client called Axios with support for synchronous and asynchronous operations, as well as rate limiting features.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are explicitly present in this snippet; it mainly imports modules and defines package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or sensitive data output is present in this code; it is solely importing modules and setting public API symbols.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted input or output; the code only establishes module structure and exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and standard for a Python package's __init__.py file; no unusual or suspicious code segments, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports core components, type definitions, HTTP client classes, and rate limiting modules, then defines version info and public API exports. It appears to be a typical package initialization file. No code execution, input reading, or data manipulation occurs here. It does not contain any obfuscated code, malicious functions, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this analysis, the code is a standard package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply sets up exports for a Python HTTP client library. There are no security risks identified in this code segment.",
