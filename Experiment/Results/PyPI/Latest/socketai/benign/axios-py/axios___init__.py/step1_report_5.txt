{
  "purpose": "This module provides a Python HTTP client library named Axios, supporting sync and async operations, along with rate limiting features.",
  "sources": "The code imports components from local modules: core, types, http_client, async_client, and rate_limiter.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in this code snippet; potential data flow to untrusted sources would depend on the imported modules' internal implementations.",
  "flows": "Data flow would involve user inputs or external data passing into the imported classes and functions at runtime, which are not shown here.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present in this code snippet. It appears to be a typical module index file with imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module definition that imports specific classes and functions and exposes them via __all__. There are no visible signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. Since all imported modules are local and named suggestively, they appear to be legitimate components of an HTTP client library. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling occurs in this snippet. The code structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py or main module file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package entry point with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security issues. It serves as an organized interface for the library components without any suspicious or harmful code.",
