  "purpose": "Implement a token bucket-based rate limiter for managing request limits on different endpoints",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters (requests_per_second, burst_size, max_queue_size), system time (time.time()), and data from function parameters (endpoint names, configs)",
  "sinks": "Modifies internal token count, potentially affects request rate control, but no direct data leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters -> RateLimiter instance -> acquire() method -> token management -> request handling",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious logic, no obfuscation or hidden behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard token bucket rate limiting mechanism with configurable parameters, supports multiple endpoint limits, and manages internal state with thread-safe async locks. It reads system time for rate calculations and updates tokens accordingly. No hardcoded credentials, external data leaks, or malicious actions are evident. The design appears to be a straightforward, well-structured rate limiter implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard rate limiting approach with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate component intended for controlling request rates in an application.",
