  "purpose": "Implementation of an asynchronous token bucket rate limiter with per-endpoint management and configuration updates.",
  "sources": "Time functions for token replenishment, configuration parameters for rate limits, internal state variables for tokens and timestamps.",
  "sinks": "Internal state updates; no external data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input configurations update internal parameters; acquire methods modify token count; endpoint-specific limiters manage their own state.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of an asynchronous token bucket rate limiter. It manages internal state safely with asyncio.Lock, replenishes tokens based on elapsed time, and supports per-endpoint configurations. No external data is transmitted, and no malicious or obfuscated code is present. The logic aligns with common practices, and the code appears correct and secure. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage are evident. The configuration update method appropriately adjusts tokens without security implications. Overall, the code is benign and suitable for production use with proper configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an asynchronous rate limiter with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments are accurate; the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal configuration or implementation concerns. No further security concerns are identified.",
