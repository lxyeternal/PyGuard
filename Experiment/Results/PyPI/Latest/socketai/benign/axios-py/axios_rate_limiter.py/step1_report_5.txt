  "purpose": "Implement a token bucket rate limiter to control request rates for different endpoints",
  "sources": "Input data: None explicitly read from external sources; data read from method parameters and system time",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the asyncio sleep call which controls request pacing; no external data is written or transmitted",
  "flows": "Method calls acquire() from RateLimiter instances, which manage token counts and delays",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or system modifications. No malicious backdoors, data leaks, or unauthorized system access detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard token bucket rate limiter with support for multiple endpoints. It manages tokens based on time and allows dynamic configuration. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is apparent. Usage of asyncio locks and sleeps for rate control appears legitimate. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. The design appears to be a typical rate limiting implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an asynchronous rate limiter using token bucket algorithm. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as expected for managing request rates without compromising security.",
