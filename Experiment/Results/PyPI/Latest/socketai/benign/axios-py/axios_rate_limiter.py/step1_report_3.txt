  "purpose": "Implement rate limiting using the token bucket algorithm to control request flow per endpoint.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include configuration parameters for rate limits, function parameters such as endpoint names, and external calls to acquire tokens.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the token decrement operation, which controls request flow. No external data sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or system modification are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (configurations, endpoint names) influence internal state (tokens, limiter objects). The acquire methods manage token consumption and waiting. No external untrusted data flows to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an in-memory rate limiter using a token bucket algorithm with asyncio support. It manages rate limits per endpoint, with methods to update configurations and acquire tokens asynchronously. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are observed. The structure and logic appear normal for a rate limiting utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of rate limiting without signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It appears suitable for use in managing request flow. No malicious or security-compromising behaviors are detected.",
