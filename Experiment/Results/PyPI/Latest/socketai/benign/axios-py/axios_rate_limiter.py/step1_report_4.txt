{
  "purpose": "Implement a rate limiting mechanism using the token bucket algorithm to control request rates per endpoint.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters (requests_per_second, burst_size), time data via time.time(), and asyncio Lock for concurrency control.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows to cause data leaks or harmful effects; all data handling is internal and controlled.",
  "flows": "Input configurations and endpoint identifiers influence the rate limiter behavior; the flow involves acquiring tokens to proceed with requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The logic is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an in-memory rate limiting implementation with configurable parameters, managing tokens via the token bucket algorithm. It uses standard libraries (time, asyncio) without external inputs or outputs that could be malicious. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. All functions are for rate management, with no malicious sinks or sources identified. The code appears well-structured and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard rate limiter without any malicious intent or suspicious features. It is safe from a security perspective, with no evidence of malware or security risks present.",
