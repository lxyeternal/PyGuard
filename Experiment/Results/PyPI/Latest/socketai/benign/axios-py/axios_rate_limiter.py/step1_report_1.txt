{
  "purpose": "Implement a rate limiter using token bucket algorithm for managing request rates per endpoint.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters such as 'endpoint', configuration updates, and internal time-based calculations.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes untrusted data to external systems; it manages internal state only.",
  "flows": "Input (endpoint or config) -> internal method calls -> rate limiter tokens -> acquire method decreasing tokens",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Uses standard libraries and practices. No obfuscated code or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for rate limiting, including configuration, token bucket logic, and management per endpoint. It uses asyncio for concurrency control and time-based token replenishment. No external network connections, data leakage, or malicious behavior detected. The logic appears sound for a typical rate limiter implementation, with no signs of malicious payloads or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of an asynchronous rate limiter using token bucket algorithm. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. It is safe for use, assuming proper usage and no external malicious modifications.",
