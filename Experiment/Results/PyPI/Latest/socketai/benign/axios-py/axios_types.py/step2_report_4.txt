  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Security Risks:**  \n   All reports consistently indicate that the code is solely composed of type annotations and data class definitions for Axios request and response structures. There are no runtime behaviors, external data processing, network calls, or input handling. The code is static and declarative.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \n   The reports do not identify any errors or flaws. The code appears syntactically correct, well-structured, and appropriate for its purpose as type hints.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. This is appropriate.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n4. **Potential Assumptions or Overreach:**  \n   No report makes unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent. They all correctly interpret the code as purely structural/type definitions.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and reasonable given the content.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**  \n   Since the code is purely declarative, there is no scope for runtime exploits or malicious payloads. The code could be part of a larger project, but as-is, it is safe.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThis code is a benign, standard set of type definitions with no security concerns. It is safe and well-justified to assign all scores as zero.",
