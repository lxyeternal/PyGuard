  "purpose": "Type definitions for Axios, a library for making HTTP requests, specifying configuration and response data structures.",
  "sources": "No user input or external data sources are read; the code solely defines data classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or other security issues, as this code only contains type annotations and class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only defines structures without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. The code appears straightforward and typical for type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines two dataclasses: AxiosRequestConfig and AxiosResponse. These classes specify request configuration options and response structure for Axios. No user input, external data processing, or unsafe code practices are present. The code is purely declarative, serving as type hints for a larger codebase. There are no apparent security risks or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple set of type definitions for Axios request configurations and responses. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks. It is a benign, standard component of a type-annotated Python project.",
