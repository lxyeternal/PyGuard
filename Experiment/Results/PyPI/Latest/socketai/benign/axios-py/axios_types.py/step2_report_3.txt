  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code only contains type definitions using Python dataclasses for Axios request configurations and responses. There are no runtime behaviors, external data processing, or network calls. No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is purely declarative, with no malicious or risky behavior. No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign scores of 0 for malware and security risk, which aligns with the code's benign nature. Given the lack of any suspicious activity, these scores are appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code contains no runtime logic, no external data handling, and no security-sensitive operations, there's no justification for a high risk score. The code is purely structural.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden payloads.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports correctly dismiss any potential vulnerabilities as baseless, given the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis—no suspicious activity or security issues are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, standard set of type annotations and data class definitions for Axios request and response structures. It does not process untrusted data, does not perform any external actions, and contains no malicious or suspicious constructs.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is entirely benign. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No issues or malicious behavior detected.  \n- Scores are reasonable and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
