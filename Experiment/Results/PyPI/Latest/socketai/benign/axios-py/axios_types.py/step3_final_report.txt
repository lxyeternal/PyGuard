  "purpose": "Type definitions for Axios request configuration and response data structures in Python",
  "sources": "No runtime data input; static class definitions only",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "None; purely declarative data structures without data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, well-structured type annotations",
  "analysis": "The code defines two data classes for Axios request configuration and response, serving as static type hints. It contains no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code is purely declarative, with no data flows or sinks, and does not process untrusted data. The security implications are minimal; the code is safe and standard for type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
