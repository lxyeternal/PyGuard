  "purpose": "Type definitions for Axios, providing structured data classes for request configuration and response handling.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; the code defines classes and their default values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external interactions; no functions executing external commands or network calls.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward type annotations and data class definitions without any unusual constructs or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for Axios request configuration and responses. It uses standard Python typing and dataclasses, with no input processing, external data reading, or malicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no external calls are present. The code is purely structural/type definition and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type annotation and data class setup for Axios request/response modeling. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
