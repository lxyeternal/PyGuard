  "purpose": "Type definitions for Axios request and response configuration in Python",
  "sources": "No input data sources; defines data structures",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform external actions",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines classes",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior; standard use of dataclasses and type hints",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures for Axios request configuration and responses using dataclasses, type hints, and optional parameters. No input processing, external data handling, or runtime execution logic is present. It appears to be a straightforward type definition module with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type definition module for Axios-like request configurations in Python. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks.",
