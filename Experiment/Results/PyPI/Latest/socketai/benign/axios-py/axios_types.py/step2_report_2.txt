  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is purely defining data structures for Axios request configurations and responses using Python dataclasses. There are no runtime behaviors, data processing, or external interactions. The code is straightforward and does not contain any malicious or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They uniformly state that the code is benign, with no signs of security risks, obfuscation, or malware. No flaws or logical errors are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.  \n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious content.  \n   - **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely declarative type definitions with no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions, there is no basis for assigning a higher risk score. The reports' scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any actions, data processing, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid assumptions about potential vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign set of type definitions with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and well-founded.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The current scoring accurately reflects this assessment.",
