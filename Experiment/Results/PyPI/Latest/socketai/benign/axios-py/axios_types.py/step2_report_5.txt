  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Nature:**\n   - The provided code defines two data classes (`AxiosRequestConfig` and `AxiosResponse`) using Python's `dataclasses` and type hints.\n   - It is purely declarative, serving as type annotations or data structures for a larger codebase.\n   - There are no runtime functions, input handling, network calls, or external data processing.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Security Risks and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code does not process untrusted data, read from external sources, or execute any commands.\n   - No sinks (e.g., network, file system, subprocesses) are present.\n   - No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines static data structures.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n   - They assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n   - The confidence is high (1), which aligns with the straightforward analysis.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which is justified.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0, since the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk score:** 0, because the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities or risks.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Overestimations:**\n   - No report suggests any suspicious or malicious behavior that warrants a higher score.\n   - The code is purely structural and does not execute or process data at runtime.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are consistent and appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary; the code is benign and safe.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis code is a standard, benign set of type definitions for Axios request and response structures in Python. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The reports' assessments are accurate and align with my analysis.",
