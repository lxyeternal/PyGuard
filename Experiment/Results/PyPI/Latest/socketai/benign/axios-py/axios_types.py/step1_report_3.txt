  "sources": "No input sources are read; this code only defines data classes and types.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks, as this code only defines types.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines data classes for Axios request configuration and responses using Python's dataclasses. It contains no runtime logic, input handling, network calls, or external data processing. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code appears to be a standard, benign type definition module to assist with type checking and code clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type definitions for Axios request and response structures. There are no malicious or security concerns detected.",
