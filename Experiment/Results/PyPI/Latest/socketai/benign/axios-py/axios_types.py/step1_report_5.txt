  "purpose": "Type definitions for Axios request and response configurations in Python",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading sources are present in this code",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output functions that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects",
  "flows": "No data flow paths exist as there are only data class definitions without logic or functions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code solely consists of data class definitions with standard type annotations",
  "analysis": "The code provides data class definitions for Axios request and response configurations, including type annotations and optional fields. There are no data handling, user input, network calls, or executable logic present. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation features are evident. The code appears to be standard type definition code intended to facilitate type checking and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely type definitions for Axios request/response structures with no malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no input/output, network activity, or logic that could be exploited or malicious. Overall, the code is safe and straightforward.",
