  "purpose": "Implement a custom HTTP client for making HTTP requests with support for various methods and handling responses.",
  "sources": "User-supplied URL, request parameters, headers, data (including json_data, data, or raw bytes).",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() call which sends the request; response data handling for potential injection or data leaks.",
  "flows": "User input (URL, params, headers, data) flows into request preparation, then into urllib.request.Request, and finally the response data flows back through response.read() and JSON parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL manipulations, or unusual code constructs. The code uses standard libraries and practices. Exception handling is typical; no obfuscated code or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs HTTP requests dynamically based on user input, handling different data formats and headers, and processes responses including JSON decoding. It manages exceptions related to HTTP errors and URL errors. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The request method is flexible, but it does not include any mechanisms for untrusted code execution, code injection, or external data leaks. Response handling is standard, and no suspicious behaviors like sending data over the network without user intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an HTTP client using Python's standard library. It performs expected functions without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No malware or security risks are identified. The code appears safe and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent.",
