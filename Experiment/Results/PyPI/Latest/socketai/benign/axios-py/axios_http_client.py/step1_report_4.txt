  "purpose": "Implementation of a custom HTTP client to perform various HTTP methods with flexible parameters and headers.",
  "sources": "User-provided URL, request parameters (params, data, json_data), optional headers, and timeout settings.",
  "sinks": "Making HTTP requests via urllib.request.urlopen, which can potentially send untrusted data over the network.",
  "flows": "Input data (params, data, json_data, headers) flows into the request preparation, then into urllib.request.Request, and finally to urllib.request.urlopen, which transmits data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. No evidence of malicious intent in request handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard implementation of an HTTP client using urllib, including methods for various HTTP verbs. It processes input parameters to build requests and handles responses, including JSON parsing. Error handling captures HTTPError and URLError, with HTTP errors returning status and content. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors, are evident. The code operates as a typical HTTP client without malicious side effects or malicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, straightforward HTTP client implementation without malicious intent or security risks. It handles network requests responsibly, with standard error handling and data processing.",
