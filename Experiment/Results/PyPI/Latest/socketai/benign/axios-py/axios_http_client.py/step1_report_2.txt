  "purpose": "Implement a customizable HTTP client for making various HTTP requests",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as url, params, data, json_data, headers, and method in request functions",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen, response.read, json.loads",
  "flows": "User inputs (url, params, data, headers) -> request preparation -> urllib.request.Request -> urlopen -> response reading -> data parsing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution or unusual data handling observed",
  "analysis": "The code constructs HTTP requests with user-provided data and headers, and processes responses accordingly. It includes standard error handling for HTTPError and URLError. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious external communications are present. The class methods are straightforward wrappers around urllib functionalities, with no evidence of hidden or malicious code. No use of insecure practices such as insecure random number generation or unsafe SQL. The code structure is clear and standard for an HTTP client implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of an HTTP client library with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It handles requests and responses securely within expected norms. No indicators of malware, supply chain attacks, or malicious side-effects are identified.",
