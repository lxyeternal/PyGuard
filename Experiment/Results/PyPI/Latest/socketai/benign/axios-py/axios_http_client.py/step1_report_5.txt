  "purpose": "Implement a custom HTTP client to facilitate HTTP requests with flexible options for various methods.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'url', 'params', 'data', 'json_data', 'headers', and 'timeout' in the request methods.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen for network communication; response.read() for reading server responses.",
  "flows": "User provides request parameters -> request method prepares request data and headers -> request sent via urllib.request.urlopen -> response received and processed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL patterns, or unusual code constructs. Standard HTTP request implementation with proper error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for making HTTP requests with customizable headers, parameters, and data. It supports multiple HTTP methods. Data is encoded appropriately based on content type. Error handling captures HTTP errors and raises exceptions for URL errors. No indications of malicious or suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of an HTTP client without obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard HTTP client implementation without malicious intent. It handles network requests securely with proper error handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
