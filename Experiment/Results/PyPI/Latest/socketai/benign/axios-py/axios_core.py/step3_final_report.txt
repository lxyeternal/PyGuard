  "purpose": "Implementation of a flexible HTTP client supporting synchronous and asynchronous requests with rate limiting capabilities.",
  "sources": "Configuration objects, request parameters, external modules (types, http_client, async_client, rate_limiter)",
  "sinks": "Request method calls, response handling, configuration merging",
  "flows": "Config data flows from method parameters to request calls; external modules handle network communication; rate limiter influences request pacing",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an HTTP client wrapper supporting sync and async operations, with configuration merging and rate limiting. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is evident. External modules are used for core functionalities, but no signs of malicious activity or security flaws are present. The code structure is clear, and the logic aligns with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscation score is 0, and the overall risk score is 0.1, reflecting the low likelihood of security issues.",
