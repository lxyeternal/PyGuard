  "purpose": "Implementing an HTTP client supporting both synchronous and asynchronous requests with rate limiting.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.types, .http_client, .async_client, .rate_limiter), input parameters (URLs, configs), class initialization, and method arguments.",
  "sinks": "Request methods (request, arequest, get, post, etc.) which send data over the network; configuration attributes that could include sensitive info; rate limiter settings that could modify request flow.",
  "flows": "Input URLs and configs flow into request methods, merged configs are passed to HTTP clients, which perform network requests. Rate limit settings influence request flow, but do not process untrusted data directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. No unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or misleading variable usage. The rate limiter configuration appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an HTTP client wrapper supporting sync and async operations with rate limiting. It merges configs, manages sessions, and performs network requests without evident data leaks or malicious payloads. The only external data flows are URLs and configs which are typical for HTTP clients. No hardcoded secrets, or potentially malicious behaviors like data exfiltration or system modifications are present. The rate limiter is used for request flow control and does not perform any malicious activity. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, straightforward HTTP client implementation with no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a typical HTTP client wrapper with sync/async support and rate limiting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code's purpose is clear and seems intended for legitimate network request handling. No security threats or malware indicators identified.",
