  "purpose": "Implementation of an Axios-like HTTP client supporting both synchronous and asynchronous requests, with optional rate limiting.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters (URLs, configs, data), config attributes, and external modules (http_client, async_client, rate_limiter).",
  "sinks": "Making HTTP requests via http_client.request and async_client.request; setting rate limits through rate_limit_manager; modifying config attributes.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (URLs, configs) are merged and passed to request functions, which invoke external HTTP request methods; rate limit settings are configured via dedicated methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. No unusual code behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code mostly calls external modules without internal malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Axios class that wraps HTTP request functionality with both sync and async methods, using external HTTP clients and a rate limiter. The class includes standard request methods and configuration merging, with no embedded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads. The logic appears to follow typical patterns for HTTP clients. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present within this module. The rate limiting and request handling are straightforward, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an HTTP client with support for rate limiting and both sync/async requests. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks were found. It appears safe and legitimate in its current form.",
