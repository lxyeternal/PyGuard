  "purpose": "FastAPI dependency wrapper for Axios client instantiation and management",
  "sources": "Configuration parameter passed to AxiosDependency; internal creation of Axios instance within __call__ method",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external data processing occurs",
  "flows": "Configuration flows from get_axios to AxiosDependency; Axios instance created and yielded within async context",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual control flows detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard FastAPI dependency class that manages an Axios client instance asynchronously. It employs typical dependency injection patterns, with no handling of untrusted data, secrets, or network anomalies. The class uses async context management correctly, and the configuration is passed directly without validation issues. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements are present. The code's simplicity and adherence to common patterns support a benign assessment. All signals indicate no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured FastAPI dependency wrapper for an Axios client. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
