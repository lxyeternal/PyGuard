  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code is a straightforward FastAPI dependency wrapper for an Axios client, using async context management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The code does not process untrusted data, handle secrets, or perform network operations beyond standard HTTP client instantiation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:  \n   The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and standard. They correctly identify the absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and security risks of 0 or very close to zero. These are appropriate given the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores (>0.5)**:  \n   Since the code is purely a dependency wrapper with no malicious or risky behavior, assigning a high risk score would be unjustified. The scores of 0 or near-zero are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature. No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not rely on assumptions; they base their conclusions on code structure, patterns, and behavior, all of which are benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis provided in each report.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Remarks:\nGiven the simplicity and clarity of the code, the dependency pattern, and the absence of any suspicious elements, I agree with the reports' assessments. The overall security posture is benign.\n\n**Summary**:  \n- The code is a standard FastAPI dependency wrapper for Axios.  \n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.  \n- Scores should remain at 0 for malware and obfuscated, and 0 for overall risk.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \nMaintain the current scoring; no changes necessary.",
