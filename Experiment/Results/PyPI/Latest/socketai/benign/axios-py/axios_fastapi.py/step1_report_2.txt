  "purpose": "Provide a FastAPI dependency for creating and managing an Axios client instance with optional configuration.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in constructor (__init__) for config; function arguments in get_axios() for config.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of Axios client within __call__ method, used as an async context manager.",
  "flows": "Configuration passed to AxiosDependency, used when creating Axios instance in __call__, then yielded.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated code. Use of async context manager appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dependency class for FastAPI that manages an Axios client instance with optional configuration. The class constructor accepts configuration parameters, and the __call__ method creates an Axios instance within an async context, then yields it for use in FastAPI endpoints. The get_axios function returns an AxiosDependency object with optional config. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Usage of dependencies and context managers aligns with standard patterns. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard FastAPI dependency setup for Axios with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It manages client instantiation cleanly and securely without suspicious or malicious code. No security risks are detected.",
