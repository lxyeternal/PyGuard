  "purpose": "Provide a FastAPI dependency wrapper for the Axios client to facilitate HTTP requests within a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Reading the AxiosRequestConfig parameter in the constructor, calling the __call__ method to create an Axios instance.",
  "sinks": "The creation of Axios instances and potential data flows if Axios internally processes untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of AxiosDependency with optional config -> invocation of __call__ -> creation of Axios client instance.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flow observed. Usage appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dependency class for FastAPI to instantiate and manage Axios clients asynchronously. The Axios class is used as a context manager, suggesting proper resource handling. No input reading beyond optional configuration is present. No untrusted data flows or external data handling are evident. The code structure aligns with typical dependency injection patterns, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard FastAPI dependency setup for the Axios HTTP client. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or security risks. The implementation is straightforward, with no anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
