{
  "purpose": "Provide a FastAPI dependency for managing Axios client instances with optional configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads optional AxiosRequestConfig input in constructor and get_axios function.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write or transmit data, but Axios instances may be used for HTTP requests.",
  "flows": "The dependency creation flows from get_axios() to AxiosDependency(), which then creates Axios instances using provided config.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code constructs are present. The code uses context management appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dependency class for FastAPI, wrapping Axios client creation with async context management. It accepts optional configuration input, but does not process or sanitize it beyond passing to Axios. No input/output data leaks or malicious behaviors are detected. The code appears standard for dependency injection and does not involve any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of a FastAPI dependency for Axios, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for dependency management without any evident security concerns.",
