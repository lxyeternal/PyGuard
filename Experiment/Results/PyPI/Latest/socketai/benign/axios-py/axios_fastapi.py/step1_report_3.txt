{
  "purpose": "Provides a FastAPI dependency wrapper for creating and injecting an Axios client instance.",
  "sources": "The constructor of AxiosDependency and the get_axios function, which accept configuration data.",
  "sinks": "The __call__ method where the Axios client is created and returned; the async context management of Axios.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from the constructor or function parameters into the Axios instance creation, but no untrusted input is explicitly handled or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. No external or untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a FastAPI dependency class that asynchronously creates an Axios client using provided configuration. It relies on standard async context management and dependency injection patterns. No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, and no network communication or data exfiltration is present. The use of optional configuration allows flexibility but does not introduce risk. Overall, it appears to be a simple, clean dependency wrapper with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign FastAPI dependency setup for an Axios client with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
