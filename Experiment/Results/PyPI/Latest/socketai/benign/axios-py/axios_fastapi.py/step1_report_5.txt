  "purpose": "Provide a FastAPI dependency wrapper for Axios HTTP client integration",
  "sources": "Import statements, class constructor, async method, function returning dependency",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data directly; standard dependency injection",
  "flows": "Instantiation of Axios in async context, dependency injection via __call__ and get_axios",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code or backdoors, no obfuscated code, standard patterns used",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dependency class for FastAPI, wrapping an Axios client. It correctly uses async context management to handle Axios lifecycle. The get_axios function provides an instance of this dependency. No external data sources, no untrusted inputs processed insecurely, and no suspicious or malicious code behaviors detected. The code appears straightforward and adheres to typical dependency injection patterns without any signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a FastAPI dependency for an Axios client with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It uses conventional async context management and dependency patterns.",
