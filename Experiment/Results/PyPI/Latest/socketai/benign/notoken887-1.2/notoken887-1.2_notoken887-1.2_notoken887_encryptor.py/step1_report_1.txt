{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods to encrypt and decrypt tokens by substituting certain characters and reversing the string, likely for obfuscation or simple encoding purposes.",
  "sources": "The 'encrypt' method reads the input parameter 'token'. The 'decrypt' method reads the 'encrypted_token' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to send data over network, access files, or interact with system resources in a suspicious manner.",
  "flows": "The 'encrypt' method transforms the input token via character substitution and string reversal, outputting a formatted string. The 'decrypt' method verifies format, reverses the process, and restores the original token.",
  "anomalies": "The code only performs character substitution and reversal; no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or system manipulation detected. The obfuscation appears benign, solely for token encoding.",
  "analysis": "The class defines a simple substitution cipher with a reversal for obfuscation. The 'encrypt' method applies character replacements based on a lookup table and reverses the string, prepending 'ENC#'. The 'decrypt' method checks for the 'ENC#' prefix, strips it, reverses the string back, and applies a reverse lookup to recover the original token. No input/output beyond string manipulation occurs. No malicious code, external calls, or suspicious behavior is present. The only noteworthy aspect is its simplistic obfuscation mechanism, which is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a basic character substitution and string reversal for token encoding and decoding. It contains no malicious behavior, network activity, or security risks. The obfuscation appears benign and intended for simple token transformation.",
