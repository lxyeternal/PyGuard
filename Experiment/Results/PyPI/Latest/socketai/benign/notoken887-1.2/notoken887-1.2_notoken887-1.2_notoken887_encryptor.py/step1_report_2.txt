  "purpose": "The class TokenCryptor provides a simple substitution-based encryption and decryption mechanism for tokens, primarily for obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input tokens for encryption and encrypted tokens for decryption via method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Returns transformed strings; no external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Token input -> encrypt method -> transformed and reversed string -> output; Encrypted token -> decrypt method -> reverse transformation -> original token.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The encryption is basic substitution and reversal, which is insecure for cryptographic purposes but does not constitute malware. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or obfuscation techniques are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple substitution table for certain characters, used in an 'encrypt' method that replaces characters and reverses the string, then prepends 'ENC#'. The 'decrypt' method checks for the prefix, reverses the process using a reverse table, and returns the original token or an error message if format invalid. There are no external data inputs other than method arguments. The logic is straightforward, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The simplicity suggests obfuscation or weak security, but not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements basic token obfuscation without malicious intent. It does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities. It is a simple, non-secure encoding mechanism that could be used for obscuring tokens but not for security. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
