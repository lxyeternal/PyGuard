  "purpose": "The class provides a simple reversible transformation (encryption and decryption) of tokens using character replacement and string reversal.",
  "sources": "The input to the encrypt and decrypt methods: token parameter for encrypt; encrypted_token parameter for decrypt.",
  "sinks": "The return values of encrypt and decrypt methods, which output transformed strings.",
  "flows": "encrypt() takes a token, transforms characters, reverses string, and prepends 'ENC#'; decrypt() verifies format, reverses string, and maps characters back to original.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no network activity, no obfuscation, no suspicious variable naming. The code performs simple character substitution and reversal, which is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward substitution cipher with reversible string reversal. The encrypt method replaces specific characters with symbols, reverses the string, and adds a prefix. The decrypt method verifies the format, reverses back, and restores original characters using a reversed lookup. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The transformations are simple and self-contained, serving a basic obfuscation purpose rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple reversible obfuscation utility without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform harmful operations or data leaks. The overall security risk is very low, and it appears to serve basic token obfuscation or encoding purposes.",
