{
  "purpose": "Provides reversible token obfuscation using character substitution and string reversal, with a prefix 'ENC#'.",
  "sources": "Reads input token in 'encrypt' method; reads encrypted token in 'decrypt' method; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Outputs transformed tokens; verifies prefix in 'decrypt' method; no external sinks or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input token -> substitution + reversal -> 'ENC#' prefix -> output; encrypted token -> prefix check -> reversal + reverse substitution -> original token.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward substitution and reversal with no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple reversible obfuscation using a static substitution table and string reversal, adding a prefix 'ENC#'. The 'encrypt' method applies substitution, reverses the string, and prepends the prefix. The 'decrypt' method verifies the prefix, reverses the string, and applies reverse substitution. No external system calls, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The logic is correct and consistent across reports. The obfuscation is superficial, not cryptographically secure, but not malicious. No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are evident. The malware score is appropriately 0, as there is no malicious intent. The security risk score is low (~0.1), justified by the benign nature and lack of external interactions. The code's purpose is purely for token obfuscation, not security. Overall, the code is a benign utility with minimal security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, reversible obfuscation utility with no malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate, reflecting its benign and superficial obfuscation nature.",
