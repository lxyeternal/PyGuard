  "purpose": "A simple reversible token encryption and decryption utility using character substitution and reversal.",
  "sources": "Input tokens provided to encrypt() and decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "Return statements producing encrypted or decrypted tokens; no external data sinks or network operations observed.",
  "flows": "encrypt() transforms the input token, reverses it, and prepends 'ENC#'; decrypt() verifies the prefix, reverses the string, and applies substitution reversal to recover original token.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual or suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no external data or network operations present. The methods perform simple character transformations.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a straightforward substitution cipher with reversal. The encrypt method replaces specific characters, reverses the string, and adds a prefix. The decrypt method checks for the prefix, reverses the string back, and replaces characters to recover the original token. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The code appears to be a benign encoding utility without any security risks or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple reversible token transformer with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is a benign utility for encoding and decoding tokens without external effects or suspicious behaviors.",
