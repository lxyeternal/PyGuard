{
  "purpose": "A simple class for encrypting and decrypting tokens using character substitution and reversal.",
  "sources": "Input tokens to encrypt or decrypt, specifically the 'token' and 'encrypted_token' parameters in methods.",
  "sinks": "The output of encrypt and decrypt functions; no data is sent over the network or stored.",
  "flows": "Token input -> substitution -> reversal -> output; Encrypted token input -> reversal -> substitution -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; the encryption is basic character substitution with no external data access; the method only transforms strings.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward character substitution cipher with a reversal of the transformed string for encryption and reverses the process for decryption. It does not interact with external systems, read or write files, or perform network communication. The design appears to be a simple obfuscation technique, not cryptographically secure. No malicious behavior such as data theft, code injection, or system access is evident. There are no suspicious or unusual constructs; the logic is clear and isolated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple obfuscation tool with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or access external resources. The design is basic and likely intended for simple token encoding, not secure encryption.",
