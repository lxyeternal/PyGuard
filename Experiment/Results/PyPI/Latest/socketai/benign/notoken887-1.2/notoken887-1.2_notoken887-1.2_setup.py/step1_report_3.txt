  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'notoken887' Python library, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; standard package setup flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of suspicious author email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org'), which are unprofessional and potentially malicious or provocative. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration using setuptools. No external input reading, no data sinks, and no suspicious code constructs. The only notable anomalies are the choice of author email and URL, which appear unprofessional and could be considered malicious or provocative. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is evident. The script is standard for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup file with suspicious metadata details that could be considered unprofessional or malicious in intent. No malicious behavior detected within the code itself. The security risk is minimal, but the unprofessional contact info warrants caution from users.",
