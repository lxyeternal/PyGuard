  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging details for the 'notoken887' Python library.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() function (name, version, author, description, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a provocative email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org') that may suggest malicious intent or attempt to appear controversial; no technical anomalies or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools, with all parameters statically defined. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious code injection is present. The author email and URL are suspicious but do not constitute technical malicious behavior. The code appears solely for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a typical package configuration file with potentially provocative metadata. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware, but the use of controversial contact details could be intended to mislead or cause reputational concerns.",
