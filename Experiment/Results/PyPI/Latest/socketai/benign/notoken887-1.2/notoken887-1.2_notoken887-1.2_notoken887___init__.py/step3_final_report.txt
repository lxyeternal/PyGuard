  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing provided code reports for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "No code provided; analysis based on report descriptions and observed patterns.",
  "sinks": "Network activity, dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, data leaks, hardcoded secrets.",
  "flows": "Suspicious patterns such as eval/exec or network calls indicate potential malicious flow; absence of code prevents definitive source-to-sink mapping.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious traits in report 3: dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscation potential; other reports lack code or anomalies.",
  "analysis": "Reports without code appropriately assign low malware and obfuscation scores with low risk and confidence. Report 3 exhibits suspicious features; scores of 0.3 malware and 0.4 obfuscated are justified but can be slightly increased to 0.4 for better reflection of suspicion. Security risk at 0.55 aligns with the features. Other reports are consistent with their descriptions. Overall, scores are reasonable, with a minor adjustment recommended for report 3.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their findings; report 3's suspicion warrants a slight increase in malware and obfuscation scores to better capture the observed patterns. Overall, the security assessment remains low to moderate, with no confirmed malicious payloads but some patterns warranting caution.",
