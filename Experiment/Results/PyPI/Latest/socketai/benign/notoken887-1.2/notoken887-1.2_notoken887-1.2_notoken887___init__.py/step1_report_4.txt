  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or network communication, but without seeing the actual code, this cannot be confirmed.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include input functions (e.g., input(), sys.stdin, environment variables), data reads from files, network connections, or third-party libraries that load external data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmission functions, subprocess calls, file writing, or data exfiltration points such as email or remote server connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks via variables, functions, or method calls that process or transmit data, potentially leading to malicious actions if untrusted data is involved.",
  "anomalies": "No specific anomalies can be identified without the code. Watch for hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual imports.",
  "analysis": "The review process cannot proceed without actual code content. Typically, one would check for suspicious imports, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, and data handling patterns. Potential malicious behavior includes network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution. No such behaviors can be confirmed without the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of provided code, no definitive malicious activity or security issues can be identified. The code review cannot be completed without analyzing the actual source code.",
