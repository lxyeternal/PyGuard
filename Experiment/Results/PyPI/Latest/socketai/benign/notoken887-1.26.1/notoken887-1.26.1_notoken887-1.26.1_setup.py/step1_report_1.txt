  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'notoken887' Python library.",
  "sources": "No external input or data read; static configuration for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a suspicious email 'hitler@gmail.com' as author contact; the package description references 'obfuscation test lib' which might suggest testing or obfuscation, but no malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The setup script is straightforward, configuring package metadata without executing any code beyond importing 'setuptools' and calling setup(). No code injection, environment variable use, or dynamic code execution is present. The author email is suspicious and unprofessional, possibly indicating malicious intent or an attempt at obfuscation or misdirection. The package description mentions 'obfuscation test lib' but provides no code that performs obfuscation. Overall, the script itself appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with suspicious author contact information but no malicious code or security risks identified. It appears to be a benign package configuration with no evidence of malware or supply chain attacks.",
