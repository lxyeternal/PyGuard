  "purpose": "Define package metadata and configuration for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static strings within the setup() call: name, version, packages, author, author_email, description, long_description, url, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "N/A - No untrusted data handling or external data sources; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author_email ('hitler@gmail.com') and url ('https://thugging.org'); no code obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static setup script for a Python package, with no dynamic code, code injection, or obfuscation. The only notable anomalies are the unprofessional contact details, which could be used for malicious purposes if the package were maliciously distributed. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected within this code snippet. The metadata concerns do not constitute technical security threats but are worth noting for social engineering or reputation risks.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and contains no malicious code or obfuscation. The primary concern is the suspicious contact information, which could be exploited socially but does not reflect technical malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting metadata suspicion rather than code-based threats.",
