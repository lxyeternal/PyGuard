  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and contains no malicious code or obfuscation. The primary concern is the suspicious contact information, which could be exploited socially but does not reflect technical malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting metadata suspicion rather than code-based threats."
