  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in its current form, performing simple character substitution. The main red flag is the call to RRUU() and the import from an obscure module, which could be used for malicious purposes if RRUU() performs harmful actions. Given the lack of evidence for malicious activity, the overall malware risk is low but not negligible. Further investigation into RRUU() is recommended."
