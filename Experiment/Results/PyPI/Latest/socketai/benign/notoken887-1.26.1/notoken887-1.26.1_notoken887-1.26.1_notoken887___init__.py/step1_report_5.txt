{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple utility for handling user input and possibly performing some basic data processing or display.",
  "sources": "User input via functions such as input() or reading environment variables, or external data files.",
  "sinks": "Print statements, file writes, or network calls (if any are present).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input or external data) to sinks (output or storage points).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual functions are observed. No external network connections or data exfiltration methods are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with standard Python constructs. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. No obfuscation, suspicious imports, or unsafe code patterns are detected. The code lacks complex dynamic execution or hidden behaviors. The absence of network calls or credential handling further reduces risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions as a basic utility script with no evident supply chain security issues.",
