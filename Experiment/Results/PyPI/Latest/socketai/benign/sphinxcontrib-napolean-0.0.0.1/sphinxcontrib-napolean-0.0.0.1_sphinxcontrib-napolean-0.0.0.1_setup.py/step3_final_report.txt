  "purpose": "Define static package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters: name, version, author, author_email, description, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual version string '0.0.0.1' and empty author/email fields; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard static setup script with no dynamic behavior, input handling, or suspicious patterns. Multiple reviews confirm its benign nature, noting the placeholder purpose and lack of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The version number and empty author fields are unconventional but not harmful. All scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The current assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
