{
  "purpose": "The code implements a character substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings, primarily serving as a simple obfuscation or encoding mechanism.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to the encrypt and decrypt methods, which are then processed through extensive chained replace calls.",
  "sinks": "The methods output transformed strings; no external data sinks or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed into encrypt/decrypt, which then replace characters with corresponding symbols and vice versa, forming a reversible source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a lengthy chain of replace calls, which can be considered a form of superficial obfuscation; no malicious or suspicious code patterns are present. Minor inconsistency with a composite emoji for 'T' is symmetrical and does not imply malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static, symmetrical character replacements for encoding and decoding. It does not involve external dependencies, network activity, or dynamic evaluation. The extensive replace chains serve as superficial obfuscation but do not introduce malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The symmetry between encrypt and decrypt confirms straightforward reversible substitution. The high number of replacements increases the obfuscation score but remains benign. No security vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static substitution cipher used for obfuscation or encoding purposes. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The extensive replacement mappings are superficial and serve only to obscure the original string, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
