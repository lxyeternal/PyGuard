{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple character replacement-based encoding and decoding functions, ostensibly for token obfuscation or lightweight encryption.",
  "sources": "Input data is passed to the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods as string parameters.",
  "sinks": "The methods perform in-place string replacements; no external data sinks or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Input string -> 'encrypt' (replacements) -> Obfuscated string; Obfuscated string -> 'decrypt' (replacements) -> Original string.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward, reversible character substitutions without any complex cryptographic mechanisms. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are evident. The use of emoji and special characters is purely for character mapping; no external calls, environment variables, or file I/O observed. No obfuscation or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple substitution cipher with a large static mapping between characters and emoji or special characters. The 'encrypt' method replaces standard characters with emojis, and 'decrypt' reverses this mapping. There are no external dependencies, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The implementation is straightforward and appears to serve basic obfuscation purposes only, not secure encryption. No anomalies or suspicious code flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a basic reversible substitution cipher using emoji characters. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It does not perform any harmful actions, data leaks, or unauthorized system access. Its purpose seems to be simple obfuscation rather than security or malicious activity.",
