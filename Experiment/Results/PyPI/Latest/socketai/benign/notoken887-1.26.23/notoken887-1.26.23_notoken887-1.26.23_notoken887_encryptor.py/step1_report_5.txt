{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple substitution cipher-based encoding and decoding of strings using emoji and special characters.",
  "sources": "The methods read input strings to encrypt or decrypt by replacing characters with emojis or other symbols.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data sinks; the code only performs character replacements within the input strings.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through sequential character replacements in 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods, transforming characters back and forth.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a very basic substitution cipher with hardcoded replacement mappings. There are no dynamic inputs, no network access, or obfuscated code. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a simple substitution cipher, replacing characters with emojis and symbols in a fixed manner. No external dependencies, no data leaks, no network activity, no backdoors, and no malicious payloads are present. The logic is straightforward, with static mappings. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident. It appears to be intended for playful encoding rather than security purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a character substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. Its simplicity and static mappings pose no threat, though it offers minimal security. Overall, the code is benign.",
