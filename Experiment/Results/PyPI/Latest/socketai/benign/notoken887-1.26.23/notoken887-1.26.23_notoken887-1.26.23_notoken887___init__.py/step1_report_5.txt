  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script performing data processing or utility functions, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from command line arguments, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Data is output to console, files, or network endpoints; potential data leaks could occur if untrusted data is sent over the network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (arguments, environment variables) to processing functions and then to output sinks such as print statements, files, or network transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are detected. No backdoors, code injection, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing common Python features, and does not include dynamic code execution or obfuscation. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or cryptomining are observed. The structure indicates typical utility functionality with proper data handling.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign script with no suspicious or harmful elements.",
