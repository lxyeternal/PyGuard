  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code input, dynamic code execution points, network communication functions, environment variable access, data handling routines.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, file write/read operations, environment variable access, eval or exec calls, database queries.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input data or environment variables flow into code execution points or network functions, potentially leading to data exfiltration or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated strings, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), encoded data, suspicious network patterns, inconsistent or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The reports generally indicate that most code is benign, with scores reflecting low suspicion. Report 3 stands out with higher obfuscation (0.7) and moderate malware suspicion (0.4), justified by the mention of obfuscation and dynamic code features. Other reports correctly assign zero or minimal scores, consistent with their descriptions. The confidence levels align with the evidence provided. No significant anomalies or suspicious patterns are confirmed beyond the suspicion in Report 3. Overall, the scoring is appropriate and consistent with the analyses.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears safe with low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 3's suspicion is justified, warranting moderate concern. The overall assessment indicates low risk, with no definitive malicious activity detected. Scores are well-aligned with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary.",
