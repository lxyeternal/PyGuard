{
  "purpose": "Helper functions for setting up environment, shared memory management, logging configuration, and argument parsing for a larger data processing or calibration application.",
  "sources": "Reads command line arguments via argparse; accesses shared memory segments; logs messages to stdout.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes untrusted data or performs dangerous actions. No insecure data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Command line arguments influence logging and configuration; shared memory functions create, load, or close shared memory segments; logging outputs formatted messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or unusual constructs. The code performs standard setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions for shared memory management, logging setup with colored output, and command line argument parsing. It utilizes standard Python libraries and third-party modules without suspicious modifications. The shared memory functions use the multiprocessing.shared_memory module correctly. Logging formatter customizes message styles. Argument parsing includes options for dataset management and calibration thresholds. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The code appears to be a typical utility setup for a data science or machine learning pipeline.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for environment setup and configuration, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as expected for its purpose.",
