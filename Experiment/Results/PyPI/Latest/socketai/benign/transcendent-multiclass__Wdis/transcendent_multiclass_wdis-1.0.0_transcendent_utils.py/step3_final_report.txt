  "purpose": "Utility functions for environment setup, shared memory management, logging configuration, and command-line argument parsing.",
  "sources": "Reading input data for shared memory allocation, command-line arguments, environment variables (if any), and logging setup.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal data flows involve shared memory buffers and logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., numpy arrays, command-line args) are processed within functions; no external network or file writes are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of shared memory and argument parsing is standard but could be misused if inputs are malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions for shared memory management, logging, and argument parsing. No network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious code are present. The malware score is 0, as there are no malicious behaviors. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward. The security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal potential misuse of shared memory or argument inputs, but no active vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.95-1), given the code's simplicity and standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as infrastructure for multiprocessing, logging, and configuration. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are present. The slight security risk score accounts for potential misconfiguration but does not indicate actual threats.",
