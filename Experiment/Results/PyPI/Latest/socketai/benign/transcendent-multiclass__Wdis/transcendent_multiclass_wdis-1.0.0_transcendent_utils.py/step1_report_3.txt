{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for environment setup, shared memory management, logging configuration, and command-line argument parsing for a data processing or machine learning pipeline.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration arguments from command line, imports system and external libraries, reads shared memory by name, accesses environment variables indirectly via logging or argparse.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is written or executed; no network connections, file writes, or command executions are present.",
  "flows": "Input from command line args flows into configuration variables; shared memory functions access system resources by name; logging outputs formatted messages to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears standard for utility functions with no suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, no unusual dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and external libraries and defines functions for shared memory management, logging setup, and argument parsing. These functions perform expected tasks without performing any actions that could be malicious, such as executing system commands, network activity, or data exfiltration. The argument parser allows configuration but does not execute code based on untrusted input. The logging configuration customizes output formatting with color but does not pose security risks. No anomalies or signs of malicious behavior are evident in the functions or their usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for environment setup, logging, and argument parsing, with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors detected. It appears safe and benign in the context of supply chain security.",
