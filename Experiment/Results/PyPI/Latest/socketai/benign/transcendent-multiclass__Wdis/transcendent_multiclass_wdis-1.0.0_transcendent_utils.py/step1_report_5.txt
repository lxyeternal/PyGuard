{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for environment setup, shared memory management, logging configuration, and argument parsing for a larger data processing application.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (via argparse), sys.stdout for logging, and shared memory segments for multiprocessing.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "User input from command-line arguments influences program behavior; shared memory functions read and write to shared buffers; logging functions output colored logs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code uses standard libraries and well-understood patterns. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines utility functions for shared memory allocation and cleanup, custom logging formatting, and argument parsing. The shared memory functions handle creation, loading, closing, and unlinking shared buffers. The logging setup uses colored output for different levels, which is benign. Argument parsing captures multiple configuration options related to datasets, thresholds, and calibration parameters, including numeric conversions and validation. All functions use standard, documented libraries without suspicious behavior. No signs of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side effects are present. The code appears to serve as supportive infrastructure for a larger analysis pipeline without any malicious intent or harmful activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for environment setup, logging, and argument parsing, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
