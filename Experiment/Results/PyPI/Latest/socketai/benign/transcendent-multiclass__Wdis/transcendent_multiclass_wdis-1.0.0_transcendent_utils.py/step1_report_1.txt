{
  "purpose": "The script provides utility functions for environment setup, shared memory management, logging configuration, and command-line argument parsing for a larger data processing or machine learning pipeline.",
  "sources": "Input data from shared memory functions, command-line arguments via argparse, and environment variables for logging.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; no network, file, or sensitive data leakage points identified.",
  "flows": "Data is read from shared memory or command-line args, processed internally, and configurations are logged; no external or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code appears to be standard utility setup with no malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for shared memory management using multiprocessing, a custom logging formatter with colored output, and command-line argument parsing for data processing pipeline configuration. No external data inputs, network operations, or credential handling are present. The code employs standard libraries and practices, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior. The functions are straightforward, focusing on environment setup and configuration, which are typical for such utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be a legitimate utility module for a larger project. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. Overall, it is safe based on the provided content.",
