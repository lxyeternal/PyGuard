  "purpose": "The code provides functions for evaluating and tuning thresholds for classification models, specifically focusing on conformal evaluation, rejection-based performance analysis, and threshold search methods.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function arguments, including scores, predicted labels, groundtruth labels, and threshold parameters. No external data sources or user inputs are directly read within the code.",
  "sinks": "Results are returned as dictionaries; no explicit data sinks or network communication is present. There are no apparent sinks that handle untrusted data in a dangerous way, nor do functions send data over the network or write to files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments into functions like 'apply_threshold', 'test_with_rejection', and 'get_performance_with_rejection'. Thresholds are generated or sampled, then applied to scores and labels to produce evaluation metrics. These metrics guide threshold search processes.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are detected. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward control flows. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or misleading variables are present. Use of multiprocessing for threshold searches is typical for performance but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements multiple threshold tuning algorithms including random search, full exhaustive search, and constrained search, all aimed at optimizing classification metrics under constraints. It includes parallel processing for efficiency. The code relies on numpy, scikit-learn metrics, and standard Python modules, with no signs of malicious intent or data exfiltration. Functions generate thresholds, evaluate model performance, and produce reports, all in a transparent manner. There are no network operations, file writes, or external system modifications. The 'get_performance_with_rejection' function computes metrics and confusion matrices, which are standard for evaluation. Use of multiprocessing for parameter search is common in model tuning. No obfuscated or suspicious code segments are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of threshold optimization and evaluation routines for classification models. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It primarily facilitates model evaluation and tuning, with standard security and coding practices. No signs of malicious activity or malicious intent are evident.",
