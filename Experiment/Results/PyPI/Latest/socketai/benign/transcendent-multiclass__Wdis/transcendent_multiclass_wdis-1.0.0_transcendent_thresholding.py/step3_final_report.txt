{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for applying thresholds to classification scores, evaluating performance with rejection options, and searching for optimal thresholds via random or exhaustive methods. It is used for model calibration and performance assessment in classification tasks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters include test scores, predicted labels, groundtruth labels, and threshold configurations; no external untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "Results are returned as data structures; no network communication, file modifications, or system commands are executed; only logging is used for reporting.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input scores and labels through threshold application functions to performance evaluation, and finally to reporting functions; no external untrusted data influences control flow or system state.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are present. Use of 'os.urandom' for seeding numpy's RNG is standard for cryptographically secure randomness, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard thresholding, evaluation, and parameter search routines typical in machine learning model calibration. It uses common libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious behavior. The use of multiprocessing and 'os.urandom' for seed initialization are benign and standard. No external communication, code obfuscation, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of threshold-based evaluation routines. No malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks are evident. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is very low (~0.2), consistent with the code's benign nature.",
