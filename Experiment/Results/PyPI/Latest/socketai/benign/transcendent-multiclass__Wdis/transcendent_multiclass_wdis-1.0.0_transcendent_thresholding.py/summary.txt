  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of threshold-based evaluation routines. No malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks are evident. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is very low (~0.2), consistent with the code's benign nature."
