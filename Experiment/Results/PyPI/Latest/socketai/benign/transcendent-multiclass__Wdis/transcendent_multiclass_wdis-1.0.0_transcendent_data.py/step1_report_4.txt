{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for loading, caching, and saving data and results during conformal evaluation in a cybersecurity or machine learning pipeline.",
  "sources": "File reads for loading pickled data files, input parameters for file paths and configurations.",
  "sinks": "File writes for saving cached models and results, reading data from pickle files.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from pickle files into memory (load_csr_list, load_cached_data), possibly modified in memory, then cached or saved to disk (cache_data, save_results).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated code detected. Use of pickle for data serialization is noted, but common for this context. No dynamic code execution or network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for loading sparse matrix features and associated labels, caching models and data, and saving results in different formats. The functions use standard libraries such as pickle, numpy, scipy, and json, with appropriate input/output handling. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident; pickle is used solely for loading/saving data and models, typical in ML workflows. The code lacks network operations, system modifications, or hidden behaviors. No anomalies or indicators of malicious intent are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code performs standard data management tasks for a machine learning pipeline related to cybersecurity evaluation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and typical for its intended purpose.",
