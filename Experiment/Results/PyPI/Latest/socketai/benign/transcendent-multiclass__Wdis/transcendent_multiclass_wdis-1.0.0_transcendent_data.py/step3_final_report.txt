  "purpose": "Utility functions for loading, caching, and saving data and models in a machine learning or cybersecurity pipeline.",
  "sources": "File I/O operations reading pickle files, environment variables, and directory checks.",
  "sinks": "Writing pickle files, saving results in text, JSON, or pickle formats.",
  "flows": "Loading data from pickle files into sparse matrices; saving models and results to disk.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle for serialization, which can be risky if files are untrusted; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data management tasks with proper directory handling and logging. No network activity or malicious logic is present. The use of pickle is typical but warrants caution if files are untrusted. No obfuscation or backdoors are evident. The security risks are minimal and align with the low malware score. The code's purpose is legitimate, and the signals do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility module for data and model management, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The use of pickle introduces a known security risk if used with untrusted files, but in controlled environments, this is acceptable. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2).",
