  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility module for data and model management, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The use of pickle introduces a known security risk if used with untrusted files, but in controlled environments, this is acceptable. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2)."
