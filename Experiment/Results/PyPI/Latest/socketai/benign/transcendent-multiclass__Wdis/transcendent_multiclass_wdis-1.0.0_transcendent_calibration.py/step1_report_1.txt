{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for partitioning datasets, training classifiers (specifically Random Forest), and computing calibration metrics for machine learning models, mainly for model calibration and evaluation tasks.",
  "sources": "Data reading occurs in data.load_cached_data(), data.cache_data(), and data files accessed via os.path.exists(). Inputs also come from X_train, y_train, X_proper_train, y_proper_train, X_cal, y_cal, which are training and calibration datasets.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted data is loaded via load_cached_data() without validation. Network or system calls are not present. Model objects are saved and loaded locally, with no external network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from datasets into model training, calibration metrics computation, and cache operations. Results from model predictions and scores are stored locally and used for further computations. No external data transmissions are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code contains commented-out code that references SVM models, but it's inactive. No obfuscated or intentionally misleading code structures are observed. Cache file checks prevent re-computation, which is normal. No suspicious file access beyond typical model caching.",
  "analysis": "The code loads datasets, trains Random Forest classifiers, and computes calibration scores and p-values. It uses multiprocessing for parallel fold training, which is standard. Cache checks prevent redundant computations. All file operations are local, with no network connections. There is no evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious control flows. The code appears to be a typical implementation for model calibration with no suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate calibration training and evaluation tasks with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to standard practices in model evaluation workflows and does not exhibit signs of supply chain sabotage or malware.",
