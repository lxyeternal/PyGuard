{
  "purpose": "The code handles dataset partitioning, model training using Random Forest classifiers, and calibration score computation for model thresholds. It facilitates cross-validation, caching of models and results, and parallel processing to optimize calibration workflows.",
  "sources": "Data is loaded via 'load_cached_data()' from local cache files; features and labels are input parameters; no external data sources or network activity are present.",
  "sinks": "Results such as models, calibration metrics, and p-values are cached locally using 'cache_data()'; no external network communication or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "flows": "Input datasets are split into training and calibration folds; models are trained and cached; calibration scores and p-values are computed and stored; data flows from input arrays through model training, prediction, and caching steps.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors are detected. Cache file naming conventions are predictable but standard. Commented-out code (e.g., SVM) is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard calibration pipeline for machine learning models, utilizing local caching for efficiency, multiprocessing for parallelism, and cross-validation for robustness. No external network activity or malicious code patterns are present. Cache files are used for storing models and results, which could be manipulated if compromised, but this is typical in ML workflows. The functions perform dataset splitting, model training, calibration metric calculation, and result aggregation in a straightforward manner. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of calibration procedures in ML workflows, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The use of cache files introduces minimal security considerations, but these are standard and not indicative of malicious intent.",
