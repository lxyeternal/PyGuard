{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract class for a classifier with commented-out calibration and p-value functions, serving as a base or template for machine learning models.",
  "sources": "Class definition and abstract method 'ncm'; no active data input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No active data flow; the code is purely structural with commented-out functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of extensive commented-out code related to calibration and p-value calculations; no active malicious or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward abstract base class with an abstract method 'ncm'. All other functions are commented out, indicating either incomplete implementation or placeholders. There are no active data processing, network, or system modification operations. The commented functions are typical in ML frameworks and do not suggest malicious intent. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present. The code's benign nature is supported by the absence of active external interactions or suspicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard abstract class template for machine learning classifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The commented-out code does not pose a security risk as it is inactive. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score is 0.",
