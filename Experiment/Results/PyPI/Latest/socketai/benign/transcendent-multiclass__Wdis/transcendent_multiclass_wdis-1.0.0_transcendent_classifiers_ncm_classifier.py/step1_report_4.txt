{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for a Nearest Classifier Model (NCM) with commented-out methods for p-value calculation and calibration, intended for subclass implementation.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources or input reading in active code; commented methods suggest input data via parameters X, y, X_cal, y_cal, X_ref, y_ref.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows present in active code. Commented methods involve data processing but do not perform external communication.",
  "flows": "No active data flows; commented code indicates typical flow of data through prediction and calibration functions, but not executed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; all code is straightforward and uses standard Python features. The commented sections are typical for a machine learning class and do not contain suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with one abstract method 'ncm'. The other methods are commented out and contain standard operations for classifier calibration and p-value computation, which are common in statistical models. No malicious behavior, hidden code, or suspicious operations are evident. The structure and syntax are normal, and there are no indications of code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a typical abstract class setup for a machine learning classifier.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign abstract class definition with commented-out methods for calibration and p-value calculation. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
