{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract class for a Nearest Classifier Model (NCM) with a placeholder for the ncm method implementation.",
  "sources": "The class itself, especially the abstract method 'ncm' which is intended to be implemented in subclasses.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or sensitive information in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The commented-out methods suggest data flows involving prediction and calibration steps, but these are not active in this code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of extensive commented-out code which could indicate obfuscation or unfinished implementation, but no active malicious code or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines an abstract class with an abstract method 'ncm'. The comments hint at intended functionality for p-value computation and calibration, but all related code is commented out. No data input or output operations are present, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The commented code could have been removed for security reasons or left incomplete, but in its current state, it poses no threat.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, commented-out abstract class definition with no active malicious behavior or suspicious elements. It does not perform any data processing or external communications, thus presenting a very low security risk.",
