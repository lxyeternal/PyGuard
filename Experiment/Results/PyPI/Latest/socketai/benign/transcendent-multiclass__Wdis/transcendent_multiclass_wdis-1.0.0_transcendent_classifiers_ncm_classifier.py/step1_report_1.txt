{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for a classifier that includes methods related to computing non-conformity measures (NCM) and calibration procedures (commented out).",
  "sources": "No active data input sources; commented-out functions contain input data references, but are not executed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; no code interacts with untrusted data or external systems.",
  "flows": "No active data flow; all functional code is either commented out or abstract.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of commented-out functions that suggest potential for calibration logic but no active malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with an abstract method 'ncm', intended for subclasses to implement. The commented-out methods relate to p-value computation and calibration procedures, which are typical in conformal prediction frameworks. There is no active code performing network operations, file handling, or system modifications. The code structure appears standard for a machine learning class setup. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward abstract class for a classifier with placeholder methods and commented-out calibration logic. It does not contain malicious code or security risks. The code's intent appears to be legitimate for ML classifier design, with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities detected.",
