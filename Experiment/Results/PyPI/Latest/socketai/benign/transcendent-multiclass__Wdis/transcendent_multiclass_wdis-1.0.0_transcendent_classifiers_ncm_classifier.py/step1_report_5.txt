{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract class for a Nearest Classifier Model (NCM) with placeholder methods for classification and calibration processes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines a class and commented-out methods.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or outputs that could leak untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No active data flows; the code contains only method signatures and comments.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains commented-out code that suggests additional functionality but does not perform any active or potentially malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'NCMClassifier' with an abstract method 'ncm'. The comments include functions for p-value computation and calibration, but these are commented out and not executable. There are no network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The code appears to be a template or base class for machine learning models, with no active malicious behavior or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward abstract class definition intended for classification purposes. It does not contain any malicious code or security risks. The presence of commented-out functions is common in development or illustrative code and does not imply malicious intent.",
