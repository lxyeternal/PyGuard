{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for a Nearest Class Mean (NCM) classifier, including commented-out methods for calibration and p-value calculation.",
  "sources": "Imports 'abstractmethod' and 'ABC' from the 'abc' module; class definition; abstract method 'ncm'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input/output or external communications present in the code.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code suggests planned or previous functionality for statistical calibration, but no active code performs input/output, network, or system modification.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with an abstract method 'ncm' and contains commented-out methods related to statistical calculations and calibration. There are no active data input/output, no network operations, no file manipulations, or code execution beyond standard class definition. The commented code does not execute or pose risks. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard abstract class definition with no malicious behavior or security risks. The commented-out sections do not introduce active malicious actions. Overall, the code appears benign.",
