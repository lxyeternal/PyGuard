{
  "purpose": "This code implements functions for computing conformal scores, non-conformity measures, credibility, and confidence p-values for binary classification tasks, particularly with SVM and Random Forest classifiers, to evaluate model reliability and calibration.",
  "sources": "Reads include data input via arguments (X_in, y_in, train_ncms, groundtruth_train, test_ncms, y_test, X_test), model attributes (decision_function, predict_proba), and shared memory segments (load_existing_shm).",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive outputs include computed scores, probabilities, and p-values returned by functions; no data leaks or external communications are evident. No sinks that transmit untrusted data externally are present.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from arguments or shared memory; processed by classifier methods (decision_function, predict_proba); scores and p-values are computed; and results are returned or stored locally. No external data flow or network communication is present.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains functions for shared memory allocation and multiprocessing, which is standard for performance but warrants caution. No signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code structure appears normal and focused on statistical computations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs statistical evaluations for conformal prediction, utilizing classifier methods and shared memory for efficiency. It computes non-conformity measures, credibility, and confidence scores, and uses multiprocessing to parallelize calculations. No code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious logic is detected. All operations are within normal bounds for a model evaluation library.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a legitimate implementation of conformal prediction scoring functions without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It focuses on statistical computations related to classifier calibration and evaluation. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or harmful data exfiltration is observed.",
