{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions for calculating non-conformity scores, p-values, and probabilities related to conformal evaluation in a binary classification setting, primarily for use with SVM and Random Forest classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input arrays, classifier decision functions, and shared memory segments; loads existing shared memory objects for NCMS, ground truth, and test data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially exposes data through shared memory, but primarily for internal use; no direct data exfiltration, network activity, or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Loads shared memory data -> Computes NCMS and p-values -> Uses multiprocessing pools for parallel calculations -> Outputs scores and p-values.",
  "anomalies": "Use of shared memory for data exchange, which could be exploited if misused; extensive use of multiprocessing with shared memory suggests performance optimization but warrants scrutiny. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or backdoors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs statistical computations for conformal prediction metrics using classifiers, with no external network communication, system modification, or data exfiltration. Shared memory is used for efficient data handling across processes. The functions involve standard machine learning practices, including calculation of non-conformity scores, credibility, and confidence scores. No signs of malicious behavior such as hidden backdoors, data theft, or cryptomining are evident. The code relies on external libraries like numpy, pandas, tqdm, and standard multiprocessing, which are typical for such tasks. The only minor concern is the use of shared memory, which requires careful handling to prevent potential data leakage if improperly used in a broader context. However, within this isolated code, it appears intended for internal, performance-oriented data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of conformal evaluation functions for binary classifiers, with no malicious behavior or sabotage detected. The use of shared memory and multiprocessing is typical for performance optimization but should be reviewed in deployment for proper security controls.",
