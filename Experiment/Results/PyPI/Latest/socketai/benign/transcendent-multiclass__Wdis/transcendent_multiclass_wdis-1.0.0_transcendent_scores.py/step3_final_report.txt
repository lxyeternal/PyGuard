{
  "purpose": "The code implements functions for conformal evaluation, including non-conformity measures, credibility, and confidence scores for binary classifiers (SVM, RF). It processes data via shared memory and multiprocessing for performance optimization.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, shared memory segments for training and test NCMS, and classifier outputs.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network communication, or system modifications are present; data flows are confined within in-memory computations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from classifier functions to shared memory, then through multiprocessing pools to compute p-values and scores, returning in-memory data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious patterns detected. Use of shared memory and multiprocessing is standard for performance, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard conformal evaluation procedures with appropriate use of shared memory and multiprocessing. No signs of malicious activity such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior. The security risk score is low (0.2), justified by the complexity of shared memory management but not indicative of vulnerability. The code is clear, purpose-driven, and aligns with best practices for ML evaluation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, purpose-specific, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
