  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and data flow anomalies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, external data sources, standard input/output, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variables, system commands, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks involving environment variables, user inputs, external data, and output functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are either empty, missing, or involve benign data handling such as reading environment variables and processing inputs without malicious intent. No suspicious data flows, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are observed. The absence of code in some reports precludes analysis, but the reasoning and scoring are appropriate. Low security risk scores reflect minimal concern, and malware scores are zero, consistent with the benign descriptions. Confidence levels are moderate to high, aligning with the amount of information provided.",
  "conclusion": "All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity and assign appropriate low malware and obfuscation scores. The security risk scores are justified given the benign nature of the code and limited data flows. No evidence suggests supply chain sabotage or malicious behavior. The assessments are consistent and accurate.",
