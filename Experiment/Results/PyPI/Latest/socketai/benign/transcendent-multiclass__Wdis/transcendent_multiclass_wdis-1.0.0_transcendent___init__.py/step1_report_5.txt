{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a basic Python script performing standard data processing or utility functions, with no obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables and potentially external modules or data files loaded at runtime.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs include print statements, file writes, or network transmissions (if present), but no explicit sinks are identified as malicious.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, then to output or external modules; no suspicious or anomalous source-to-sink paths are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are evident. The code structure appears straightforward without unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard Python with typical usage of libraries and control flow. No code injection, unsafe SQL, or privacy violations are apparent. The absence of suspicious domain connections, data exfiltration, or cryptomining code supports a benign assessment. The code's simplicity and lack of hidden behaviors suggest low risk.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with standard functionality.",
