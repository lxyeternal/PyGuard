{
  "purpose": "Implements a proximity-based Random Forest classifier with parallel processing using shared memory for efficiency.",
  "sources": "Input data (X_train, y_train), shared memory segments loaded via load_existing_shm, and internal function calls.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no external network, file, or command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays to shared memory, then through parallel proximity computations, and into classifier methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected. Shared memory management appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard ML utility with parallel proximity calculations, using shared memory for performance. No malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. External functions are assumed benign. The structure and logic are consistent and correct. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the trustworthiness of shared memory utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a proximity-enhanced Random Forest classifier. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The security risk is low, and the code appears safe for use in production environments assuming external shared memory functions are secure.",
