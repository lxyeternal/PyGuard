{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to perform data processing or utility functions typical in a Python package, but without additional context, the exact purpose cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, local variables, and possibly environment variables or external files (if any are present), but no explicit input sources are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of dynamic code if present; however, the current code does not contain obvious dangerous sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (parameters or environment variables) through internal processing functions towards outputs, logs, or external systems, but no explicit source-to-sink flows are identified in the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code appears clean, with no obfuscated elements, backdoors, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, using standard Python constructs, and there are no signs of malicious behavior. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or code injection is evident. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard. No anomalies such as dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden logic are detected. The code's structure is typical, and no unusual variables or control flows are observed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities evident.",
