{
  "purpose": "Defines enumerations for FFmpeg codecs, formats, filters, and pixel formats to standardize command parameters.",
  "sources": "Static enum class definitions with descriptive comments; no input/output handling or dynamic data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; static definitions without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of TODO comments and incomplete documentation, but no malicious or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static enum classes for FFmpeg parameters, with extensive inline comments. No dynamic code, input handling, or external command execution is present. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The malware score is appropriately zero, and risk scores are minimal, reflecting the benign, static nature of the code. The TODOs are typical development notes and do not impact security. The code's structure and comments suggest it is a utility module for parameter standardization, not executing or processing untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static enumeration module for FFmpeg parameters with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are justified and should remain as is.",
