{
  "purpose": "Defines enumerations for various ffmpeg codecs, formats, filters, and pixel formats to facilitate easier command construction and usage.",
  "sources": "Imports from yta_general_utils.programming.enum, class attribute assignments, inline comments.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from external untrusted sources to sensitive sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures observed. The code mainly consists of enumerations with descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured enum classes for ffmpeg codecs, formats, filters, and pixel formats, with detailed inline documentation and TODO notes. There is no evidence of code injection, data leakage, environment variable misuse, or other security issues. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears to serve as a static configuration or utility module for ffmpeg command generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured set of enumerations serving as constants for ffmpeg-related parameters. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. The presence of TODO comments suggests ongoing development but no malicious or harmful content.",
