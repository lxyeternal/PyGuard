  "purpose": "Define enumerations for various ffmpeg codecs, formats, filters, and pixel formats to facilitate ffmpeg command construction.",
  "sources": "Imports YTAEnum from yta_general_utils.programming.enum",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this is a static enumeration definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. All code consists of enum class definitions and descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions used to standardize ffmpeg parameters such as codecs, formats, filters, and pixel formats. There are no input handling, dynamic code execution, or data manipulation elements. All comments are descriptive, and no suspicious code behaviors or hardcoded secrets are present. The import is from a local utility module, not external or untrusted data. No malicious intent or sabotage mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-documented set of enum classes for ffmpeg configuration options, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility module.",
