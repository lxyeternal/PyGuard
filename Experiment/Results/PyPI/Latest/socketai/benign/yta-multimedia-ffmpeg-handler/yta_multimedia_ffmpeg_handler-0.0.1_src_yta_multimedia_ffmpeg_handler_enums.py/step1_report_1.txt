{
  "purpose": "Defines enumerations for various FFmpeg codecs, formats, filters, and pixel formats to facilitate media processing commands.",
  "sources": "Import statement for YTAEnum from an external utility module; class definitions with string constants representing codecs, formats, filters, and pixel formats.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or untrusted output are present in this code.",
  "flows": "N/A – The code only defines enums without data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. The code appears to be straightforward enumeration definitions with descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a structured set of enumerations for FFmpeg-related parameters, with extensive documentation and no execution of external commands, data input/output, or code injection points. No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, data leakage, or malicious payloads are observed. The only notable aspect is the inclusion of placeholder 'TODO' comments and incomplete documentation, which are benign and common in development environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard enumeration module for media processing configuration and shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a static, descriptive helper module with no active or unsafe operations.",
