  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the issues, reasoning, and scoring, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines enums for FFmpeg codecs, formats, filters, and pixel formats. No active code, data flow, or malicious patterns. Comments include TODOs and incomplete documentation, which are benign.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Notes:** The reasoning is sound; the code is static, well-documented, and benign.\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the static nature, no untrusted data, no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0, obfuscated 0.\n- **Notes:** Correct reasoning; no issues.\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, with emphasis on the absence of dynamic or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0, obfuscated 0.\n- **Notes:** Valid conclusion.\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Also consistent; notes TODO comments but no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.1 (due to TODOs), obfuscated 0.\n- **Justification:** The small risk score reflects potential incomplete code or future development, not maliciousness.\n- **Notes:** The reasoning aligns with the code's static nature.\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with no suspicious behavior, only static enum definitions, comprehensive documentation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0, obfuscated 0.\n- **Notes:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is purely enum definitions with descriptive comments. No active code, data processing, or external interactions. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** All reports correctly identify the static, benign nature. The only minor point is the TODO comments, which are not security issues but indicate ongoing development.\n- **Scores:** All malware scores are appropriately 0, reflecting no malicious activity. Risk scores are correctly set to 0 or very low (0.1) considering the TODOs, which are benign.\n- **Justification for higher risk scores:** None of the reports justify higher scores; the reasoning is sound.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** No unwarranted assumptions are made; the analysis is consistent with the static enum definitions.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate**\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, static, and well-structured.\n\n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risks; only minor TODO comments which are non-security related.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, well-documented utility module for FFmpeg parameter enumeration, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The current scoring and reasoning in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
