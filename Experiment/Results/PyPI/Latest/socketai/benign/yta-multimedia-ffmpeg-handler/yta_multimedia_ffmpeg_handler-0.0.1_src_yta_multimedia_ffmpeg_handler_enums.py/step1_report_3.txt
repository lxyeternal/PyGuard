  "purpose": "Define enumerations for various ffmpeg codecs, formats, filters, and pixel formats to standardize usage in ffmpeg command construction.",
  "sources": "Imports from yta_general_utils.programming.enum, internal enum class definitions, inline docstrings",
  "sinks": "None; code only defines enums and docstrings, no data flow or untrusted input handling observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or untrusted data processing present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions with descriptive docstrings. There are no functions, user input handling, network operations, or external data interactions. The enums serve as constants for ffmpeg options. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward set of enumerations for ffmpeg configuration options, intended for standard use within a larger application. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
