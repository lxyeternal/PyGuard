  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code to ensure consistency, correctness, and security posture.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code consists solely of enum class definitions for FFmpeg codecs, formats, filters, and pixel formats.\n- There are extensive descriptive comments, including URLs for further info.\n- No dynamic code, data input/output, network activity, or command execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The import is from a local utility module, not external or untrusted sources.\n- The TODO comments and incomplete documentation are typical in development and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code is static enum definitions with descriptive comments. No execution, data handling, or external interactions are present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No functional errors are apparent. Some TODOs and incomplete docstrings are present but are benign and typical during development.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and overall security risks of 0 or very close (0.1). These are reasonable given the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  Zero across all reports aligns with the code's static nature. No malicious payloads or behaviors are detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  Zero, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign a very low risk score (mostly 0, some 0.1). Given the code is purely enums and comments, this is appropriate.\n\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:**  \n  No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n- **Consistency of Scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0**  \n  No malicious activity or payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n  Clear, readable enum definitions.\n\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (or very close, e.g., 0.1)  \n  No security risks identified; minimal development notes do not constitute risk.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n- The extensive comments and TODOs suggest ongoing development but do not introduce security concerns.\n- The code is a utility module meant to facilitate FFmpeg command construction, not executing or processing untrusted data.\n- No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThis code is a benign, static enumeration module with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores should remain at **0 for malware and obfuscated**, with a **risk score of 0**. The current reports are accurate and justified.\n\n**Recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis or specific security testing is required.",
