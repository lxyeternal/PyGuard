  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is solely defining enums for FFmpeg codecs, formats, filters, and pixel formats.\n   - No execution logic, input handling, external command invocation, or data processing is present.\n   - No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as static enum definitions with extensive comments.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), aligning with the static, non-executable nature.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is justified.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are well below 0.5.\n   - Given the code's static, read-only enum definitions, this is appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n   - No suspicious behaviors such as code injection, network activity, or obfuscation are observed.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and accurate, avoiding unwarranted assumptions.\n   - The presence of TODO comments and incomplete documentation is benign and common in development code.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the static, safe nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — No security risks identified.\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a static enumeration module intended to standardize FFmpeg parameter options. It contains no executable logic, no external data handling, and no signs of malicious intent. The extensive comments and TODO notes are typical in development environments and do not imply security issues.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
