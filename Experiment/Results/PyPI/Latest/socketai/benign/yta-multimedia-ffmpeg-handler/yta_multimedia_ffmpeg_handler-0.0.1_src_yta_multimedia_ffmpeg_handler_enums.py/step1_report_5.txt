{
  "purpose": "Define enumerations for various FFmpeg codecs, formats, filters, and pixel formats to facilitate video and audio processing commands.",
  "sources": "Imports the YTAEnum class from an external module 'yta_general_utils.programming.enum'. No other external data sources or user inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists within this code. It solely defines static enums without dynamic data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code consists solely of enum class definitions and descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code provides enum classes for FFmpeg codecs, formats, filters, and pixel formats, with comprehensive documentation and URLs for more info. There are no functions, no external input handling, and no runtime data processing. No suspicious or malicious code is evident. All enum values are static strings representing known FFmpeg options. Comments suggest planned or incomplete features, but these are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of enum definitions for FFmpeg-related parameters, with detailed documentation. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be a helper module to standardize command parameters for FFmpeg usage.",
