The only minor concern is the deserialization of untrusted data in from_b64, which is a typical protobuf pattern. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the minimal risk associated with deserialization but not indicating malicious activity."

The scores assigned in the reports—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: approximately 0.1–0.2—are appropriate and justified given the analysis. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The external library's trustworthiness should be considered, but based solely on this code, it is safe."
