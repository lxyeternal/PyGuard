  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign data serialization module for flight booking data, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The only minor concern is the deserialization of untrusted data in from_b64, which is a typical protobuf pattern. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the minimal risk associated with deserialization but not indicating malicious activity."
