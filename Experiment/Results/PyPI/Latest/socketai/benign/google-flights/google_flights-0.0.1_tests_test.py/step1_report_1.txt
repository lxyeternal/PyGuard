{
  "purpose": "The code automates the creation of a flight search filter, fetches flight data based on the filter, and displays the results.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user-specified airport and airline search parameters, static date strings, and the filter creation functions from the 'google_flights' library.",
  "sinks": "Data is retrieved via 'get_flights_from_filter' and printed to standard output. No external or untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (search_airport, search_airline, date, passenger info) flow into 'create_filter', which produces a filter object; this filter is then used to fetch flight data, which is processed and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are detected. The code appears to perform straightforward data retrieval and display operations.",
  "analysis": "The script constructs a flight search filter with user-supplied search parameters, then fetches flight data using 'get_flights_from_filter'. The data is printed to the console. No code injection, malicious data handling, or suspicious network activity is present. The functions used seem legitimate for a flight data retrieval process. The code does not handle or leak sensitive information; it only prints retrieved flight data. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign workflow script that interacts with the 'google_flights' library to search and display flight data. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The code is well-structured for its purpose and does not exhibit suspicious activity.",
