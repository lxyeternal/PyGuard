  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and does not exhibit malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: approximately 0.1–0.2—are appropriate and justified given the analysis. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The external library's trustworthiness should be considered, but based solely on this code, it is safe."
