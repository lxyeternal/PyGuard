{
  "purpose": "The script tests a workflow for creating a flight filter, fetching flight data based on that filter, and displaying the results.",
  "sources": "Input data includes search parameters such as airline, airport, date, and passenger details; data retrieval is performed via get_flights_from_filter.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are printed to the console; no direct sinks for untrusted data manipulation or external system interaction are present.",
  "flows": "User inputs (search parameters) flow into create_filter; create_filter outputs a filter object used by get_flights_from_filter; retrieved data is processed and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; no suspicious or hidden code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions and classes from a module named google_flights, constructs a flight filter with specific parameters, and retrieves flight data based on that filter. The process includes exception handling during data retrieval. The script primarily handles user-supplied or predefined search criteria and outputs flight options to the console. No external network communications or data exfiltration routines are visible. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The logic appears standard for a flight search workflow, and the use of the imported functions seems appropriate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a straightforward flight search workflow, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms. The overall security risk is minimal.",
