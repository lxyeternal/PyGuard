{
  "purpose": "The code is a test workflow for creating a flight filter, fetching flight data based on that filter, and displaying the results, likely for a flight search automation or analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data includes static strings (e.g., dates, airport codes), function parameters (search_airline, search_airport), and user-provided filters. No external untrusted input is explicitly read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The code calls external functions that may perform network requests or data processing, such as create_filter and get_flights_from_filter. No direct data leaks or sensitive data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static inputs and function calls (search_airline, search_airport) into create_filter, then from create_filter into get_flights_from_filter, and finally to output functions that display the flight data. No untrusted input flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard for a flight search workflow with no unusual constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The script constructs a flight filter with fixed data, calls external functions presumed to handle network requests, and outputs the results. It handles exceptions during data retrieval and checks for None results. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are observed. The code appears straightforward and focused on data processing and display.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign test workflow for flight data retrieval and display. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security threats are detected based on the provided code. It functions as an application-level script with no evident security risks.",
