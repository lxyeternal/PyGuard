{
  "purpose": "The code constructs a flight search filter and retrieves flight data from an external source, then displays the results.",
  "sources": "Reads user input via search_airline and search_airport functions, and creates a filter with create_filter; also reads flight data from get_flights_from_filter.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to console using print statements; no sinks involving data leakage or external connections are present.",
  "flows": "Input from search functions flows into create_filter; the filter is used by get_flights_from_filter to fetch data; retrieved data is processed and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. Usage of specific flight data parameters appears typical.",
  "analysis": "The script appears to be a straightforward interaction with an external flight data API via the google_flights module. It constructs filters, fetches data, and displays results. There are no signs of malicious code such as network exfiltration, system modification, or credential theft. The code relies on imported functions whose implementations are unknown, but their usage here seems standard and non-malicious. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical data retrieval and display tasks related to flight search without signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign application of the google_flights module.",
