{
  "purpose": "The code fetches and parses flight data from Google Flights, utilizing web scraping techniques with DOM and script parsing, to extract structured flight information.",
  "sources": "Network requests to Google Flights URL, reading script tags and HTML DOM elements for flight data, and input filter data encoded in base64.",
  "sinks": "Parsing functions that process script content and HTML elements; potential data leakage if data is mishandled, but no external sinks like network exfiltration are present.",
  "flows": "Input filter data is encoded and sent as URL parameters; response text is parsed via regex or DOM traversal; extracted data is assembled into structured objects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of impersonation headers, hardcoded cookies, and disabling SSL verification (`verify=False`), which are security concerns but not malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard web scraping with straightforward parsing logic. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The insecure SSL configuration and impersonation tokens pose security risks but do not constitute malware. The regex-based extraction from scripts is fragile but common in scraping. The code's overall behavior indicates benign data collection rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign web scraper with insecure network practices. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation. The primary concern is security configuration, not malicious intent.",
