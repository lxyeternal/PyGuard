  "purpose": "Web scraping functions to search for airline and airport data from the IATA website using user input, then parsing HTML responses to extract relevant information.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET requests constructed with user input embedded in URL parameters.",
  "sinks": "Parsed data extracted via regex; no untrusted data flows to external systems or leaks identified.",
  "flows": "User input -> URL construction -> HTTP request -> HTML response -> regex parsing -> extracted data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex for HTML parsing (fragile but not malicious); minimal exception handling with print statements; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward web scraping with requests, constructing URLs from user input, and parsing HTML with regex. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The regex parsing is fragile but not malicious; error handling is minimal and could leak internal info but does not constitute security issues. No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign and fragile nature of the code. The main concern is robustness, not security. Overall, the code is a benign data scraper with low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign web scraper for public data with no malicious or security-threatening features. The low risk score of 0.2 accurately reflects minor fragility due to regex parsing, but no malicious intent or malware is present.",
