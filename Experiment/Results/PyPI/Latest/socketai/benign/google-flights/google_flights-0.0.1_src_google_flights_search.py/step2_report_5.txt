  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations Across Reports:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward web scraper querying the IATA website for airline and airport data.\n- The code uses user input to construct URLs, makes HTTP GET requests, and parses HTML responses with regex.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code are present.\n- No evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system compromise.\n- The primary concern noted is the fragility of regex-based HTML parsing, which is a common but weak practice, not a security issue.\n- Error handling is minimal, with print statements that could leak internal details but are not malicious.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The functions are designed solely for public data retrieval.\n\n**Issues or flaws:**\n- The use of regex for HTML parsing is fragile and can break if the webpage structure changes. However, this is a robustness concern, not a security flaw.\n- Error handling via print statements could leak internal details, but again, this is not malicious.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis; no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 is assigned, reflecting minor concerns about fragile parsing and error message leakage, which is reasonable.\n- **Overall risk:** Given the benign nature, a score of around 0.2 seems appropriate.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a benign web scraper with no malicious intent.\n- The primary issues are robustness and best practices, not security.\n- The malware score should remain at **0**.\n- The obfuscated score remains at **0**.\n- The security risk score can stay at **0.2**, as minor concerns are justified.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is safe from a security perspective, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only real concern is the fragility of HTML parsing, which does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- Confirmed: No malware, no obfuscation.\n- Scores are reasonable.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is low risk, benign, and suitable for use as a public data scraper with minor robustness improvements.",
