{
  "purpose": "The code searches for airline and airport information by querying the IATA website and parsing HTML responses.",
  "sources": "User inputs 'name' parameter in 'search_airline' and 'search_airport' functions, which are included in URL query parameters.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests sent with 'requests.get'; the responses are processed by 'parse_result' which parses HTML content.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' -> URL construction -> HTTP request -> response -> 'parse_result' -> extract data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; the use of regex for HTML parsing is fragile but not malicious; no evident malicious code such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft. Error handling is minimal but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward web requests to a public website, using user-supplied input to construct search URLs. The responses are parsed with regex to extract table data. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The use of regex for HTML parsing could be fragile but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The code relies on external, publicly available sources without attempting to compromise or harm the host system.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign web scraper querying a public site for airline and airport data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its main weakness is fragile HTML parsing, but that is unrelated to security concerns.",
