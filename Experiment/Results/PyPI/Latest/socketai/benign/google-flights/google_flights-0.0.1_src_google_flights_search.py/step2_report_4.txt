  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the reported observations, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code performs HTTP GET requests to a public website (IATA) using user input, then parses HTML responses with regex.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The code does not perform any destructive actions, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.\n- The main concern highlighted is the fragility of regex-based HTML parsing, which is not a security issue but a robustness concern.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code constructs URLs with user input, performs requests, and parses responses with regex. The pattern used is straightforward and matches HTML table rows. The response is processed with `re.findall`, skipping the first match, and extracting the third group (column) from each match. This logic is sound for the described HTML structure.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** While URL construction with user input could, in theory, be exploited for injection, the context is scraping a public website, and the input is embedded in URL parameters, not executed code or system commands. The risk is minimal and does not constitute malicious activity.\n- **Error handling:** The code prints errors rather than logging securely or raising exceptions, but this is not malicious.\n- **Security risk:** The risk scores are low (~0.2), which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, justified as no malicious activity or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, reflecting minor fragility and potential for misuse if inputs are maliciously crafted, but overall low.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n- No change needed unless considering the fragility of regex parsing as a security concern, which it is not.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign web scraper for public data with no malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. The main issues are robustness and fragility of HTML parsing, not security.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
