  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All five reports agree that the code performs straightforward web scraping from the IATA website using user input to construct URLs, then parses the HTML response with regex to extract data.\n- They note the use of regex for HTML parsing is fragile but not malicious.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are identified.\n- Exception handling is minimal, with errors printed rather than logged securely or raised.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are observed.\n- The main concern is the fragility of regex-based HTML parsing, which could lead to errors but not security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- The regex parsing is fragile but not malicious.\n- No data leakage, code injection, or network exfiltration is evident.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No suspicious anomalies beyond standard web scraping practices.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- Use of regex for HTML parsing is unreliable; a proper HTML parser (like BeautifulSoup) would be more robust.\n- Exception handling prints errors directly, which could leak internal details if logs are accessible.\n- URL parameters are directly constructed from user input without sanitization, which could lead to injection issues, but given the context (public data scraping), this is not a security risk per se.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 across all reports, reflecting low security risk mainly due to fragile parsing and error handling.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes. The overall assessment is that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or malware. The low risk score is appropriate, and the malware score is correctly zero.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- No evidence of malicious activity or malware.\n- The code interacts with a reputable public website.\n- No data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code observed.\n- The only concern is the fragility of parsing, which does not impact security.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- Maintain the malware score at 0.\n- Keep the risk score low (~0.2), as the code is benign but fragile.\n- The obfuscated score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| **0**          | **0**              | **0.2**  |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign web scraper with no malicious or security-threatening features. The minor risk stems from fragile HTML parsing and minimal error handling, not from any malicious intent.\n\n**Note:** For improved robustness, consider replacing regex with an HTML parser and improving error handling.",
