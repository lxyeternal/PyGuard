{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to search for airline and airport information by querying a public website (IATA) and parsing the HTML response.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters 'name' for search queries and the HTTP response data from requests.get calls.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the parse_result function, which processes the HTTP response data. No data is written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'name' are used to construct URLs (sources), then HTTP GET requests are made, and responses are parsed using regex patterns to extract data (source-to-sink flow).",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials or secrets. The requests are made to a well-known, reputable public website (IATA). The regex pattern is straightforward. No obfuscated or suspicious code features are present. Exception handling is minimal but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard HTTP GET requests to a public website to retrieve search results for airlines and airports, then uses regex to parse HTML responses. The use of regex for HTML parsing is fragile but not malicious. No data leakage, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. There are no external or hidden network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution observed. The code is structured, readable, and aligns with typical search and parse operations. Overall, there is no indication of malicious intent or malware. The requests to a legitimate public site and absence of secret data or malicious payloads suggest low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward web scraper for public data with no malicious features or malware. It does not pose security risks beyond typical concerns associated with HTML parsing and external HTTP requests, which are standard in such tools.",
