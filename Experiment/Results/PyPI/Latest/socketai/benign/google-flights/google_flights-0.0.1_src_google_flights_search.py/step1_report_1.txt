{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to search for airline and airport information from the IATA website via HTTP GET requests and parse the HTML response to extract relevant data.",
  "sources": "The code reads user-provided input parameters ('name') for search queries, and makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs using the 'requests' library.",
  "sinks": "The data received from the external requests (response.text) is processed with regex to extract specific HTML content. No data is written to disk or sent over the network beyond the initial request.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('name') are used to construct URLs, which are requested from the server; the server response is then parsed with regex to extract desired data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; the URL parameters are constructed straightforwardly. The code uses regex for HTML parsing, which is fragile but not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard web request operations to fetch data from a public API-like website, then parses HTML content using regex. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or malicious patterns are present. The functions do not perform any destructive or unauthorized actions. The use of regex for HTML parsing is a weak practice but not malicious. No suspicious or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for querying and parsing airline and airport data from a public source. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
