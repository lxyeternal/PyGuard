  "purpose": "Provides functions to search airline and airport information from IATA's website by scraping HTML content.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from user-provided 'name' parameters in the search functions.",
  "sinks": "The code sends HTTP GET requests to a specific URL based on input parameters; response data is parsed for information.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> URL construction -> HTTP request -> response -> parse_result() -> extracted data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code uses regular expressions to parse HTML, which is fragile but not inherently malicious. The print statement for exceptions could leak information if logs are accessible externally.",
  "analysis": "The functions 'search_airline' and 'search_airport' generate URLs with user input embedded directly, which could lead to injection or misuse if inputs are maliciously crafted; however, these are URLs for public data scraping. The use of regex for HTML parsing is fragile but not suspicious. The code does not perform any unsafe operations such as executing untrusted code, connecting to unknown domains, or leaking data beyond parsing the response. The 'print' statement on exceptions could expose internal error details but is not malicious. There is no evidence of backdoors, remote code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The requests library is used normally, and there are no suspicious obfuscations or obfuscated code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward web scraper for IATA public data. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage indicators. The main security concern is fragile HTML parsing and potential information leakage via error printing, but these are not malicious. Overall, the code appears benign with low risk.",
