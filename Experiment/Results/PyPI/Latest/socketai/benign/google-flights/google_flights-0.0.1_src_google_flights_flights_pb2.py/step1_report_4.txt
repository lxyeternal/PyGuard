{
  "purpose": "Generated protocol buffer code for defining flight-related data structures and serialization methods.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'google.protobuf' libraries, serialized file content containing protocol buffer definitions.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not process external input or perform data output operations.",
  "flows": "None; the code is purely definitional, establishing data schemas without executing runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is auto-generated protobuf schema without suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is an auto-generated Python module from the protocol buffer compiler, defining message schemas for flight data. It imports necessary protobuf modules, validates runtime version, registers message types, and loads serialized descriptor data. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or external network interactions. The content is purely declarative and intended for data serialization, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard auto-generated protobuf schema definitions with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves as a data structure definition for a larger application and does not contain harmful behaviors.",
