{
  "purpose": "Generated protocol buffer code for serializing and deserializing flight-related data structures, used as part of a larger application or service.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.protobuf library, serialized descriptor data within the AddSerializedFile() method.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform malicious actions; the code primarily sets up data structures.",
  "flows": "Initialization of descriptors and message types from serialized data, no data flow from external sources or to sinks beyond protobuf setup.",
  "anomalies": "The code is auto-generated with standard protobuf boilerplate; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard auto-generated protobuf module, which defines message descriptors for flight data structures. It includes import statements, version validation, descriptor registration, and message building. No suspicious or malicious logic, external network calls, or data leaks are present. The code's purpose is purely data serialization, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical auto-generated protobuf code module for flight data schemas, with no indications of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It functions solely to define message structures used elsewhere in the application.",
