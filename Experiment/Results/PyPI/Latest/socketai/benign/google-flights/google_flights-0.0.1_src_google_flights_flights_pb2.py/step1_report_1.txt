{
  "purpose": "Generated Python code for protocol buffer message definitions based on 'flights.proto' schema.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'google.protobuf' library, and serialized descriptor data embedded within the code.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; code mainly defines data structures and descriptors. No data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Initialization and registration of protobuf message descriptors; no data processing or transmission present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic. The code is a standard protobuf generated file.",
  "analysis": "This code is auto-generated by the protobuf compiler. It imports necessary protobuf modules, validates runtime version, and registers message descriptors for 'Airports', 'FlightData', 'Info', 'Price', 'ItinerarySummary', 'Seat', 'Trip', and 'Passenger'. It does not contain any logic beyond descriptor registration. No input/output handling, network connections, or sensitive data handling are present. The structure and content follow standard protobuf code generation patterns, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard protobuf generated Python module with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It serves solely as data structure definitions for use in other code. There are no suspicious activities or malicious payloads detected.",
