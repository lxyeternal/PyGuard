{
  "purpose": "This code defines protobuf message schemas for flight data, including airports, flights, passengers, and related information, generated from 'flights.proto'.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'flights.proto' schema during generation; runtime data is not processed here.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform data output operations.",
  "flows": "The code sets up message descriptors and schema definitions without runtime data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is standard auto-generated protobuf schema definitions with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated protobuf module containing message schema definitions for flight data. It imports protobuf modules, validates runtime version, registers message descriptors, and loads serialized descriptor data. There are no input/output operations, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The code is purely declarative, serving as data schemas. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign, schema-only nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated protobuf schema definition for flight data, posing no security threat or malicious intent. It is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and accurate.",
