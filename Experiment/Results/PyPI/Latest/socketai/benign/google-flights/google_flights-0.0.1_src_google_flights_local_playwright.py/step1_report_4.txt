{
  "purpose": "The code fetches flight information from Google Travel using Playwright, automating browser interactions to click buttons and retrieve page content.",
  "sources": "The URL is constructed from user-provided parameters; page.goto(url) loads external web content; page.locator and element attribute retrieval access webpage elements and attributes.",
  "sinks": "Return of page inner HTML content; no direct data leaks but exposes webpage content retrieval; no external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "URL construction from params → page.goto(url) → webpage interactions (clicks) → retrieve innerHTML → return as body.",
  "anomalies": "Use of headless=False (visible browser) and many Chromium flags could be suspicious but are common in automation; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses Playwright to automate a Chromium browser session, navigating to a URL built from input parameters. It interacts with webpage elements, such as clicking 'Accept all' on consent pages and clicking flight detail buttons identified by specific selectors. The data retrieved is the inner HTML of a locator element, returned in a dummy response object. The code does not contain obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious external network activity beyond standard web scraping. No hardcoded secrets or credential theft mechanisms are present. The code appears legitimate for automation purposes, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard web automation script designed for fetching and parsing flight data from Google Travel. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided code. Its primary function is data extraction through browser automation.",
