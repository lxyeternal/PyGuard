{
  "purpose": "The code fetches flight information from Google Flights using Playwright to automate browser actions, including accepting cookies and clicking buttons to reveal detailed flight info.",
  "sources": "The URL constructed from input parameters; the page.goto() call with the user-provided URL; interaction with page elements and attributes.",
  "sinks": "Fetching page content (innerHTML), clicking buttons, and evaluating innerHTML, which could potentially be exploited if untrusted URLs or malicious DOM manipulations are involved.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> URL construction -> page.goto() -> interactions with page elements (clicks, attribute reads) -> retrieval of innerHTML content.",
  "anomalies": "The code launches a headless browser with many command-line args that disable security features (e.g., '--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox'). The 'headless=False' setting allows GUI access, which is unusual for automated scraping. The code accepts cookies and interacts with page elements, which could be exploited for malicious DOM manipulations if the URL is untrusted. There is no explicit validation or sanitization of the URL or page content.",
  "analysis": "The script automates Google Flights data retrieval via Playwright, with extensive browser args that disable security features, potentially exposing the system. It interacts with page elements dynamically, which could be manipulated if the URL is malicious. However, it does not send data over the network outside the scope of page interactions or attempt to exfiltrate data explicitly. The code is primarily for web scraping purposes but could be exploited if fed malicious URLs or used in a malicious environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard web scraper for Google Flights, with no explicit malicious intent. However, the use of insecure browser flags and handling of arbitrary URLs could be exploited in a malicious context. The overall risk is low but warrants caution if untrusted URLs are used.",
