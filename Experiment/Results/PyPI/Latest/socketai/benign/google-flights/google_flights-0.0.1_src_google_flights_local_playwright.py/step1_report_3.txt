  "purpose": "Fetch flight information webpage content using Playwright automation.",
  "sources": "Input URL parameter and parameters used to construct the URL in 'local_playwright_fetch'.",
  "sinks": "Navigation to the URL, clicking buttons on the page, retrieving innerHTML of page elements.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> URL construction -> fetch_with_playwright() -> page navigation -> interactions -> return innerHTML.",
  "anomalies": "Use of headless=False, extensive browser launch arguments, and interaction with Google consent pages. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activities observed. The code dynamically interacts with webpage elements but does not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code asynchronously fetches webpage content via Playwright, navigating to URLs built from input parameters. It handles consent prompts and interacts with page elements by clicking buttons with specific aria-labels. No evidence of data exfiltration, network abuse, or malicious behavior is present. The extensive browser launch arguments may be for performance or compatibility, not malicious intent. The code appears to be a legitimate automation script for retrieving flight data, with no indications of backdoors, credential theft, or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard web automation tool to fetch flight data, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It performs expected actions for web scraping, with no suspicious network activity or hidden malicious code.",
