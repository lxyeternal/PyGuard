  "purpose": "Automate Google Flights data extraction via Playwright, interacting with web pages and retrieving flight information.",
  "sources": "URL parameter construction, page.goto(), page.locator('.eQ35Ce'), button.get_attribute('aria-label')",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data leaks or external command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Input URL -> page.goto() -> locate elements -> interact (click, scroll) -> extract innerHTML",
  "anomalies": "Use of extensive browser flags disabling security features (--no-sandbox, --disable-setuid-sandbox, etc.), headless=False for debugging, no input validation or URL sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard web scraping with Playwright, accepting cookies, clicking buttons, and extracting HTML content. It launches Chromium with numerous flags that disable security features, which could be exploited if used with malicious URLs or in untrusted environments. No malicious payloads, backdoors, obfuscation, or data exfiltration are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with legitimate automation practices. The insecure flags and exposure to untrusted URLs are potential security concerns but do not constitute malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk is moderate (0.2-0.3) depending on environment and URL trustworthiness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical web scraping script with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The primary security consideration is the use of insecure Chromium flags, which could be exploited if misused. Overall, the code is benign, with a low to moderate security risk depending on context.",
