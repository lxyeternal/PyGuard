{
  "purpose": "The code fetches flight information from Google Travel using Playwright to automate a browser interaction.",
  "sources": "Input URL parameters in 'local_playwright_fetch' function; URL from 'params' dictionary; user-provided URL in 'fetch_with_playwright'.",
  "sinks": "Browser automation actions (clicking, navigating, extracting innerHTML); returning the body content in a dummy response.",
  "flows": "Parameters in URL -> 'fetch_with_playwright' constructs URL -> Playwright automates browser to fetch page -> clicks on buttons -> extracts innerHTML -> returns response.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'headless=False' exposes the browser window visibly; no evident malicious code or backdoors; no suspicious data exfiltration or network communication beyond the intended fetch.",
  "analysis": "The code automates a Chromium browser via Playwright to fetch and interact with Google Flights pages. It navigates, accepts cookies, clicks on specific buttons, and extracts HTML content. No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code are present. The use of a non-headless browser might be for debugging or transparency but does not indicate malicious intent. The code appears focused on web scraping with browser automation, without any malicious or sabotage behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs automated web scraping of flight data using Playwright without evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It primarily interacts with a well-known site for data extraction purposes. No malicious behavior or supply chain threats are evident.",
