  "purpose": "This code module imports specific classes and functions from the 'google_flights' package modules and defines an __all__ list to expose these components for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'google_flights.filter', 'google_flights.flights_pb_implem', 'google_flights.main', and 'google_flights.search'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only performs static imports and exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code does not process or transmit data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; the code is straightforward and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, serving as an API exposure layer. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic execution. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard, benign Python interface for exposing components of the 'google_flights' package. There are no indications of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
