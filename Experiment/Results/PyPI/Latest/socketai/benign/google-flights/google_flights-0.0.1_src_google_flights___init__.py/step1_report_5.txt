  "purpose": "The code serves as an import and export module for various functions and classes related to Google Flights data processing and search functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'google_flights' package modules: filter, flights_pb_implem, main, and search.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data outputs are present; the code mainly re-exports imported components.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and re-exports specific classes/functions, enabling other modules to access these components.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ list for module exports. It does not process data, execute dynamic code, or perform any network or file operations. The imports are from a package named 'google_flights' which appears to be a standard naming convention. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module that re-exports components from the 'google_flights' package. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code’s purpose appears benign, facilitating modular access to flight-related functionalities.",
