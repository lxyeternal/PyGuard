{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions and classes related to flight data processing and search functionalities from the 'google_flights' module, and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements at the beginning of the file, importing specific functions and classes from various submodules within 'google_flights'.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network connections, file operations, or command executions within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code only defines imports and an __all__ list; no data flows or untrusted data handling is present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for a module export.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, which is typical for Python modules that organize public API components. No data processing, user input, or external interactions are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The structure indicates this is a simple interface module exposing certain functions and classes for external use, with no security risks apparent in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module export script with no malicious intent, no suspicious patterns, and no security concerns. It functions as an interface to the 'google_flights' package components.",
