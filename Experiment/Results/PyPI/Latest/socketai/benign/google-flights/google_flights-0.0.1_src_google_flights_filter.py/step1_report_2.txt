{
  "purpose": "The function creates a TFSData object used as a filter for flight searches based on provided parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the function arguments: flight_data, passengers, trip, seat, max_stops.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a TFSData object via the from_interface method; no data leaks or untrusted data effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are processed and used to modify flight_data and to generate a TFSData object; no external data flows or network operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. No obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution, or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it updates the max_stops attribute of each FlightData object in the list and then constructs a TFSData object using provided parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden functionalities. It relies on external library methods and standard Python constructs. The import of google_flights.flights_pb_implem suggests protocol buffer usage, which is standard for structured data exchange, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of a flight filtering system. It manipulates input data and produces a structured filter object without any suspicious or malicious activity. No malware indicators or security risks are evident.",
