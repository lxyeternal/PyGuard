{
  "purpose": "Create a flight filter object based on provided flight data, trip type, passengers, seat class, and maximum stops.",
  "sources": "The function reads input parameters: flight_data, passengers, trip, seat, max_stops.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any clear sinks that handle untrusted data; it calls a method to create a TFSData object from trusted data.",
  "flows": "Flight data and parameters are passed into create_filter, with flight_data being modified locally, then used in TFSData.from_interface to produce the output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The only operation is setting an attribute on flight_data objects.",
  "analysis": "The function primarily modifies the flight_data objects by setting max_stops. It then calls a class method to generate a TFSData object. The input parameters appear to be used as intended, with no indication of malicious behavior. No external data is fetched or sent, and no insecure operations are performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward data transformation function for creating a flight filter. No malicious or suspicious activities are evident. It operates on trusted input data and returns a structured object.",
