{
  "purpose": "To create a filter configuration object (`TFSData`) based on provided flight data, trip type, passengers, seat class, and optional maximum stops.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: `flight_data`, `passengers`, `trip`, `seat`, and `max_stops`",
  "sinks": "The `TFSData.from_interface()` method potentially processes the input data; no direct untrusted sink like network or file operations observed in this code snippet",
  "flows": "Data flows from function arguments to assignment within the loop and then into `TFSData.from_interface()`",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code takes flight data and configuration parameters to set the `max_stops` attribute on each `FlightData` object. It then constructs a `TFSData` object via a class method, passing the processed data. There are no suspicious operations, no external data being fetched or transmitted, and no hidden behaviors. The method appears to be straightforward data processing and object creation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple data setting and object construction without any malicious intent or security issues. It appears benign and consistent with typical application logic.",
