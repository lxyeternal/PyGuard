  "purpose": "Create a flight filter configuration based on provided flight data, trip type, passengers, seat class, and optional maximum stops.",
  "sources": "Input list of FlightData objects, parameters: trip, passengers, seat, max_stops.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data output occurs.",
  "flows": "Input flight_data list is mutated by setting max_stops; then data is passed to TFSData.from_interface() for object creation.",
  "anomalies": "In-place mutation of flight_data objects by setting max_stops; no validation of max_stops value; reliance on external method without internal validation.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly updates each FlightData object's max_stops attribute, then constructs a TFSData object via a class method. No network activity, data exfiltration, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The mutation of input objects could be a side effect but is common in data processing. The external method's security cannot be assessed, but assuming standard implementation, no vulnerabilities are evident. The code is clear, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious logic. Scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are consistent with this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign data manipulation function with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score accounts for in-place mutation of input data, which is acceptable in this context. No further action or concern is warranted.",
