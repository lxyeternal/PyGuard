  "purpose": "The function creates a filtered flight search object (TFSData) based on provided flight data, trip type, passengers, seat class, and optional maximum stops.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: flight_data (list of FlightData), passengers (Passengers), and max_stops (optional).",
  "sinks": "The method TFSData.from_interface receives the processed data to generate a TFSData object.",
  "flows": "flight_data is iterated over to set max_stops; then data is passed to TFSData.from_interface, which generates the return object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code, and no data leaks are evident. The code only modifies the input objects and calls an external method.",
  "analysis": "The code performs parameter validation via type hints and docstring, modifies each FlightData object in flight_data to set max_stops, and constructs a TFSData object through a class method. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, no obfuscated elements, and no external data flows that could leak information or perform malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility function for creating a flight filter object. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply updates the flight data objects with a max_stops value and constructs a data object for further use.",
