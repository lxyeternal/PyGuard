{
  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns such as obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, and unsafe data flows.",
  "sources": "Input from environment variables, function parameters, hardcoded strings, obfuscated variables, base64-encoded payloads, dynamic execution points (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "System commands, network sockets, file operations, environment variables, untrusted data flows leading to code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Sources (inputs) feed into obfuscated or dynamic code segments, potentially reaching sinks like system commands or network calls via eval/exec or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with obfuscated variables, base64 or other encoding schemes, hardcoded strings, dynamic code loading, absence of clear purpose, suspicious import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation techniques and dynamic execution methods, which are common in malicious payloads. The presence of eval/exec combined with obfuscated variables and encoding suggests an attempt to conceal malicious intent. No explicit network activity or data exfiltration is confirmed, but the suspicious patterns warrant concern. Benign code lacks obfuscation and dynamic features. The analysis indicates moderate to high suspicion, especially in heavily obfuscated segments, but lacks definitive malicious actions. Static analysis limitations prevent full confirmation; dynamic testing is recommended.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion of malicious intent, but no concrete malicious activity is confirmed. The risk and malware scores should reflect moderate concern, with higher suspicion in heavily obfuscated segments. Further dynamic analysis is advised to confirm malicious payloads.",
