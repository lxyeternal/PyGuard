      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation for sandboxed Python code execution. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. The overall security posture is low risk, primarily due to the nature of executing untrusted code, which is outside the scope of this implementation."

      "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion of malicious intent, but no concrete malicious activity is confirmed. The risk and malware scores should reflect moderate concern, with higher suspicion in heavily obfuscated segments. Further dynamic analysis is advised to confirm malicious payloads."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate sandbox execution framework with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The main external risk stems from the implementation of wrap_command, which must be verified for input sanitization to prevent command injection. Based on the provided code and reports, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3, aligning with the low likelihood of malicious activity but acknowledging potential command injection vulnerabilities if wrap_command is insecure."

The low security risk score is justified given the controlled compilation process and sandbox mitigation. The malware score remains zero, indicating no malicious intent."

Other reports are consistent with their low suspicion levels. Vigilance is advised for code exhibiting these features, and further static/dynamic analysis is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
