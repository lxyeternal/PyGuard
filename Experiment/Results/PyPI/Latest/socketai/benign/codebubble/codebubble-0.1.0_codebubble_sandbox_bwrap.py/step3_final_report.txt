{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a sandbox environment using 'bwrap' to execute untrusted code with resource limits, environment configuration, and output parsing.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters, executable paths, and the time output file; checks for executable existence.",
  "sinks": "Executes wrapped commands, reads output files, logs warnings, and interprets return codes and output sizes.",
  "flows": "Constructs command with resource limits and environment, executes in sandbox, then reads and parses time output and result status.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected; standard resource management and logging warnings for missing paths.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward sandbox implementation that constructs a command with resource limits and environment variables, executes it, and interprets the results. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. External functions are used for command wrapping, but their usage appears standard. The code handles return codes and output sizes appropriately, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure sandbox setup with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
