{
  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata and configuration for building a Python package using setuptools, specifically for a project named 'codebubble'.",
  "sources": "Reads static file 'README.md' for long description; no untrusted input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script only sets metadata and dependencies without data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard setup script with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup.py using setuptools, with static metadata, dependencies, and package configuration. It reads a README file for description and specifies dependencies like pydantic and loguru. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or untrusted input handling. The code aligns with common packaging practices and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. All signals indicate a benign, standard setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, reflecting its safe and standard nature.",
