  "purpose": "This setup script is used to package and distribute the 'codebubble' Python project, which is described as a rootless sandbox for running untrusted code.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long_description, collects package information via find_packages, and specifies dependencies in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "N/A, no untrusted data flow or external communication detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed. All functions and parameters follow standard setup.py conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup configuration using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion/exclusion. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It does not perform any operations beyond packaging setup, and the dependencies listed are common and benign. There are no hardcoded credentials, external network calls, or other signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a benign packaging configuration for the 'codebubble' project.",
