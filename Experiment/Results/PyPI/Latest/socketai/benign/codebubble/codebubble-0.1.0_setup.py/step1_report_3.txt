{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'codebubble', intended as a rootless sandbox for running untrusted code.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from 'README.md' for the long description and gathers package dependencies from 'install_requires'. It also reads package metadata such as author, email, and URL.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data flow is minimal; the main concern is reading from 'README.md', which is a static file. Dependencies are specified but not executed or sourced from untrusted locations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks, as the setup script primarily reads static files and specifies dependencies without executing external or untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code follows standard setup patterns without suspicious code, hardcoded secrets beyond public contact info, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for packaging a Python project. It reads a long description from a file and specifies dependencies, authorship, and package data. No code execution or untrusted data handling occurs beyond file reading. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears safe and intended for package configuration without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
