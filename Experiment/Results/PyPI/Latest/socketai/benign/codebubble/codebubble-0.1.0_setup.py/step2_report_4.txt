  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is found.\n- The code simply reads static files, specifies dependencies, and defines package metadata.\n- The purpose of the package (a sandbox for untrusted code) is noted, but the setup script itself does not implement or invoke sandboxing logic.\n- The reports uniformly assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: it is a typical `setup.py` with no dynamic or malicious code.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious URLs or patterns.\n- No data flows involving untrusted input or runtime code execution.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The reports are accurate; no errors or flaws are evident.\n- The reasoning that the script is benign and standard is correct.\n- No adjustments needed for the scores; all are set to zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score (0):** No malicious activity or payloads detected.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Risk score (0):** No security risks identified; the script is purely for packaging.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The package's purpose (sandboxing untrusted code) is external to this script; this script does not perform or facilitate sandboxing directly.\n- The use of dependencies like `pydantic` and `loguru` is standard and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Based on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assigned scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**The code is benign and aligns with standard packaging practices.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n- The code is a straightforward, standard `setup.py`.\n- No malicious or suspicious elements are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The package setup script is safe; no security concerns are indicated.",
