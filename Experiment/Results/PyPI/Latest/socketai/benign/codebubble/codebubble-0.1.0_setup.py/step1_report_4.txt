{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'codebubble' package, which appears to be a sandbox environment for executing untrusted code.",
  "sources": "Input data from package metadata fields (name, version, description, author, email, URL), and dependencies listed in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "Installation of dependencies, reading README.md file, and package metadata could potentially be exploited if manipulated, but no direct security risk is evident in these actions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the script performs package configuration without data flow from untrusted sources or sinks that could lead to data leakage or code execution vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious constructs observed. Use of standard setup tools and practices with no hardcoded secrets or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads the README.md file for long description, specifies dependencies, and sets package info. All code is standard and does not include any dynamic execution, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious behavior. No external input handling or untrusted data processing present that could lead to security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be benign, standard, and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. It only performs package configuration tasks without executing or injecting code, nor does it contain any malicious payloads.",
