{
  "purpose": "Defines a C++ code executor that compiles C++ source code into an executable within a sandbox environment.",
  "sources": "User-provided 'code' string used to write the C++ source file; 'workspace' path for file operations.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the 'g++' compiler with the source file path as an argument; subprocess.run to invoke compilation.",
  "flows": "Code writes user input to 'main.cpp' in the workspace, then invokes the compiler with the source file path, potentially executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Usage of subprocess.run for compilation is standard, but unvalidated user code is a concern, although typical in such environments.",
  "analysis": "The script writes the user-supplied code string into a source file 'main.cpp' in the workspace directory. It then constructs a command to invoke the g++ compiler with specified flags. The compilation process runs via subprocess.run, capturing stdout and stderr. The code does not include any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications. It relies on sandboxing to mitigate execution risks. No obfuscated or malicious code segments are present, and no hardcoded secrets are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a safe C++ compilation tool assuming the sandbox prevents malicious code execution. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling within this module. It is a standard compilation wrapper with minimal security concerns given proper sandboxing.",
