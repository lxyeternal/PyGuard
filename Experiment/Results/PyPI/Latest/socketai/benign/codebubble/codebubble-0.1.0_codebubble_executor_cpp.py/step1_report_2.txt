{
  "purpose": "Defines a C++ code executor class that compiles C++ source code using a specified compiler and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads 'code' parameter to write source code to 'main.cpp'; reads 'workspace' path for file locations; reads 'config.compiler_path' for compiler location.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.run to execute the compiler command; writes source code to file system; no external data outputs detected.",
  "flows": "Code writes 'code' to file system, then runs the compiler executable with source file as input, producing output executable; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; the code dynamically writes and compiles code but does not execute or upload data elsewhere; no unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code writes user-provided code into a source file and compiles it using a configurable compiler path. It records compile time and captures stdout/stderr. No evidence of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or external network communication during compilation. The subprocess call is standard for compilation tasks. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical code compilation utility with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It performs code writing and compilation securely, assuming the configuration is trusted. There are no indicators of malware or malicious supply chain tampering.",
