{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to compile C++ code within a sandbox environment, preparing an executable from source code.",
  "sources": "Reads 'code' input to write to 'main.cpp', reads 'workspace' path for file creation, and executes the compiler via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.run() to invoke the compiler, potentially executing code that could be malicious if 'code' input is malicious.",
  "flows": "Code input -> writes to 'main.cpp' -> runs compiler via subprocess with specified command and flags.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or suspicious variable names. Uses subprocess to compile code, which is standard but could be risky if input is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script creates a source file from provided code, then compiles it using a subprocess call with specified compiler path and flags. No external inputs are directly used in the subprocess command other than the 'code' content written to file. The subprocess command executes the compiler; if 'code' is malicious, it could potentially attempt to exploit compiler vulnerabilities, but this is typical behavior for sandboxed code compilation. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated segments. It relies on the correctness and security of the sandbox and compiler.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard sandboxed compilation of user-provided C++ code with no evident malicious intent or malicious behavior. It is typical for code execution environments. No suspicious or malicious code behavior detected.",
