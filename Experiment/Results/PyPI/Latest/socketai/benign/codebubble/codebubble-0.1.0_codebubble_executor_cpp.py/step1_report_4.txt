{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for configuring and executing C++ compilation within a sandbox environment, primarily for code execution and testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input code as a string parameter in the prepare method; accesses sandbox configuration for workspace paths.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.run to invoke the compiler with the source file; writes code to a file in the filesystem.",
  "flows": "Code string input -> saved to main.cpp -> subprocess run executes compiler -> output and errors captured.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network activity observed. The subprocess call appears standard for compilation.",
  "analysis": "The code writes provided code into a source file and invokes g++ to compile it, capturing compilation output and errors. It uses standard libraries and practices for compilation tasks within a sandbox environment. No suspicious data leaks, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident. The subprocess invocation is typical for compilation. The code does not contain obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or malicious payloads. It performs a straightforward compilation process for testing or execution purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation for compiling C++ code within a sandbox environment. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided code.",
