{
  "purpose": "This code writes user-provided C++ source code into a file and compiles it using g++, capturing compilation outputs and timing, within a sandbox environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'code' string to write into 'main.cpp'. It also reads configuration parameters for the compiler path and flags.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run call executes the compiler command; potential risks depend on the input code and sandbox integrity but do not directly lead to data leaks or system effects within this script.",
  "flows": "Source: 'code' string written to 'main.cpp' -> Sink: subprocess.run executes compilation command with user code as input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard compilation tasks without obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script writes user code to a file and compiles it via subprocess, capturing stdout/stderr. It relies on sandboxing to mitigate risks. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The subprocess call is standard, and no network activity or data exfiltration occurs. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of this wrapper. The potential risk stems from malicious code in the input, but the code itself is safe, especially with sandboxing. The overall assessment is that the code is a typical, safe compilation wrapper with minimal security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for compiling user-provided C++ code within a sandbox. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is detected. The low security risk score is justified given the controlled compilation process and sandbox mitigation. The malware score remains zero, indicating no malicious intent.",
