  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate sandbox execution framework with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The main external risk stems from the implementation of wrap_command, which must be verified for input sanitization to prevent command injection. Based on the provided code and reports, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3, aligning with the low likelihood of malicious activity but acknowledging potential command injection vulnerabilities if wrap_command is insecure."
