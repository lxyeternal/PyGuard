  "purpose": "This code defines a framework for executing Python code within a sandbox environment, managing compilation and runtime execution, including input handling and resource limits.",
  "sources": "Input data: 'inputs' list, 'code' string, 'limits' object; also reads environment via sandbox configuration and file operations for stdout/stderr.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution (subprocess.run), file writes/reads for stdout/stderr, resource management via sandbox.wrap_command.",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed into subprocess through prepare and single_run methods, with command wrapping and environment setup, then outputs are read from files post-execution.",
  "anomalies": "Standard subprocess call with input piping, no explicit data validation or sanitization beyond resource limits. No evident hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors. Use of 'wrap_command' could potentially introduce risk if not controlled, but the implementation isn't provided here.",
  "analysis": "The code manages execution of code snippets within a sandboxed environment, carefully handling input/output files, execution timing, and error handling. There are no signs of malicious code inclusion, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms. The subprocess call relies on 'wrap_command', which could be risky if it contains malicious command injection, but the code itself does not include or execute malicious commands. The resource limits and cleanup are standard. No suspicious data exfiltration or obfuscation is present. The overall structure appears to be a controlled sandbox execution framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard sandboxed code execution environment with no evident malicious behavior or sabotage. Its design is to run arbitrary code safely, provided the 'wrap_command' function is secure. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious flows are identified. The risk level is low.",
