{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract framework for executing untrusted code snippets within a sandbox environment, managing preparation, execution, resource limits, and cleanup.",
  "sources": "Reads code during preparation, input strings for each execution, and output/error files generated during subprocess execution.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.run with commands generated by sandbox.wrap_command; potential for command injection if wrap_command is insecure.",
  "flows": "Input data is fed into subprocess via input parameter; command generated externally; output and error data are written to files and read back into the system.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; external dependency on wrap_command is a potential risk point.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard sandboxed execution environment, handling input/output and cleanup properly. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The primary security concern is the external wrap_command function, which could introduce command injection if not properly sanitized. The code's structure and logic are sound, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is detected. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The security risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3, reflecting the potential command injection risk depending on wrap_command's implementation. Overall, the code appears safe, with external validation of wrap_command's security being critical.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate sandbox execution framework with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The main external risk stems from the implementation of wrap_command, which must be verified for input sanitization to prevent command injection. Based on the provided code and reports, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3, aligning with the low likelihood of malicious activity but acknowledging potential command injection vulnerabilities if wrap_command is insecure.",
