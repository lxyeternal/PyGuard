  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All five reports describe a sandboxed code execution framework that manages preparation, execution, resource limits, and cleanup.\n- The core execution involves constructing commands via `wrap_command`, then running them with `subprocess.run`, feeding input, and capturing output/error files.\n- None of the reports identify suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors like data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors.\n- Several reports highlight that the main potential security concern hinges on the implementation of `wrap_command`, which is external and not shown.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.8–0.9), and all reports assign malware scores of 0, indicating no detected malicious code.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.2–0.3), consistent with a benign sandbox environment.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** No issues in the code snippets themselves; they implement a standard sandboxed execution framework.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** The main concern is command injection if `wrap_command` is insecure, but this is outside the provided code scope.\n- **Data exfiltration or network activity:** Not observed.\n- **Hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns:** None.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The reports correctly identify that the security depends heavily on `wrap_command`. Without its implementation, we cannot fully assess command injection risks.\n- No actual vulnerabilities or malicious activities are demonstrated or implied within the code.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is evident.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher (around 0.2–0.3) due to potential command injection if `wrap_command` is insecure, but the code itself is not malicious.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The overall security assessment should remain conservative, emphasizing that the main risk is external and depends on the implementation of `wrap_command`.\n- The code itself appears clean, well-structured, and free of malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Final Overall Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 (to reflect the potential if `wrap_command` is insecure, but no actual evidence in the code)\n\n**Note:** Since the code is a standard sandbox execution framework with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the reports align on this, the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate sandboxed execution environment with no malicious intent or behaviors. The primary concern is external, related to the implementation of `wrap_command`. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate given the evidence.",
