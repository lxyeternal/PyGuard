{
  "purpose": "This code implements a sandboxed execution environment for running code, likely in a competitive programming or testing platform, with functions for preparation, execution, and handling multiple inputs.",
  "sources": "Code reads input strings from the 'inputs' list; reads and writes files such as 'stdout.txt' and 'stderr.txt'; reads from sandbox configuration and command preparation data.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution via 'subprocess.run'; file reading/writing; removal of temporary files; command wrapping through sandbox's 'wrap_command' method.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from 'inputs' into 'single_run', then into subprocess execution; outputs are captured from files and processed into 'ExecutionResult'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of standard libraries and structured process. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs observed. The code relies on external sandbox and resource configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured implementation of a sandboxed code runner, handling preparation, execution, input management, and cleanup. It securely manages temporary files, catches exceptions during subprocess execution, and cleans up files afterward. No malicious activity or suspicious behavior detected. There are no indicators of data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code's behavior appears consistent with legitimate execution management, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a secure, well-structured sandbox execution environment without evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not include any malicious or suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The overall security risk appears negligible.",
