  "conclusion": "The code in Report 3 demonstrates significant suspicious features such as obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting a malware score of 0.5 and a security risk of 0.7 for a balanced assessment. Other reports are consistent with their low suspicion levels. Vigilance is advised for code exhibiting these features, and further static/dynamic analysis is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
