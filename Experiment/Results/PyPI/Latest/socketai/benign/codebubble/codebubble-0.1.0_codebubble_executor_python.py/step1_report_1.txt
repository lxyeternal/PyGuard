{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python executor class that prepares a Python script to be run within a sandbox environment, primarily for secure execution of user-provided code.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from provided 'code' parameter; accessing sandbox configuration and workspace paths.",
  "sinks": "Writing code to a file in the workspace; constructing command-line arguments for executing Python within the sandbox.",
  "flows": "Code is written to 'main.py' in the workspace, then the command to run Python with the script is generated based on the sandbox configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network or system calls; no obfuscated or misleading code. Use of standard libraries and straightforward file and path handling.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Python execution environment by writing provided code to a file and preparing a command to run it inside a sandbox. It modifies sandbox configuration for executable paths, ensuring that the sandbox uses the specified Python interpreter. No network activity, no data leakage, and no malicious behavior are observed. The code appears to be part of a secure, controlled execution framework, with no signs of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for preparing and executing user code in a sandbox environment. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and designed for secure code execution.",
