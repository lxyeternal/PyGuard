{
  "purpose": "Defines a Python executor class that prepares and runs Python code within a sandbox environment.",
  "sources": "Input data source is the 'code' parameter provided to the prepare() method, which is written to a file.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to 'main.py' in the specified workspace; the command constructed executes the Python interpreter with this script inside the sandbox.",
  "flows": "Code input -> written to main.py -> command executed in sandbox environment using the interpreter path -> script runs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variables. Usage of standard libraries and safe file operations.",
  "analysis": "The script defines configuration classes and an executor that writes user-provided code to a file and then runs it inside a sandbox using a specified Python interpreter path. The code relies on external inputs (the 'code' parameter), but it does not process or execute untrusted data in an unsafe manner other than writing it to disk and executing it. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or malicious behavior is detected. The approach appears to be a standard sandboxed code execution setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard sandboxed Python code execution framework without any evident malicious behavior or security issues. It securely writes user code to a file and executes it inside a sandbox environment, with no signs of malicious intent.",
