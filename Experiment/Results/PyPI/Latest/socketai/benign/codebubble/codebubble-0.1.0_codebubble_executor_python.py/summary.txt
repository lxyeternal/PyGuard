  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation for sandboxed Python code execution. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. The overall security posture is low risk, primarily due to the nature of executing untrusted code, which is outside the scope of this implementation."
