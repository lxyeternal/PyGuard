  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign utility or data processing script with no malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Standard module imports, data handling functions, environment variables (if any), and input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Data output functions, network connections (if any), or file writes, none of which show suspicious activity.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., environment variables, function parameters) to output or processing functions, with no suspicious data exfiltration or malicious control flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal or standard in structure, with no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. Confidence is high (0.9) due to the clear benign description. No suspicious data flows or anomalies are present. The absence of malicious indicators and straightforward logic support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. Scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low risk score of 0.2 reflecting minimal potential concern due to limited context.",
