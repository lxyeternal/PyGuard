  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a basic Python script that performs some data processing or utility functions. No explicit application logic is evident from the visible code.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly shown, but the code may read from environment variables or files if present; none are clearly identified in the visible code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be network connections, file writes, or environment modifications if such code exists elsewhere in the full script. None are explicitly visible here.",
  "flows": "Data flow pathways are not explicitly shown; without further code, it's unclear if any source-to-sink flow exists.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls, in the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is either empty or insufficient to determine any malicious intent. It contains no imports, function calls, or data handling. Without additional code, no suspicious patterns or security issues can be identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the visible code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign or incomplete, and more context is needed for a definitive assessment.",
