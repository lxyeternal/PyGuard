{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided, but it appears to involve importing modules and possibly executing functions, likely related to data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules and potentially from environment variables or input parameters (though not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include any functions that execute code, write data, or send data over the network. Without explicit functions shown, no definitive sink is identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source points (such as input, environment variables, or imported modules) to sinks where actions are performed (like execution, output, or network transmission). The explicit flow path is unclear due to lack of detailed code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are detected in the provided code snippet. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs. It imports standard modules and possibly defines functions or executes code, but no malicious patterns such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The absence of explicit input handling or data output reduces suspicion, but the limited scope restricts comprehensive analysis.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with no suspicious activity detected. However, the analysis is limited by the brevity of the provided snippet.",
