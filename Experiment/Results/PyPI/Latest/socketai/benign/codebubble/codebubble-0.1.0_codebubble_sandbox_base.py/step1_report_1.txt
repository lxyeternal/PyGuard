  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class and configuration for a sandbox environment to run code securely.",
  "sources": "import statements, class attribute assignments, method parameters",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is written to external systems, network, or files based on untrusted input within this code segment",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code is primarily class and method definitions without data flow implementations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is standard for sandbox setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, defines configuration dataclass with default paths, and an abstract sandbox class with methods to reset workspace and abstract methods for command wrapping and result making. There are no hardcoded secrets, external data reads, or suspicious behaviors. The class design appears typical for sandbox environment setup. No data leaks, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present. The code is primarily structural and does not execute or manipulate untrusted data here.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup for a sandbox environment without any malicious intent or security risks. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior, and no external data leaks are evident.",
