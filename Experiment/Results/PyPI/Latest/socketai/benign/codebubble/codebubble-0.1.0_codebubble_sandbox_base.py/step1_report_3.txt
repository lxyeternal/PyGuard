  "purpose": "Define a base configuration and abstract class for sandbox environments used to execute code securely.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath, os.path.exists, shutil.rmtree, os.makedirs, imports from codebubble.utils",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly handle untrusted input or perform data leaks. The code mainly manipulates file paths and directory structures.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious intent detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up sandbox configurations and provides an abstract base class with methods for resetting the workspace and defining command wrapping and result creation. It relies on standard library functions for file system management and abstract methods for custom behavior. No input handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing present. No obfuscation or malicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, safe setup for sandboxing in a controlled environment. No malicious or security-compromising behavior detected.",
