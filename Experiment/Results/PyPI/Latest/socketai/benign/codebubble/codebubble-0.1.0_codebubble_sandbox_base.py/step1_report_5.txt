{
  "purpose": "Defines a base class for a sandbox environment used to execute code securely with resource limits.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (shutil, os, dataclasses, abc, typing) and a local utility module 'codebubble.utils'.",
  "sinks": "None; no direct data sinks or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input; the class primarily manages filesystem paths and command wrapping logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a sandbox configuration and abstract class, handling workspace directory setup and defining methods for command wrapping and execution result creation. It imports necessary modules and sets up data structures without executing any commands or processing external input. No embedded malicious logic, backdoors, or malicious data handling is present. The code appears to be a standard setup for sandbox management with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup for a sandbox environment with no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
