  "purpose": "Defines configuration and abstract base class for sandbox environment setup and management.",
  "sources": "Filesystem operations such as os.path.abspath, shutil.rmtree, os.makedirs, and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or command execution present; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Configuration attributes used in directory management; abstract methods intended for command wrapping and result creation, but not implemented here.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structural setup for a sandbox environment, involving directory management and abstract method definitions. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute commands directly. The code is straightforward, using standard libraries, and contains no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The reported scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are consistent with the benign and minimal nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard foundation for sandbox configuration with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
