  "purpose": "A file indexing utility that manages source directories, indexes files with specific extensions, and retrieves or filters note IDs.",
  "sources": "Reads directory paths via Path objects, accesses files via rglob, and filters note IDs based on string queries.",
  "sinks": "Returns file paths from internal notes dictionary, filters note IDs in list_notes.",
  "flows": "Source: directory paths and file system traversal; Sink: get_note_path returns file paths, list_notes filters IDs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, external network activity, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, using standard libraries for filesystem traversal and string filtering. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network communication, or handle untrusted user input beyond directory paths and simple string filtering. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The logging is benign, and the functions serve their intended purpose securely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured file indexing utility with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to filesystem access, which is inherent to its purpose. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The security risk score can be conservatively estimated at around 0.1, reflecting the filesystem operations but no actual vulnerabilities.",
