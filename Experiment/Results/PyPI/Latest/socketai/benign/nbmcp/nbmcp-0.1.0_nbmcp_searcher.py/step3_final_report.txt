{
  "purpose": "Provides search functionality over note files using external tools (ripgrep or grep) with fallback to in-memory string search.",
  "sources": "External commands invoked via sh.bake with user-controlled input; file reads for fallback search.",
  "sinks": "Shell commands executed with user input parameters; no direct data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "User query flows into external command arguments; command output parsed into results; fallback reads file content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected. External commands are parameterized to prevent injection.",
  "analysis": "The code uses sh.bake to safely run ripgrep and grep with user input, mitigating command injection risks. It handles errors gracefully and reads files directly for fallback. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The search results are parsed carefully, and the overall structure is transparent and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is secure, well-structured, and performs legitimate search functions without malicious intent. The scores assigned in the original reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified given the controlled external command execution and safe fallback methods.",
