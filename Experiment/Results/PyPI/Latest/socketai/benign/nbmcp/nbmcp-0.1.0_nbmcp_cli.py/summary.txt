  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free from malicious intent or security flaws. The low malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are justified. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), mainly due to external dependencies and server setup, but no direct vulnerabilities are apparent."
