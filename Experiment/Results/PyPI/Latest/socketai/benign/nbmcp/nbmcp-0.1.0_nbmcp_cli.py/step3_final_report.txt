  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for setting up and running a notes server, managing directories and indexing notes.",
  "sources": "User input directories, file extension options, server name option",
  "sinks": "NotesServer methods (add_notes_dir, index_notes, run), logging outputs",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> server setup functions -> server run method",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI application utilizing standard libraries and external server class. It performs input validation, asynchronous setup, and server execution with proper error handling. No malicious patterns, code injection, or obfuscation are present. External server class usage is controlled and appears benign. The logging and validation are appropriate, and no dangerous data flows are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free from malicious intent or security flaws. The low malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are justified. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), mainly due to external dependencies and server setup, but no direct vulnerabilities are apparent.",
