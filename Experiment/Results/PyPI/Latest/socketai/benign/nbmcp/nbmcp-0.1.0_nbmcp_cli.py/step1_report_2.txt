  "purpose": "CLI tool for managing and running a notes server with directory indexing and note indexing features.",
  "sources": "Input directories from command-line arguments, environment variables, user input through command options.",
  "sinks": "Logging functions, asyncio event loop, server methods (add_notes_dir, index_notes, run).",
  "flows": "User provides directories -> app processes options -> setup_server adds directories and indexes notes -> server runs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily orchestrates server setup via command-line inputs and manages asynchronous indexing tasks. It uses standard libraries (os, sys, asyncio), third-party libraries (typer, minlog), and custom server logic. Input validation appears appropriate, with error handling and logging. No evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands. No hardcoded secrets or network calls to suspicious domains are observed. The code is structured and straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI wrapper for a notes server, managing directory indexing and server operation without any malicious intent. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
