  "purpose": "A Python-based notes server managing indexing, searching, reading, and user prompts for note interaction.",
  "sources": "Filesystem directories, note IDs, user queries, context objects",
  "sinks": "Note content retrieval, note listing, prompt generation, resource responses",
  "flows": "Filesystem paths and user inputs flow into indexing/searching functions; outputs are note data, prompts, and resource info",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, asynchronous Python server that manages notes via filesystem operations, resource registration, and prompt creation. It performs local file indexing, note retrieval, and user interaction without external network calls or dynamic code execution. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. Data flows are confined to local filesystem and user inputs, with outputs being safe note contents and prompts. The code employs standard Python practices and maintains clear logic, indicating low risk and no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation of a notes management server with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), justified by filesystem operations and user input handling. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
