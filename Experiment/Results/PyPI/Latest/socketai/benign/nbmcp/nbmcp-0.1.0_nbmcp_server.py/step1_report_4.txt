{
  "purpose": "The code implements a notes management server using the FastMCP framework, providing tools, resources, and prompts for note searching, listing, reading, and analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters (e.g., query, note_id, dir_path), environment variables are not explicitly used, and file system interactions occur during indexing with Path and rglob. No external network input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include returning note contents, listing notes, and responding to prompts, but these are internal data processing and output functions. There are no direct sinks that send untrusted data externally or perform system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs (queries, note_ids, directory paths) to internal functions like search, read, and index, then back to the user as outputs or responses. No untrusted data appears to be processed in insecure ways or combined with system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are present. The code uses standard library features, and all functions seem straightforward and intended for note management. No suspicious behaviors such as network exfiltration, privilege escalation, or hidden code are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an asynchronous context for managing note indices and searchers, registers tools, resources, and prompts for note operations, and includes functions for adding directories, indexing files, and running the server. All file operations utilize Path and rglob for filesystem traversal without executing untrusted code. No external network interactions, command executions, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a typical implementation for a note management server with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign server implementation for managing and querying notes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. It appears safe and aligned with its apparent purpose.",
