  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Actual Presence of Issues**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code snippet is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, logic, or data flows. The code is minimal and standard for package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- No report claims the presence of malicious code or potential vulnerabilities, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- All reports assign `malware` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `securityRisk` = 0, which is appropriate given the code.  \n- The confidence scores are 1, indicating certainty, which is reasonable.  \n- The scores are consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Justification**  \n- Since the code only assigns a version string, there is no reason to assign any risk higher than 0.  \n- The malware score is correctly 0; there's no malicious activity.  \n- The obfuscated score is 0, as there's no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.  \n- The overall security risk is 0, as the code is harmless.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions or Claims**  \n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.  \n- No claims about vulnerabilities are made that are based on assumptions; the analysis is straightforward.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Analysis**  \n- The scores align well with the analysis provided in each report.\n\n**Final Estimation:**  \nGiven the simplicity of the code, I concur with the assessments:  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThere is no evidence or reason to consider any higher scores for malware or security risk. The code is standard, harmless, and unremarkable.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code snippet is a typical version declaration with no security concerns. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
