  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It contains no inputs, outputs, data flows, or suspicious constructs. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The code is benign, standard, and minimal, with scores reflecting no malware, obfuscation, or security risk. Confidence in benign nature is high (1).",
