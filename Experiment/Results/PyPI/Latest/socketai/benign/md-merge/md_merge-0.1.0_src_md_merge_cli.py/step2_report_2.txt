  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their findings with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states that the script is a CLI wrapper around merging functions, with proper validation and error handling. No malicious behaviors or malware signals are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** The report's high confidence (0.9) is justified; no suspicious code or behavior is identified.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard CLI behavior, input validation, and external module reliance. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The high confidence (0.9) aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Notes the use of uuid4() for filename generation but clarifies it's benign, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem suitable.\n- **Justification:** The use of uuid4() is standard and not suspicious; no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Highlights that input paths are passed to external modules without sanitization but notes no malicious behavior within this script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are reasonable.\n- **Justification:** Since the core merging logic is in external modules (not shown), the risk depends on their implementation, but within this script, no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to others, emphasizes standard CLI flow, no suspicious code, and safe use of uuid4().\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are consistent.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malware or obfuscation; the lower security risk score reflects the benign code.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward, readable code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal concern, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behaviors.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — low, consistent with the code.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The use of `uuid4()` for filename generation is standard and not malicious, though it could potentially cause filename collisions if not managed carefully, but this does not impact security.\n- The external modules (`md_merge.file_handler`, `merger`) are not shown; their security depends on their implementation, but based on this wrapper, no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Final verdict:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|----------------|-------------------|------------|\n| **0**          | **0**             | **0.1**    |\n\nThis assessment is consistent with all reports and the code analysis.",
