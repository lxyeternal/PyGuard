  "purpose": "Defines a command-line interface for merging Markdown files, handling input files, directories, and output paths.",
  "sources": "User-supplied file paths via positional arguments, directory paths via '--dir' option, and output path via '--output' option.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily processes file paths and calls external functions for merging; no direct data sinks or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input paths from user -> validation functions -> merging functions -> output file path, with no data flowing to external systems or networks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. Use of UUID for filename is standard and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script validates inputs, sets up logging, and calls external modules for merging. It handles exceptions appropriately. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious network activity is evident. No obfuscated code or malicious backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI wrapper around Markdown merging functions, with proper validation and error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent or malware within this module.",
