  "purpose": "A CLI tool to merge multiple Markdown files into a single document, accepting files or directory input, with output file generation and logging.",
  "sources": "User-provided file paths, directory path, verbose flag",
  "sinks": "External modules for merging, output file creation, logging outputs",
  "flows": "Input paths from user → validation functions → external merge functions → output file",
  "anomalies": "Use of uuid4() for filename (benign), reliance on external modules (assumed safe), no suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that validates inputs, handles errors, and calls external modules for merging Markdown files. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of uuid4() for filename generation is standard and unlikely to cause issues. Error handling is comprehensive, and logging is appropriately configured. External modules are assumed safe, and no network activity or secret data handling is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, safe CLI utility for Markdown merging with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The overall security posture is very low risk, with minor considerations regarding filename collisions which are benign.",
