  "purpose": "CLI tool for merging Markdown files, either via specified files or directory input.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include command line arguments (files, directory), environment variables (not used here), and file system reads for paths and directory contents.",
  "sinks": "File system writes to output path; logs to logging handlers; potential exposure if logging outputs sensitive data (but here logs are limited to info/error messages).",
  "flows": "User provides file paths or directory; code validates inputs; finds files in directory if specified; merges files; outputs merged file to specified path.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious dynamic code execution; no obfuscated code features; no network calls or external data transmission present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard CLI argument parsing and input validation, relying on external modules for core functionality. It carefully handles errors and logs progress. No malicious code patterns or backdoors are apparent. The use of uuid4 for generating output filenames is standard and safe. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected in the code flow or dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured CLI utility for file merging with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs input validation and error handling appropriately. There are no indicators of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
