{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to invoke the main function from the md_merge.cli module when executed as a script.",
  "sources": "The code reads the '__main__' execution context, which is standard for script entry points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there is no processing of untrusted input or data output.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the script execution to calling 'main()' in the imported module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the main function from a module and executes it if the script is run directly. There are no hardcoded secrets, external data reads, or unsafe operations visible. The simplicity indicates standard script entry point behavior with no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward script that delegates execution to an imported main function. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code fragment.",
