  "purpose": "Entry point for executing the main function of the md_merge CLI application.",
  "sources": "The code imports the main function from the md_merge.cli module.",
  "sinks": "The call to main() is a sink where execution begins, but there are no untrusted data sources or outputs involved in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The import of main() flows directly into its invocation in the if __name__ == \"__main__\" block.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for a CLI entry point; no anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a main function from a module and executes it if the script is run directly. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. It simply acts as a bootstrap for the md_merge CLI tool.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign entry point for a CLI application with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
