  "purpose": "Minimal Python script acting as an entry point that imports and executes the main function from md_merge.cli.",
  "sources": "Import statement from md_merge.cli, specifically the main() function.",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() which may process inputs or perform actions depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "The script imports main() and calls it when run directly; data flow depends on md_merge.cli.main().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI entry point with no suspicious or malicious features. Its security implications depend entirely on the implementation of md_merge.cli.main(), which is not provided. The code is clear, minimal, and standard. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0 given the lack of inherent vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is simple and well-understood.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on external implementation details. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
