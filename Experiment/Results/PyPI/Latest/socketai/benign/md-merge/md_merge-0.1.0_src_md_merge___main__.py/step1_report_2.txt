{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point to run the main function from the md_merge.cli module, likely initiating a command-line interface process.",
  "sources": "The code imports the main function from md_merge.cli, which may involve reading command-line arguments or environment variables when executed.",
  "sinks": "The main function may perform actions based on input; potential sinks depend on the implementation within md_merge.cli but are not directly visible here.",
  "flows": "Execution flows from the import statement to the if __name__ == '__main__' block, then calls main(), which may process inputs and perform tasks within md_merge.cli.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no unusual or suspicious constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script acts as a simple entry point that imports and runs main() from md_merge.cli. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. Since the behavior of main() is unknown, potential risks depend on its implementation, but within this code snippet, there are no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward launcher for the main function of a CLI module. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks by itself; any potential issues would originate from the imported module, which is not visible here.",
