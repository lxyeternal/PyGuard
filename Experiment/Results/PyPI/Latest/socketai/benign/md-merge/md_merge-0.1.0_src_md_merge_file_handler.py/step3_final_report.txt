  "purpose": "Provides functions to find markdown files in a directory and validate input paths and files.",
  "sources": "directory.exists(), directory.is_dir(), directory.rglob('*.md'), file_path.exists(), file_path.is_file(), file_path.suffix",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "find_markdown_files() reads directory and file existence; validate_input_files() reads file paths; validate_input_directory() reads directory path.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in debug logging statement: references 'markdown_files' instead of 'md_files'. This could cause a runtime error if DEBUG logging is enabled.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard filesystem checks and searches for markdown files. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data leaks are present. The only issue is a typo in a debug log statement, which is a minor bug and does not introduce security risks. Exception handling and validation are correctly implemented. The code is straightforward and uses common patterns, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for markdown file handling with no malicious intent. The only concern is a minor typo that could cause a runtime error during debugging, but it does not impact security. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal operational risk due to the bug.",
