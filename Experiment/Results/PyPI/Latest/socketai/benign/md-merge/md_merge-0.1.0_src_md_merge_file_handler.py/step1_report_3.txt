  "purpose": "Provides functions for locating and validating markdown files and directories for file operations.",
  "sources": "Reads directory paths, file paths, and file existence checks.",
  "sinks": "None observed that could lead to data leaks or unsafe operations; primarily file system validation.",
  "flows": "Directory existence check -> File search with rglob -> Validation functions for input files and directories.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The only notable issue is a typo in the debug logging line where 'markdown_files' is referenced but the variable is 'md_files'.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard filesystem validation and search operations using Path methods. It raises custom exceptions for invalid directories or files, which are appropriate. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. No malicious behavior or malicious code patterns detected. The only minor anomaly is a typo in a debug statement that could cause a NameError if logging level includes DEBUG, but this does not pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, primarily focused on filesystem validation and search. No malicious intent or malicious code patterns are present. The typo is a minor bug that affects debugging but not security.",
