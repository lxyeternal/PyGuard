  "purpose": "Merge multiple Markdown files into a single document with metadata and separators.",
  "sources": "Reading file contents via Path.read_text() for each input path.",
  "sinks": "Writing the final merged content to an output file via Path.write_text().",
  "flows": "Source: file.read_text() → merge_content_parts accumulation → header + joined content → write_merged_output() → file.write_text().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code properly handles exceptions, and no suspicious external calls or obfuscated code are present. The use of templates for separator and header is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input Markdown files and concatenates their content with separators and metadata headers, then writes the result to a specified output file. All file operations include error handling, and no user input is directly executed or used in unsafe ways. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code does not contain obfuscated parts or malicious payloads. The logic appears standard for file merging functionality, with logging for debugging and monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a safe file merging operation without any signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It correctly manages file IO, handles exceptions, and uses templates securely. No malicious behavior or malware detected.",
