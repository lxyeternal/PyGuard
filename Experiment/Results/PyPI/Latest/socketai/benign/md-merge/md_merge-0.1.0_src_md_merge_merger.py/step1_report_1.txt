{
  "purpose": "The code merges multiple Markdown files into a single document, adding headers and separators for clarity.",
  "sources": "File content read from user-specified input paths using Path.read_text()",
  "sinks": "Final merged content written to the specified output file path via Path.write_text()",
  "flows": "Source: reading file content from input paths -> processing and concatenating content -> writing the final merged content to output path",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code, and no unusual behaviors detected. Use of templates for separators and headers appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard file I/O operations: reading files from disk, concatenating their contents with formatted headers and separators, and writing the result to disk. The use of exception handling covers file not found and read/write errors. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution are present. The code does not manipulate environment variables or execute untrusted code. All operations are standard for a file merging utility, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a straightforward Markdown file merger without any malicious behavior. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It appears safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.",
