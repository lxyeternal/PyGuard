  "purpose": "The code merges multiple Markdown files into a single document with headers and separators, generating a final output file.",
  "sources": "Reads input files specified by a list of Path objects, primarily through source_path.read_text()",
  "sinks": "Writes the merged content to an output file via output_path.write_text()",
  "flows": "Reads content from input files, appends separators and headers, then writes the combined content to the output file",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual control flow. No signs of obfuscated code. Usage of trusted libraries and standard Python functions.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward file reading, string formatting, and file writing operations. It constructs a header with timestamps and file counts, then concatenates the contents of multiple Markdown files with separators. Exception handling is implemented for common I/O errors. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious commands are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are detected. The code appears to serve a benign purpose, with well-contained logic and proper error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Markdown file merger with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads files, processes content, and writes output in a standard manner. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or supply chain attacks.",
