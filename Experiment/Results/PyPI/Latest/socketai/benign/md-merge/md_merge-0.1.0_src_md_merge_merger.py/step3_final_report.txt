{
  "purpose": "The code merges multiple Markdown files into a single document, adding headers and separators for clarity.",
  "sources": "Reads input files via Path.read_text() for each source path.",
  "sinks": "Writes the final merged content to the specified output path via Path.write_text().",
  "flows": "Source: reading file content; Sink: writing combined content; Flow: read file -> append separator and content -> assemble header -> write output.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'datetime.UTC', which is invalid; should be 'datetime.timezone.utc'. This is a syntax bug, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file I/O operations with exception handling. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The only technical issue is the incorrect timestamp line, which would cause a runtime error but does not indicate malicious intent. The code structure and logic are benign and typical for file merging utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Markdown file merger with a minor bug in timestamp generation. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The only correction needed is fixing the timestamp line to use 'datetime.timezone.utc'. The current security risk score should be 0, and malware/obfuscated scores are 0.",
