{
  "purpose": "Configure logging for the md-merge application, setting levels, formats, and providing a logger retrieval function.",
  "sources": "The function setup_logging reads the 'level' parameter; the code uses sys.stderr for output.",
  "sinks": "The StreamHandler outputs logs to sys.stderr; no untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'level' parameter flows into the logger configuration; logs are sent to stderr via the handler.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up Python logging by clearing existing handlers, configuring a formatter, attaching a StreamHandler to sys.stderr, and setting the logging level. It logs a debug message indicating initialization. No external data processing, network activity, or secrets are involved. The code follows best practices and contains no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign logging setup module with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is well-structured, safe, and aligns with all reports. No modifications are necessary.",
