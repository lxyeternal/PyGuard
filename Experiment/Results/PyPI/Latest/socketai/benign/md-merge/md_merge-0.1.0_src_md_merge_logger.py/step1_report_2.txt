  "purpose": "Configure logging for the md-merge application to set logging levels, formats, and handlers.",
  "sources": "The code reads the logging level parameter and configuration variables such as log_format and date_format. It also accesses sys.stderr to set up the StreamHandler.",
  "sinks": "The logger outputs log messages to sys.stderr. No untrusted input data is directly written or sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The function sets up logging configuration and then creates a logger instance. The flow is from function call to configuring handlers and setting levels, with no data flowing from external sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. The code appears standard and straightforward. It clears existing handlers to prevent duplicate logs, which is normal practice.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up logging configuration using standard Python logging practices. It accepts a logging level parameter, sets a formatter, and attaches a StreamHandler to sys.stderr. It clears existing handlers to prevent duplication and sets the root logger's level. It also creates a module logger and logs a debug message about the initialization. There are no hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, network connections, or data leaks. No anomalies or malicious code are detected. The code does not include any external inputs or outputs beyond standard logging setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging configuration module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical setup routines safely without external data injection or suspicious behavior.",
