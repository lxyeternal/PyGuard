{
  "purpose": "Configure logging for the md-merge application, setting logging levels and formats, and providing a function to initialize logging in other modules.",
  "sources": "Reads data from function parameters (level), environment (via sys), and potentially from imported modules (logging, sys).",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code outputs logs to stderr via a logging handler; no untrusted data is written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "The function uses the 'level' parameter to set the logger's level and outputs formatted logs to stderr, but does not process untrusted external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and adheres standard logging practices. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup function for logging configuration, clearing existing handlers to prevent duplication, setting log format and level, and attaching a StreamHandler to sys.stderr. It includes a debug statement indicating logging initialization. There are no dynamic code executions, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The logic is standard for logging setup in Python applications.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard logging configuration without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It safely initializes logging for the application, with no evident security risks or malicious intent.",
