  "purpose": "Configure logging settings for the md-merge application, including log format, level, and handlers.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'level' parameter, sys.stderr for output, and logging configuration functions.",
  "sinks": "Logging output directed to sys.stderr; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'level' flows into logger configuration; output logs are sent to stderr.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a standard logging configuration with customizable log levels, formats, and handlers. It clears existing handlers to prevent duplication, which is good practice. There are no embedded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no external data flows that could be malicious. The logger.debug statement is for debugging purposes but does not pose security risks. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward logging setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical logging configuration module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply initializes logging for the application in a safe and standard manner.",
