  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:  \n   The provided code solely defines a set of custom exception classes for error handling within the md-merge application. These classes inherit from the base `Exception` class or other custom exceptions, with descriptive docstrings. There are no executable statements, data processing, input/output operations, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:  \n   - No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behavior is present.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or network/system calls.\n   - The class hierarchy and structure are standard and straightforward.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign a risk score of 0, which is justified because the code is purely structural and contains no operational logic that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Analysis of Logical Flaws or Errors in the Reports**:  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a benign, standard pattern for defining custom exceptions.\n   - No overestimation of risk or malware is evident.\n   - The reasoning is sound: defining exception classes is a common, safe practice.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:  \n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent since the code is purely declarative.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made, which is appropriate.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation**:  \n   - The code is safe, standard, and contains no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n   - The detailed reasoning in the reports supports a conclusion of no security concern.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:  \n- Based on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assigned scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n- No changes are necessary; the reports are accurate and well-justified.\n\n**My own estimate** after this review:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the assessment that the code is purely structural, safe, and free of malicious intent.",
