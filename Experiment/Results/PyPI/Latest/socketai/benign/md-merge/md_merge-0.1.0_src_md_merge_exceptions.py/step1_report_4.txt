  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the md-merge application to handle specific error scenarios.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; exception class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input, as this code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class inheritance for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in Exception classes. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or system calls. The class hierarchy is standard, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or suspicious patterns. The content is purely structural and serves to categorize errors within the application, without any embedded malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for error handling within the md-merge application. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
