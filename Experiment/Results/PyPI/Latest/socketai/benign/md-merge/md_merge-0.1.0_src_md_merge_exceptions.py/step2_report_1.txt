  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, as well as evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward set of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No executable code, data handling, or external interactions are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The exception classes inherit from standard Python exceptions, with descriptive docstrings.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code only defines exception classes; there are no errors, flaws, or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Malware presence?**  \n  No. The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or hidden code.\n\n- **Security risks?**  \n  None. The code is purely structural, serving to categorize errors.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of each report:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n- **Purpose & Analysis:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions, with no data flow, external interactions, or malicious code.\n\n- **Anomalies & Suspicious Patterns:**  \n  None. All reports note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:**  \n  All conclude the code is safe, standard, and benign, with high confidence (1).\n\n- **Scores (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk):**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as a benign, structural pattern for error handling.\n- The assigned scores reflect the absence of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores for malware, obfuscated, securityRisk:**  \n  Should remain at 0, as there is no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Should be 0, since the code is purely structural with no operational or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and appropriate in their assessments. The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes, with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe current scoring and analysis are correct. No adjustments needed.",
