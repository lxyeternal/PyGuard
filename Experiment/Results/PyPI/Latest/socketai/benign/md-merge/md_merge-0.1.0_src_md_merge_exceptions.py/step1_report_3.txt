  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the md-merge application.",
  "sources": "No external data input; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behavior detected. The code is straightforward class inheritance for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from base Exception classes. It does not include any input handling, network communication, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The structure is standard and intentionally simple, serving only to categorize errors within the application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining error classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code, and the risk score is negligible.",
