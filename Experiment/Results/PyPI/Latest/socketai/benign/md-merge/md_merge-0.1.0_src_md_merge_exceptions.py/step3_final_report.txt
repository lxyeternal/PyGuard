  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the md-merge application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception with descriptive docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, external calls, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; purely class inheritance hierarchy.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from standard Python exceptions. There are no executable statements, data processing, or external interactions. The structure is straightforward and typical for error categorization. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is purely structural, serving error handling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or security-related issues. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
