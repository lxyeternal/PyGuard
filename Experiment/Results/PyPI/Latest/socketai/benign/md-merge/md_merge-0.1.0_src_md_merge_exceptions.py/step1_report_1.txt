  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the md-merge application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code; it only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of class definitions with no executable or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions related to file and validation errors in an application. It uses standard Python exception inheritance with no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or external data handling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward and serves a structural purpose without operational logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe and standard pattern for defining custom exceptions. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
