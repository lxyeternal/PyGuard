  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the md-merge application's error handling.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; code defines classes only.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions, with descriptive docstrings. There are no dynamic features, input handling, external data sources, or suspicious constructs. The structure is straightforward and conventional for error handling in Python. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code. No external network or file operations are performed.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only standard class definitions for custom exceptions related to the md-merge application, with no malicious or security-risk behavior present.",
