  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the md-merge application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; all classes are for exception definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions for custom exceptions. No data input, external calls, or potentially malicious constructs are present. The structure and content are typical for error handling in Python projects, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward declaration of custom exception classes for error handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
