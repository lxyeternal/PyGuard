  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code defines custom exception classes for error handling in the md-merge application.\n   - There are no data flows, input/output operations, external calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The classes inherit from standard Python exceptions and contain only docstrings describing their purpose.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no embedded payloads.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or network/file operations.\n   - The structure is straightforward and typical for error categorization.\n\n3. **Analysis Consistency**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is purely structural, with no signs of malicious intent.\n   - The confidence level is 1 across all reports, indicating certainty in the benign nature.\n   - Malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero, which aligns with the content.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - Since there's no malicious behavior, the malware score should remain at 0.\n   - The obfuscated score is correctly at 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is also 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a standard, safe pattern for defining custom exceptions.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- I agree with the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:\nThis code is a benign, well-structured set of exception class definitions with no security concerns.",
