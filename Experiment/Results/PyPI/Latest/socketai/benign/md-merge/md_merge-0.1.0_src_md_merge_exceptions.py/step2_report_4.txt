  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code solely defines custom exception classes for error handling within the md-merge application. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or external interactions. The classes inherit from base exceptions and serve a structural purpose.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**  \nNo report finds any anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code. The code is straightforward, with standard Python class inheritance and descriptive docstrings. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, dynamic code execution, or external data handling.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of any malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the clear, readable class definitions.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the lack of any security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n4. **Critical Evaluation of the Reports**  \nThe analysis and conclusions are consistent and reasonable. The code is standard for defining custom exceptions, and there's no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. The confidence level is high (1), and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n5. **Potential Improvements or Adjustments**  \nGiven the uniformity and correctness of the reports, no changes are necessary. The scores are appropriate, and the reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct; no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct; code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct; no security risks identified)\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the provided scores. The code is benign, well-structured, and serves its purpose without any security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are justified and appropriate.",
