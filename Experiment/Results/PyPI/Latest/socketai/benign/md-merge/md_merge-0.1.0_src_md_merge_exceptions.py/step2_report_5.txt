  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only defines custom exception classes for the md-merge application. There are no data flows, input/output operations, external calls, or executable logic. The code is purely structural, serving to categorize errors.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation**  \n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior are present in the code.  \n- The exception classes inherit straightforwardly from Python's Exception hierarchy, with no dynamic code, eval, or other potentially malicious constructs.\n\n3. **Errors or Flaws in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They all correctly conclude that the code is benign, with no security risks or malware.  \n- They appropriately note the absence of external data handling, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, justified because there are no vulnerabilities, no external interactions, and no malicious intent.\n\n5. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores**  \n- Since the code is purely class definitions with no operational logic, there is no reason to assign any higher risk scores.  \n- The code does not involve any hardcoded secrets, network calls, or other risky behaviors.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency and Confidence**  \n- All reports are consistent and correctly interpret the code.  \n- The confidence level is 1, which is justified.\n\n7. **Additional Considerations**  \n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the reports are accurate in their assessment.  \n- The purpose of the code is clear and standard for error handling.\n\n**Final Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI agree with the reports' assessments. No changes are necessary. The code is safe, benign, and serves its intended purpose effectively.",
