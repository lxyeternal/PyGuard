  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code snippet:\n\nOriginal Code:\n```python\nfrom .core import connect\n```\n\n**Assessment of the code:**\n- It's a standard relative import, importing `connect` from a local module named `core`.\n- No data processing, no code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- The code is minimal and appears to be part of a larger package.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** Correctly identifies this as a straightforward import with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Risk and malware scores:** Both zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high confidence)\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes minimalism and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.1 (very low), confidence = 0.8.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states no immediate security concern.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, notes the import is from a relative module, common in packages.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.1, confidence = 0.7.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, notes the import is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.1, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Identical to previous assessments, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, risk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports agree that this is a benign, straightforward import statement.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The risk and malware scores are all appropriately low (zero or near-zero).\n- Confidence levels are high, reflecting the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Code presence:** Confirmed that the code is just an import statement with no malicious content.\n- **Scores:** I agree with the given scores; no changes necessary.\n- **Risk assessment:** Since there's no malicious activity, malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk negligible.\n- **Additional context:** If further code is provided, a more comprehensive assessment could be performed, but based solely on this snippet, the conclusion is sound.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is benign and standard in Python packages.",
