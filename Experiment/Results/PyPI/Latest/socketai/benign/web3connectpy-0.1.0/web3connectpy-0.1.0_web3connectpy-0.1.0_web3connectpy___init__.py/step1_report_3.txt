{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'connect' function or object from a local module named 'core'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module, which may read module files or dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling or output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed within this snippet; potential use of 'connect' elsewhere is unknown.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import may be suspicious in some contexts but is common in package structure; no code execution or malicious pattern visible.",
  "analysis": "This code only contains a single import statement from a local module. It does not include any data input, output, or processing that could pose security risks. The import itself does not indicate malicious behavior. Without additional code, it is not possible to determine if the imported module or subsequent code introduces vulnerabilities or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a simple import statement within a package. Additional context would be necessary for further assessment.",
