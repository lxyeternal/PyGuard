  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a simple import statement: `from .core import connect`. No malicious behavior, data flow, or anomalies are evident.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None. The report correctly identifies this as a standard import.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. It’s reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No security concerns, no malicious activity, and the confidence is high (1).\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same import statement, minimal code, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The report notes a slight security risk (0.1) due to relative import, which is acceptable in package structures.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. The risk score seems to reflect minor concerns about relative imports, which is reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, just a standard import. The slight risk score is acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same import, no data flow or suspicious patterns.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The report assigns a slightly lower confidence (0.7) but still considers the import benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Consistent with the previous reports.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same import statement, no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The confidence is high (0.9), and the report correctly states that the code appears benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same import, straightforward, no anomalies.\n- **Errors or flaws:** Confidence is perfect (1), and the report states no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code snippet is a simple, benign import statement.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the content; no report indicates malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- The slight security risk score (0.1) for some reports is justified by the use of relative imports, which could be a minor concern in some contexts but not malicious.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports is justified; no need to increase it further.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the minor concern about relative imports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and well-reasoned. The code snippet is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
