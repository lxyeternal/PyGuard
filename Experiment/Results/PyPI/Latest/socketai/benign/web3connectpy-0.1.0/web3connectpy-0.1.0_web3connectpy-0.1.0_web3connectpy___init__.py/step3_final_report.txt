{
  "purpose": "The code performs a relative import of 'connect' from a local module named 'core', indicating modular package structure without any malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code simply imports a component.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import typical in Python packages. No data processing, code execution, or suspicious behavior is evident. The import is standard and benign. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware score 0, obfuscation score 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.1) due to the use of relative import, which is acceptable in package contexts. Confidence in benign assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign import statement with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate; no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
