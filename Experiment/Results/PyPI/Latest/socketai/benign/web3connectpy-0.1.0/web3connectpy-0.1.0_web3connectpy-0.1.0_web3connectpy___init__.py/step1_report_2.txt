  "purpose": "Import the 'connect' function or object from a local module named 'core'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.core'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'connect' from '.core', but no data flows are visible beyond this.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal; no suspicious or unusual behavior detected. The use of a relative import is standard, though it may be a concern if the package structure is unusual.",
  "analysis": "This is a single-line import statement importing 'connect' from a local module. There are no external inputs, no data manipulation, and no execution of untrusted code. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or secret handling are evident. The code is minimal and appears to be part of a larger project, but on its own, it poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious behavior detected. There are no anomalies or security concerns based on this snippet alone.",
