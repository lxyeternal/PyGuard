  "purpose": "Import the 'connect' function or object from the local 'core' module.",
  "sources": "The code imports a symbol from a local module named 'core'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only performs an import statement with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the import statement is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a component from a relative module, which is common in modular Python projects. No input handling, no data processing, and no suspicious operations are observed. Given just this line, there's no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The import could be benign or part of larger malicious intent, but on its own, it appears normal.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks based on this snippet alone.",
