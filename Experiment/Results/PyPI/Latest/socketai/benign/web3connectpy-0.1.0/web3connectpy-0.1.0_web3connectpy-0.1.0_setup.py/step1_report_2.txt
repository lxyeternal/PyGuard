  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'web3connectpy' to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for long description during setup.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leak points; no execution of untrusted code or data handling beyond reading the file.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content during package setup; no flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read 'README.md' without error handling; typical in setup scripts but not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for packaging a Python project. It imports 'setuptools', defines package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and dependencies. It reads the long description from a local file 'README.md'. There are no dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling present. The code does not contain any obfuscated logic or suspicious constructs. Overall, this appears to be a legitimate, straightforward setup script with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply configures package metadata and dependencies.",
