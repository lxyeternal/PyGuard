  "flows": "capture_screenshot() calls pyautogui.screenshot() -> saves to buffer -> returns bytes; get_screen_dimensions() calls pyautogui.size() -> returns screen dimensions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns detected. Use of standard libraries and functions for screenshot capture.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to capture screenshots and retrieve screen dimensions, relying solely on pyautogui and standard libraries. It does not contain any external input sources, network communication, or suspicious logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are apparent. The code performs straightforward operations for screen capture and info retrieval without involving any data exfiltration or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purposefully designed for screenshot management. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
