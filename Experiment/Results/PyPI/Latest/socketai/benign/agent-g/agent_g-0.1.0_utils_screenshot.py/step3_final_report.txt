  "purpose": "Utility class for capturing screenshots and retrieving screen dimensions using pyautogui.",
  "sources": "Reads system info via platform.system(), captures screenshots with pyautogui.screenshot(), retrieves screen size with pyautogui.size().",
  "sinks": "None; code interacts only with local system resources, no data leaks or external data flows.",
  "flows": "System info read from platform.system() -> screenshot captured via pyautogui.screenshot() -> screen dimensions obtained via pyautogui.size().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a screenshot utility. It uses standard libraries and pyautogui for local system interactions. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The code's purpose is benign, and the logic is clear and well-structured. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior and pose no security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign screenshot utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily theoretical if misused in malicious contexts, but the code itself is safe.",
