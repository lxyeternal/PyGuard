  "purpose": "Utility for capturing and managing screenshots using pyautogui",
  "sources": "Reads system information (platform.system()), captures screenshots, and retrieves screen dimensions via pyautogui",
  "sinks": "Potential use of screenshot data (bytes) that could be stored or transmitted; no explicit data sinks present",
  "flows": "Input: platform info, pyautogui functions -> Output: screenshot bytes, screen dimensions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. Code is straightforward, using common libraries and functions.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a ScreenshotManager class that captures screenshots and retrieves screen size information. It uses platform.system() to determine OS type and pyautogui for screenshot capture and size. All functions perform standard operations without any obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors. There are no suspicious data flows or malicious logic present. The code solely interacts with local system resources for legitimate screenshot purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for capturing screenshots and obtaining screen dimensions. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
