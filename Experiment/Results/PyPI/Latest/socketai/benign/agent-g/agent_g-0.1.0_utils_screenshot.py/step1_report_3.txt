  "purpose": "Utility class for capturing and managing screenshots using pyautogui.",
  "sources": "Reads platform information and uses pyautogui's screenshot and size functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses pyautogui's screenshot function to capture screen data; no other sinks.",
  "flows": "Reads system info from platform.system() and captures screen data, then returns image bytes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. No obfuscated code or malicious data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a screenshot manager that leverages pyautogui to take screenshots and obtain screen dimensions. It reads system platform info but does not use it maliciously or insecurely. The screenshot data is stored temporarily in memory and returned as bytes, which is standard practice. No external data is sent or received, no environment variables are insecurely used, and no suspicious logic or code injection is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for capturing screenshots and obtaining screen dimensions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
