  "purpose": "Utility class for capturing and managing screenshots, including functions to take screenshots and get screen dimensions.",
  "sources": "pyautogui.screenshot() and pyautogui.size() functions for capturing screenshots and retrieving screen size.",
  "sinks": "The captured screenshot bytes are returned as a bytes object; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code captures screenshot data using pyautogui and converts it into bytes, then returns it. No untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries (io, platform) and a common third-party library (pyautogui) for screenshot operations. Functions are straightforward, with no external inputs from untrusted sources or malicious data handling. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data exfiltration behaviors. The code is well-structured and clear in purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate screenshot capturing functions using pyautogui without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
