  "sources": "Reads screen information and captures screenshots via pyautogui.screenshot() and pyautogui.size().",
  "sinks": "Returns image data as bytes; no external data sinks or network connections present.",
  "flows": "Input is not explicitly taken from untrusted sources; functions access system screen information and generate images, then return byte data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a class for screenshot management, capturing screen images and dimensions via pyautogui. All operations are standard library calls with no external network or file system modifications beyond standard screenshot capture. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. The code performs benign system interactions only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward screenshot utility with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs expected functions using pyautogui without any suspicious behaviors.",
