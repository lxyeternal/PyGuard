{
  "purpose": "A Python API client for Google's Gemini API, handling text and optional image inputs, with secure API key management and response parsing.",
  "sources": "Retrieves API key from environment variable or constructor; reads input parameters (text, image bytes); makes HTTP POST request to API endpoint.",
  "sinks": "API request to external endpoint; response parsing; potential data leakage if API key is mishandled, but handled securely in code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (text, image bytes) are encoded and included in JSON payload; payload sent via requests.post; response received and parsed for content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages API keys, encodes images in base64, constructs JSON payloads correctly, and handles errors properly. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. Response parsing is direct with exception handling. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external API interaction, but the code follows best practices. No obfuscation or suspicious activity identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The security risk scores of approximately 0.1 to 0.2 are justified given external API communication, but overall, the code is safe and trustworthy.",
