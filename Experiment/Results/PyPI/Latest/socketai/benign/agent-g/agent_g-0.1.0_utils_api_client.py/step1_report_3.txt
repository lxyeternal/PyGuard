{
  "purpose": "A client for interacting with Google's Gemini API, generating text and optionally including images via base64 encoding.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'GEMINI_API_KEY' for API key; function input parameters for text, image bytes, temperature, and max output tokens.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to the Gemini API endpoint with payload containing prompt and image data; potential for leaking sensitive data if API key is exposed.",
  "flows": "API key sourced from environment variable or constructor input -> used in URL for request -> payload includes base64-encoded image data -> response processed to extract generated text.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; standard usage of environment variables, base64 encoding, and requests library. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns. No dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles API key retrieval, encoding images in base64, constructing API request payload, and processing responses. No evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. No suspicious network behavior beyond standard API communication. The use of environment variables for API keys aligns with best practices. The request and response handling appears straightforward and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client for Google's Gemini service with no malicious intent or suspicious activities. It handles inputs and API interaction securely and appropriately. No malware or security risks identified.",
