  "purpose": "Client for interacting with Google's Gemini API to generate content based on text and optional images.",
  "sources": "API key from environment variable or constructor argument; image bytes passed to generate_content method; HTTP response from requests.post call.",
  "sinks": "requests.post call to external API endpoint; response.json() parsing; potential exception raising.",
  "flows": "API key and optional image bytes flow into generate_content, which constructs a payload and makes an HTTP POST request to the external API. The response is then processed to extract text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The environment variable is used securely for API key. No data leakage, system manipulation, or malicious payloads are evident. Exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an API client using a provided or environment-sourced API key, encodes image data securely via base64, constructs a payload for the Gemini API, and sends an HTTP POST request. The response is parsed for the generated content. No malicious or suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious commands are present. It appears to be a standard API wrapper with appropriate error handling. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward API client for Google's Gemini service with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected functions securely and appropriately.",
