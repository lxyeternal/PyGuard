      "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.05) due to the CLI entry point, which is standard and not suspicious in this context."

      "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that reports 1 and 5 present moderate to high suspicion of malicious activity, warranting higher malware and risk scores. Reports 2, 3, and 4 are benign with appropriate low scores. The scores are consistent with the evidence and reasoning provided, with minor room for adjustment in report 1's malware score."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or obfuscation but relies on unsafe dynamic code execution with weak sanitization, posing a moderate security risk if used with untrusted input. The malware score should be 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.75, reflecting the danger of executing arbitrary code. Strengthening sanitization or avoiding exec() is recommended."
