{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'agent-g' with dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "User-specified metadata (author_email, url), and dependencies listed in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "Installation of dependencies and entry point 'gemini_agent.cli:main'.",
  "flows": "Installation dependencies may load external packages; the entry point may execute code upon invocation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and console entry points. No malicious code or backdoors are evident. The dependencies are common Python libraries, and the entry point references a CLI main function, which appears standard. No signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are present. Sensitive information like email and URL are publicly available but not malicious. Overall, the script follows typical packaging practices with no suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, standard for Python packaging, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
