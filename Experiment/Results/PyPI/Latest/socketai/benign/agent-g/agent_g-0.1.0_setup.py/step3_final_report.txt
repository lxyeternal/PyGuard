  "purpose": "A standard Python package setup script defining metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point for the 'agent-g' package.",
  "sources": "Package metadata fields, dependencies list, entry point 'gemini_agent.cli:main'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'gemini_agent.cli:main' when CLI is invoked; no untrusted data sources or external code execution within this script.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources; the setup process is static and configuration-only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; dependencies are common and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration using setuptools, with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. The entry point references a CLI function, which could execute code, but this is standard for CLI tools and not inherently malicious. The dependencies are typical for a GUI agent project. No hardcoded secrets or external data handling are present. The overall structure and content are consistent with benign package distribution scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.05) due to the CLI entry point, which is standard and not suspicious in this context.",
