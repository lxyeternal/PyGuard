{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project called 'agent-g'.",
  "sources": "Reading package dependencies from 'install_requires' list, reading metadata such as name, version, author info, and URL.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data leaks or untrusted data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted input data to sensitive functions; the code only specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious URLs, or unusual code structures detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies dependencies, package info, and entry points for command-line scripts. The dependencies and entry point are typical and do not indicate malicious intent. The author's email and URL are publicly accessible, and there are no signs of hidden or malicious code. The code is straightforward, with no unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. It does not contain any code that could be used for supply chain attacks or malicious payload delivery.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup configuration for a Python package with no detectable malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and typical for a public Python package.",
