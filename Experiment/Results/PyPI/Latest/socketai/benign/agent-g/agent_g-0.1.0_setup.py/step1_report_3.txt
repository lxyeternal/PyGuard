  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'agent-g', including dependencies, entry points, and metadata, to facilitate packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from setup arguments, such as package metadata, dependencies, and entry point specifications. No external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data; it primarily sets up package configuration without executing or handling runtime data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this script; it is purely configuration-oriented.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or unusual behavior are present. The code follows standard Python package setup practices without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package configuration. It specifies package details such as name, version, requirements, and entry points. All elements are typical for Python package setup. No dynamic code execution, environment variable use, or external data reading is observed. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python setup configuration for packaging and distribution. It appears benign with no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks.",
