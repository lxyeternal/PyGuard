  "sources": "Read package metadata, dependencies, author info, and URL from the setup configuration.",
  "fires": "None apparent; no untrusted data sources or user inputs are directly used in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; setup script is static.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. The email and URL are public info; no hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package info, dependencies, and CLI entry points. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed. Dependencies are common for GUI automation, HTTP requests, environment variable handling, image processing, and data validation, which align with a GUI agent project. No signals of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be legitimate and standard for package distribution. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
