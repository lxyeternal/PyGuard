{
  "purpose": "Provides GUI automation actions via pyautogui, executing arbitrary Python code snippets supplied as strings.",
  "sources": "Input code string passed to execute_python_action; code lines within the sanitized_code returned by _sanitize_code.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing sanitized_code; pyautogui functions (click, typewrite, hotkey) executing GUI actions.",
  "flows": "Input code -> sanitized_code (via _sanitize_code) -> exec() -> GUI actions or errors.",
  "anomalies": "Sanitization only comments out import statements not in allowed list; no validation of code content; potential bypass of sanitization; use of exec() on untrusted input.",
  "analysis": "The code executes arbitrary Python code via exec() with minimal sanitization, which only comments out disallowed import statements. No embedded malware or malicious payloads are present; the primary risk stems from executing untrusted code. The sanitization is weak and can be bypassed, posing a security concern if inputs are untrusted. The pyautogui functions are standard for GUI automation and do not indicate malicious intent by themselves. The malware score should be zero, as no malicious code exists; obfuscation is absent. The security risk is moderate (~0.75) due to the unsafe execution pattern. The overall threat is the potential for misuse if untrusted input is processed, not embedded malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or obfuscation but relies on unsafe dynamic code execution with weak sanitization, posing a moderate security risk if used with untrusted input. The malware score should be 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.75, reflecting the danger of executing arbitrary code. Strengthening sanitization or avoiding exec() is recommended.",
