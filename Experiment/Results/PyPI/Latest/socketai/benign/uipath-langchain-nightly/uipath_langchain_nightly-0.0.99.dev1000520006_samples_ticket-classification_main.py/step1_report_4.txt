{
  "purpose": "The code implements a support ticket classification workflow using a language model, including preparing input data, classifying tickets, waiting for human approval, and notifying the team.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from GraphInput (message, ticket_id, assignee), and from environment or external modules for logging, language models, and UIPath.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to external systems via the UiPath API, and outputs classification results, but no data leaks or unsafe data usage are explicitly evident.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from GraphInput to prepare_input, then to classify via LLM, optionally to wait_for_human for approval, then to notify_team for notification, ending at END.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard libraries and clear API calls. The only external API interaction is with UiPath and OpenAI, which are legitimate and well-understood. No obfuscated code or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code processes support tickets, classifies them using a language model, and interacts with external systems (UiPath and email notifications). The use of the LLM appears intended for classification; no data exfiltration or malicious payloads are present. The external API calls are standard. No hidden or suspicious code, such as dynamic code execution or data leaks, is evident. The structure follows a typical workflow pattern without unusual or dangerous logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate support ticket classification workflow with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses external APIs responsibly within the scope of support automation. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected based on the provided code.",
