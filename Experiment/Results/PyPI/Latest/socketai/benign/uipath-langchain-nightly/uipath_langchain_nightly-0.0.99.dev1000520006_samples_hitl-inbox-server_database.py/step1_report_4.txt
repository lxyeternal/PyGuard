  "purpose": "Setup of SQLAlchemy ORM for database interaction, configuring database URL and session.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'DATABASE_URL' for database connection string.",
  "sinks": "Database connection via create_engine; potential data leaks if DATABASE_URL is manipulated externally.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'DATABASE_URL' → create_engine → database connection.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of environment variable for database URL is standard; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes SQLAlchemy with a database URL obtained from an environment variable, defaulting to a local SQLite database. It configures the engine with thread safety settings for SQLite and sets up session management and base declarative class. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Usage of environment variables for configuration is common and secure if the environment is trusted. No code injection, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard database setup script for SQLAlchemy with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It properly uses environment variables for configuration, which is a best practice. There are no indicators of malware or security risks within this code snippet.",
