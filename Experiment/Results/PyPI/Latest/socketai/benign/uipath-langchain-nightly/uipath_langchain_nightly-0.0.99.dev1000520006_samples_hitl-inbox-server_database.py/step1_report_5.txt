  "purpose": "Establish database connection and ORM setup using SQLAlchemy",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'DATABASE_URL' for database connection string",
  "sinks": "Database engine creation and session configuration, which execute based on 'DATABASE_URL'",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'DATABASE_URL' flows into create_engine, influencing connection parameters",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable for database URL is common; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an SQLAlchemy engine with a database URL sourced from an environment variable, defaulting to a local SQLite database. It conditionally adds connection arguments for SQLite. No user input, untrusted data, or malicious code is present. The use of environment variables is standard practice for configuration security. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard database setup snippet with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appropriately uses environment variables for configuration, avoiding hardcoded secrets.",
