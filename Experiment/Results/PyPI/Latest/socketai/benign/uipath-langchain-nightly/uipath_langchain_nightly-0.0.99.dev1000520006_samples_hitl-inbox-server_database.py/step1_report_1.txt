  "sinks": "create_engine function for database connection; environment variable retrieval.",
  "flows": "Reading 'DATABASE_URL' from environment variable and passing it to create_engine.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable is standard; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports SQLAlchemy modules to configure an ORM. It retrieves the database URL from an environment variable with a default fallback to a local SQLite database. The engine is created with appropriate connection arguments, especially for SQLite. The sessionmaker and declarative base are set up for ORM usage. All operations are standard for setting up database connectivity and ORM base class, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard database setup snippet using SQLAlchemy, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
