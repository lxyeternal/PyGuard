  "flows": "Environment variable 'DATABASE_URL' -> create_engine -> engine -> sessionmaker -> SessionLocal",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup code with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports SQLAlchemy modules, retrieves 'DATABASE_URL' from environment with a default, creates an engine with special handling for SQLite, sets up sessionmaker, and defines a declarative base. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. Use of environment variables is standard but could be manipulated if environment is untrusted; however, this is common practice. No data leaks, code injection, or backdoors are detected. The code is a typical, safe database setup snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup for SQLAlchemy with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The use of environment variables is typical and not inherently risky, though it depends on environment trustworthiness. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code is safe for use.",
