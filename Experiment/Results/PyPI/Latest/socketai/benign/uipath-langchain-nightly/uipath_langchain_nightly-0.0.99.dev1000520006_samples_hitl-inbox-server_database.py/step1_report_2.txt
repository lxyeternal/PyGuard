  "purpose": "Set up a SQLAlchemy ORM connection to a database, with configuration based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "os.getenv('DATABASE_URL') to retrieve the database URL.",
  "sinks": "create_engine() to establish the database connection; sessionmaker() for session management.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'DATABASE_URL' -> create_engine() -> SessionLocal for database sessions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; use of environment variable for database URL is standard. No unusual code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary SQLAlchemy modules and os for environment variables. It retrieves the database URL from an environment variable with a default value pointing to a local SQLite database. It conditionally adds connect_args for SQLite databases to disable thread check. Creates an engine and a sessionmaker, then a declarative base. The code is standard for setting up database connectivity and does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup for database connection using SQLAlchemy with environment-based configuration. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
