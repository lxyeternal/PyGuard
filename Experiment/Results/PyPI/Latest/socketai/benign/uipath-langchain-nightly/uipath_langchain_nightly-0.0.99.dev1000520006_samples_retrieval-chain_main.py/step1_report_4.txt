{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates the use of ContextGroundingVectorStore with LangChain to perform semantic searches and answer queries based on retrieved documents.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables loaded via dotenv, user-provided command-line arguments, and the internal vector store query functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing to the console, invoking the language model with user queries, and retrieving documents from the vector store.",
  "flows": "Input data (command-line args, environment variables, user query) flows into the vector store and language model; retrieved documents are processed and displayed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are detected. Usage of environment variables is standard for configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script uses open-source libraries and standard API calls for vector similarity search, prompt templating, and language model invocation. No data leakage or malicious code is evident. The code performs typical data retrieval and language model querying functions, with proper use of asynchronous functions. No external network connections or sensitive data manipulations are detected that would indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate example of semantic search and question-answering using LangChain and a vector store. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk score is very low.",
