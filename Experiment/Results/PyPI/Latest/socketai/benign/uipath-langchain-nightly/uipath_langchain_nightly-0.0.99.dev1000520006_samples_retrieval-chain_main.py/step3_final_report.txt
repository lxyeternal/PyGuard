  "purpose": "This code demonstrates the use of the ContextGroundingVectorStore class with LangChain for document retrieval and question answering.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input query, vector store retrieval functions, external language model API calls.",
  "sinks": "Console output of retrieved documents, answers, and source metadata.",
  "flows": "Input query from user -> vector store similarity search -> retrieval chain with prompt and model -> output answer and source documents.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a retrieval-augmented QA system using well-known libraries and practices. It loads environment variables, performs similarity searches, constructs a retrieval chain with a prompt and language model, and outputs results. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code and standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, legitimate, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware score is correctly set to zero. Overall, the code poses minimal security concern.",
