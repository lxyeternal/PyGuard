{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for job processing, messaging, and feedback using Pydantic for validation and ORM configuration.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; models define schema fields for API requests and responses.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; models are purely declarative data schemas with no data processing or external calls.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; models serve as validation schemas only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code contains only standard Pydantic model definitions, no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of declarative Pydantic models for API validation and ORM configuration. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or embedded secrets. The models include optional fields, nested models, and ORM mode, all standard practices. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified based on the code's static, benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard, benign Pydantic models used for data validation in an API context. There are no indications of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.",
