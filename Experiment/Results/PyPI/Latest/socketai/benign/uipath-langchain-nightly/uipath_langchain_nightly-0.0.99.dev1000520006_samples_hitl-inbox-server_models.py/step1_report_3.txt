  "purpose": "Define database models for 'jobs' and 'inbox_messages' tables using SQLAlchemy ORM.",
  "sources": "Imported modules: sqlalchemy, database, datetime.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or external communications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from database input fields to class attributes; no external or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation detected. No backdoors or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two ORM models with standard SQLAlchemy syntax. Fields are basic data types; default timestamps use datetime.now. Relationships are standard. No dynamic code execution, no external data transmission, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious logic observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward ORM model definition with no malicious or security issues detected. It is well-structured and does not exhibit suspicious behavior.",
