  "purpose": "Define database models for 'jobs' and 'inbox_messages' tables using SQLAlchemy ORM.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; data is stored in database fields and default timestamps.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or external system interaction present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; data flows from input to database storage via ORM, no external or untrusted data flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. Use of default datetime.now is typical but could be a minor concern if used for security-sensitive timestamps.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two ORM models with columns for IDs, status, timestamps, and relationships. No user input handling, no code injection, no environment variable use, and no external system communication. No signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or malicious behavior. The models are straightforward and typical for tracking jobs and messages.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of database models for job and message tracking without any malicious intent or security risks. There are no suspicious behaviors or anomalies. The security risk is minimal.",
