  "purpose": "Define ORM models for 'jobs' and 'inbox_messages' tables with relationships and timestamp fields.",
  "sources": "Imports from sqlalchemy, database.Base, datetime.now for default timestamps.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external system interactions; standard ORM column definitions.",
  "flows": "Class definitions instantiate columns and relationships; no external data flow or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of datetime.now as default timestamp; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two ORM models with proper relationships and data types. No malicious code, network calls, or obfuscation are present. The use of datetime.now for default timestamps is common but could be improved for timezone awareness; however, it does not introduce security risks. The models are straightforward, with no signs of sabotage or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure ORM schema with no malicious or suspicious elements. The low security risk score is justified. No modifications are necessary.",
