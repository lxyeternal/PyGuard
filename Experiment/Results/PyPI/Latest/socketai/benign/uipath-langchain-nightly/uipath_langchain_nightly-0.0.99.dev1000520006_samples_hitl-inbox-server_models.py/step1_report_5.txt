  "purpose": "Define database models for job tracking and messaging system using SQLAlchemy ORM.",
  "sources": "Import statements for SQLAlchemy modules, datetime module, and database Base class; class attributes for columns and relationships.",
  "sinks": "Database interactions through SQLAlchemy ORM, which are generally safe; no explicit data sinks for untrusted input identified.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., job and message details) flows from user inputs or external sources into model instances, then into database sessions; no external data processing or network communication present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated or malicious code behavior observed. No use of insecure functions or environment variables. Relationships and column definitions appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two ORM classes, Job and InboxMessage, mapping to database tables. Columns are typed appropriately with nullable settings and default values. Relationships are set up correctly. No dynamic code execution, no network calls, and no apparent data leaks or malicious logic. The code is straightforward schema definitions with no suspicious behavior or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard SQLAlchemy ORM model definition for managing job and message data. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and well-structured.",
