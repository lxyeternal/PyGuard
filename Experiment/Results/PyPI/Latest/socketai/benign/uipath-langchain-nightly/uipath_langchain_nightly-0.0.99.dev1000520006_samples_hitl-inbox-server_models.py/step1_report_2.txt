  "purpose": "Define database models for 'jobs' and 'inbox_messages' tables using SQLAlchemy ORM.",
  "sources": "Import statements for SQLAlchemy modules and 'datetime'. Class attributes that define table columns.",
  "sinks": "Database interactions via ORM; no direct untrusted data sinks identified in this code.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., 'content', 'status') mapped to database columns; no explicit flow to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'datetime.now' as default value could lead to issues if not properly configured, but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes ORM models with columns for job and message data, using standard SQLAlchemy syntax. No code execution, network calls, or data leakage mechanisms are present. No input sanitization or handling vulnerabilities are evident, but also no malicious intent. The code appears to be straightforward data model definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard ORM model definitions without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include any suspicious or harmful logic, backdoors, or malicious data flows.",
