  "purpose": "Define database models for storing job and inbox message information using SQLAlchemy ORM.",
  "sources": "Imports from sqlalchemy, database connection, and datetime for default timestamps.",
  "sinks": "No explicit untrusted data sinks; code primarily defines data schemas and relationships.",
  "flows": "Data flows from potential external inputs into the database models via ORM operations, but no direct handling of untrusted input within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code straightforwardly defines models and relationships without dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines two ORM classes: Job and InboxMessage, with proper table names, primary keys, and relationships. It uses default datetime for timestamp columns, which is acceptable. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as network operations, dynamic code execution, or secret handling, are present. The code appears to be a typical ORM model setup for a database schema.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as standard database schema definitions without any malicious intent or security risks. No malware, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. It is a typical, secure implementation of ORM models.",
