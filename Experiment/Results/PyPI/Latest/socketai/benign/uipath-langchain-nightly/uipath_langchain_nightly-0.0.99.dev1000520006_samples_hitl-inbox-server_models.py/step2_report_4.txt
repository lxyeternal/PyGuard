  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward ORM model definitions with no malicious behaviors.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- The use of `datetime.now` as default timestamps is standard, though it could be a minor concern if used for security-sensitive purposes, but not malicious.\n- No external system interactions, network calls, or data leaks are present.\n- The code appears to be a typical implementation of database schema models for job and message tracking.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n\n1. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of any malicious activity or code.\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious code is present.\n\n2. **Obfuscated Score:**\n   - All reports assign 0, which is correct since the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n3. **Security Risk Score:**\n   - The scores range from 0.1 to 0.2 across reports.\n   - Given the code's nature—simple ORM models with no external interactions—these are reasonable.\n   - The slight elevation (0.1 or 0.2) may reflect minor concerns about the use of `datetime.now` as default timestamps, but these are standard practices and not security issues.\n\n**Potential Adjustments:**\n- The scores for malware and obfuscation are consistent and reasonable.\n- The small security risk scores are also justified, considering the use of default timestamps, but overall, the code is low risk.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a typical, secure ORM schema definition.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.\n- The risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to default timestamp usage, which is standard)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, secure implementation of database models with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
