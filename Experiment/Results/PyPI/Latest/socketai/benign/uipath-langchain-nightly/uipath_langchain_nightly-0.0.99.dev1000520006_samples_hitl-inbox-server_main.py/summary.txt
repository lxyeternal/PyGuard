  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured backend for managing UiPath automation jobs. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities. The minor security concern relates to logging practices, not malicious intent. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score of 0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
