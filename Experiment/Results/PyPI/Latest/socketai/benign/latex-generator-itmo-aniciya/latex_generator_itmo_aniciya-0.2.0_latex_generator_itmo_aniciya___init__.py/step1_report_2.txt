  "purpose": "This code imports functions generate_table and generate_image from a local module core and exposes them for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a local module (.core) within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present; this is just an import/export statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of imports and an __all__ declaration to specify exported symbols. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or system interactions. Since it only imports functions and exposes them, there are no apparent security risks, malicious behavior, or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages module exports.",
