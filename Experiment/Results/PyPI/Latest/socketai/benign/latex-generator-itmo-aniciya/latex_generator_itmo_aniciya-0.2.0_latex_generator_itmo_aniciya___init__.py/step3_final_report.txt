  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Import from .core to module namespace, then export via __all__",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export pattern with no suspicious or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from a local module and exposes them via __all__. It contains no data processing, network activity, or obfuscation. All reviews correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present. The code is a standard module export pattern, and the reports are accurate in their assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior or security risks. The existing reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
