{
  "purpose": "This module exports two functions, generate_table and generate_image, from the core submodule, likely for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports generate_table and generate_image from a local core module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data handling operations are present; no untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports functions and exports them; there are no data flows, input handling, or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from a local module and exposes them via __all__, indicating it functions as an interface or API. No data input, output, or processing occurs here. There are no signs of malicious code, external data handling, or obfuscation. The simplicity suggests it's a standard module export pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic module export with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It appears to be a benign part of a larger project, serving to expose functions from the core module.",
