{
  "purpose": "This code module exports two functions, generate_table and generate_image, from the core submodule for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions generate_table and generate_image from a relative module named .core.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code snippet as it does not handle untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only exports functions imported from another module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local core module and explicitly exports them via __all__. There are no suspicious or malicious activities such as network communication, data handling, or code execution. Its simplicity indicates it is a typical module for organizing and exposing functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as an export interface for functions from a core module. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues based on this snippet.",
