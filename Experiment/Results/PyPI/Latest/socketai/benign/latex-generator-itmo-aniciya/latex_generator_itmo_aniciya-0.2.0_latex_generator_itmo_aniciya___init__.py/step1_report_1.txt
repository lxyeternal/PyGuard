  "purpose": "The code exports functions generate_table and generate_image from the core module for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports generate_table and generate_image from the local core module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed; the code only exports functions without any data handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of an import statement and an __all__ declaration. It imports functions from a local module and specifies them for external access. There are no data inputs, no processing, no environment variables, and no network interactions. The simplicity indicates no malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module export statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely re-exports functions for external use, with no indications of obfuscation or malware.",
