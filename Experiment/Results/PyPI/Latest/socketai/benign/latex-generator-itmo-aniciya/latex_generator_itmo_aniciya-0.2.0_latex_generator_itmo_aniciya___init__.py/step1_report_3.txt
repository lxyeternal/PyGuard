  "purpose": "Export functions generate_table and generate_image from the core module",
  "sources": "Import statement from .core module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output functions",
  "flows": "N/A — only imports and exports without data flow logic",
  "anomalies": "Absence of data handling, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code structures",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module that imports two functions from a local core module and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no data input, processing, or output logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscated code. The module appears to be a straightforward re-export of functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves solely to re-export functions from a local module. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
