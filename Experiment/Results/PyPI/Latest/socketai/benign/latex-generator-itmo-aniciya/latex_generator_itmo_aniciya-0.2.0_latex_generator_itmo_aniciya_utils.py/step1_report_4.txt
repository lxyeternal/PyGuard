  "purpose": "Retrieve current user's username and the current date",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('USER', 'USERNAME', 'LOGNAME')",
  "sinks": "None (no output of untrusted data beyond return statements)",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> get_username() -> return value; date.today() -> return value",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, straightforward environment variable access and date formatting",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: get_username() retrieves user identity info from environment variables, and get_date() returns the current date. Both functions are simple, do not execute external commands, nor do they process untrusted input beyond reading environment variables. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity observed. No indication of obfuscation or malware. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply retrieves system environment info and current date.",
