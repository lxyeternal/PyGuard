  "purpose": "Retrieve the current user's username and the current date.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: 'USER', 'USERNAME', 'LOGNAME'.",
  "sinks": "Return statements providing username and date; no data is sent externally or stored.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read to determine username; date is obtained from system clock and formatted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No use of untrusted input beyond environment variables, which are common for such tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to fetch environment variables for username and the current date. It uses standard library functions and environment variables that are typically safe and non-malicious. There are no indications of data leaks, malicious network activity, or obfuscated code. The environment variables used are standard for obtaining user info, and date retrieval is straightforward. No suspicious behavior or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and performs benign operations to fetch user information and date. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
