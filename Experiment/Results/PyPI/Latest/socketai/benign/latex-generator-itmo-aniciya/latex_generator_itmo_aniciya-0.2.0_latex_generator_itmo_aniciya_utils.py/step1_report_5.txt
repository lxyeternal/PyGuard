  "purpose": "Retrieve the current user's username and the current date.",
  "sources": "os.getenv('USER'), os.getenv('USERNAME'), os.getenv('LOGNAME')",
  "sinks": "return statements that output username and date",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables flows into return statements for username; system date flow into return statement for date",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious behavior, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses environment variables to obtain the username, which is standard practice. The use of os.getenv for reading environment variables is safe. The date retrieval uses standard library functions without any dynamic execution or external input. No code injection, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code is simple, straightforward, and does not include obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for obtaining username and date. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
