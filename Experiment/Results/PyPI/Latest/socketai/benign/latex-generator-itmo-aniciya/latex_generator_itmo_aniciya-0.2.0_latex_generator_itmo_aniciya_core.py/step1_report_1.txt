{
  "purpose": "The code generates LaTeX documents containing either a table or an image, using input data and filename.",
  "sources": "The code reads system-generated data such as date and username via get_date() and get_username(), and takes filename input for images.",
  "sinks": "The filename input is used to generate image paths in LaTeX documents; get_date() and get_username() likely access system or environment data.",
  "flows": "Input filename flows into generate_image() to create a path in LaTeX; get_date() and get_username() provide metadata; data flows into LaTeX templates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code structures are detected. The code only reads system info and user input to generate documents.",
  "analysis": "The code imports OS for path handling, uses templates for LaTeX document generation, and reads system info via utility functions. The filename is processed to an absolute path and embedded into LaTeX content, which is a standard practice for document generation. No malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection, is present. The data flow is straightforward: input filenames lead to file path embedding, and system info is incorporated into document metadata. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for generating LaTeX documents with images or tables. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The only notable activity is processing filenames and system info for document content, which is typical for such applications.",
