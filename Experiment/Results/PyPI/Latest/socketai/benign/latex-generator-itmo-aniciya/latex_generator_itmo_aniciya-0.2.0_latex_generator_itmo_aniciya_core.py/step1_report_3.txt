{
  "purpose": "The code generates LaTeX documents with embedded tables and images using templates, incorporating user and date information from utility functions.",
  "sources": "User-provided filename in generate_image(), and get_date()/get_username() utility functions for metadata.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is directly used in sensitive operations like network access or system modification.",
  "flows": "Filename input flows into generate_image() and then into the TEMPLATE, but only used for file path insertion; get_date()/get_username() supply metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution or external network calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs LaTeX documents based on provided data, using standard template substitution. The filename input is sanitized to a path, but only used for file referencing. Utility functions for date and username are called, presumed to be safe. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign LaTeX document generator with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided code.",
