{
  "purpose": "The code generates LaTeX documents with either a table or an image embedded, based on input data or filenames.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information via get_date() and get_username() functions; it also reads filenames provided to generate_image().",
  "sinks": "The code constructs LaTeX documents and inserts paths and content into templates, primarily outputting LaTeX source code; no direct data leaks or system modification is evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from get_date() and get_username() functions into templates; filename input flows into os.path.abspath() and basename(), then into templates for output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The use of os.path.abspath() and filename manipulation appears standard; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries and functions to generate LaTeX documents with user and date info, as well as images and tables. No external data sources or untrusted inputs besides filenames are used. Templates are filled with sanitized paths and filenames, reducing risk of injection. The functions get_date() and get_username() are imported from utils but their implementations are unknown; however, they are used in a read-only context. The code does not perform network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe, performing straightforward LaTeX document generation without malicious intent or security risks. No evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities is present.",
