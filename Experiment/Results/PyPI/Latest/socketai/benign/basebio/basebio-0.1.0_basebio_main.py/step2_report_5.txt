  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code snippet is a minimal CLI wrapper built with Typer, importing a `run_command` function from a local module.\n   - No suspicious or malicious code constructs, obfuscation, or hardcoded credentials are present.\n   - The code itself is benign and standard for CLI applications.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n   - The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of `run_command`, which is not provided.\n   - The code is straightforward and free of anomalies.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code in the snippet.\n   - Security risk scores are low (~0.1–0.2), which seems reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n   - No adjustments needed based on the reports.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code itself does not contain any malicious logic, and the risk depends on `run_command`, which is external, a high risk score isn't justified unless `run_command` is known to be malicious.\n   - The current low scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code's benign appearance.\n   - No signs of malware are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly state that potential risks depend on the implementation of `run_command`.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about malicious behavior are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: low malware, low security risk, no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** Approximately 0.1–0.2 (low, contingent on `run_command`'s implementation)\n\n### Additional Recommendations:\n- To fully assess security, review the implementation of `run_command`. If it executes system commands with untrusted input or contains unsafe code, the risk could be higher.\n- As it stands, the code snippet is benign and appears to be a standard CLI wrapper.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward CLI setup with no malicious or suspicious elements. The risk and malware scores are appropriately low. The primary concern is the behavior of `run_command`, which cannot be evaluated here.",
