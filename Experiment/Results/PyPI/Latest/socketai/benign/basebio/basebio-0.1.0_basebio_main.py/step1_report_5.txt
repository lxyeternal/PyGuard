{
  "purpose": "Set up a command-line interface using Typer for bioinformatics tools, specifically including a command 'cmd' that runs an imported function.",
  "sources": "Import statements (typer, run_command from modules), command registration via app.command",
  "sinks": "run_command function execution, potential command-line input processing",
  "flows": "User invokes CLI -> Typer framework processes command -> run_command executes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external network calls, or obfuscated code observed. No evidence of malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Typer CLI application with a command 'cmd' linked to an external function run_command. The module docstring describes the package as bioinformatics-focused. The code structure appears standard for Typer applications. The run_command function's implementation is not provided here, so potential malicious behavior within that function cannot be assessed. The code does not include any suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, network operations, or hidden behaviors. It appears to be a straightforward CLI setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI setup using Typer with no evident malicious intent or security risks. The only concern depends on the implementation of run_command, which is not shown. Based on available information, there are no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
