  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI wrapper with no embedded malicious or suspicious logic. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the behavior of 'run_command', which is not provided. The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and a low risk score. No issues are evident in the code snippet itself."
