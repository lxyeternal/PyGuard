{
  "purpose": "A CLI application built with Typer that delegates command execution to an external function 'run_command' from a local module.",
  "sources": "Imports 'typer' and 'run_command' from a local module; reads no external input directly.",
  "sinks": "Potentially in 'run_command' if it executes system commands or handles untrusted input, but not evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The command 'cmd' triggers 'run_command'; data flow depends on 'run_command' implementation, which is not provided.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Typer CLI app with a command 'cmd' that calls 'run_command'. The implementation of 'run_command' is unknown, so security implications depend on its behavior. The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for CLI wrappers. All reports correctly identify that no malicious or suspicious patterns are visible. Malware scores are consistently zero, and risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code. The scores are justified given the lack of evidence of malicious activity and the external dependency. The primary concern remains the implementation of 'run_command', which is outside the scope of this snippet. Overall, the code appears safe, and the assessments are consistent and reasonable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI wrapper with no embedded malicious or suspicious logic. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the behavior of 'run_command', which is not provided. The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and a low risk score. No issues are evident in the code snippet itself.",
