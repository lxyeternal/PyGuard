  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `typer` and `run_command` from a local module.\n- Sets up a Typer CLI app with a command `cmd` that calls `run_command`.\n- Defines a callback with a description.\n- No suspicious or malicious code elements are visible.\n- The behavior of `run_command` is unknown, so potential risks depend on its implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies the CLI setup with `typer` and `run_command`.\n- **Analysis:** Appropriately notes that the code is benign and that risks depend on `run_command`.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which is reasonable.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, indicating low risk.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Sound. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, accurately describes the CLI structure.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent observed; standard setup.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1, very low.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly emphasizes that potential risks depend on `run_command`.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as others.\n- **Analysis:** Properly states that the code is a standard CLI wrapper with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Same understanding.\n- **Analysis:** Notes that risks depend on `run_command` and finds no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward CLI wrapper.\n- The main concern is the behavior of `run_command`, which is not provided.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious code in the snippet.\n- The risk scores are low, reflecting the minimal code shown.\n- Confidence levels are high, indicating that the reviewers are confident in their assessments.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- Since `run_command` is external and its implementation is unknown, the true risk hinges on what it does.\n- If `run_command` executes system commands with untrusted input, that could be a security concern, but this cannot be confirmed here.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — No evidence of malicious activity in the provided code.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** 0.2 — Slightly elevated due to reliance on external `run_command`, but the code itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard CLI setup using Typer.\n- No malicious or suspicious patterns are visible.\n- The main security consideration is the implementation of `run_command`.\n- The current scores are appropriate given the evidence.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese reflect a benign code snippet with potential, but unconfirmed, risks depending on external implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always review the implementation of `run_command` to ensure it handles inputs securely and does not execute untrusted commands.",
