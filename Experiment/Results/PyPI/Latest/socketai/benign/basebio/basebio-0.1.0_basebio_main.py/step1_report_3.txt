{
  "purpose": "The code defines a command-line interface (CLI) application using the Typer library, wrapping a function called run_command for execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the command-line input and imports modules, specifically the run_command function from a local module.",
  "sinks": "The run_command function may process untrusted input data, potentially leading to command execution or other effects depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Input data is taken via CLI, passed to run_command, which could potentially lead to execution of commands or other actions depending on run_command's internal implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code are present. The only imported function is run_command, whose behavior is unknown; potential risk depends on its implementation.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Typer CLI app with a command 'cmd' linked to run_command. The code includes a basic callback function with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main concern hinges on what run_command does; if run_command executes system commands or processes untrusted input without sanitization, that could be a security risk. However, the code snippet itself is standard CLI setup code, with no embedded malicious logic or suspicious patterns. The package is described as a bioinformatics tool, and there are no indications of malicious intent or sabotage within this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical CLI setup with no apparent malicious intent or security issues in the snippet itself. Potential risks are dependent on the implementation of run_command. Overall, the code appears benign, but caution should be exercised regarding run_command's internal logic.",
