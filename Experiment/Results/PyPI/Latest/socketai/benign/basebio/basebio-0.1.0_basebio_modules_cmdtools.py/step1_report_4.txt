{
  "purpose": "A command-line utility that runs user-specified shell commands, optionally using shell mode.",
  "sources": "Input source is the 'command' parameter provided via CLI, which can be a string or a list.",
  "targets": "The subprocess.run function executes the command, which can lead to command injection if untrusted input is used.",
  "flows": "Input 'command' flows into subprocess.run, with 'use_shell' determining if shell execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code accepts user input as a command to execute. It allows execution in shell mode or as a list, which is standard. The subprocess.run call executes the command directly, which is potentially dangerous if the input is untrusted, as it can lead to command injection vulnerabilities. The code includes error handling for subprocess.CalledProcessError and generic exceptions. No malicious code, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are detected. Overall, this is a typical command execution wrapper with inherent risks if used improperly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard command execution utility with potential command injection risk if untrusted input is used. No malicious behavior or sabotage evident. Security risk depends on input sanitization, which is not enforced here.",
