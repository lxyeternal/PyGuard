  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, file reads, user inputs, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded URLs/credentials, obfuscated segments.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, system commands, dynamic execution points.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input sources flow into eval/exec, network functions, or file operations; potential data exfiltration or code injection points.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted data, hardcoded strings, obfuscation patterns, complex or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns such as dynamic code execution and obfuscation, which are suspicious. No explicit malicious payloads or backdoors are detected. The use of eval/exec with untrusted input is a significant concern, increasing the security risk. The obfuscation is minimal but present, and no hardcoded secrets are identified. The overall behavior suggests moderate suspicion but not confirmed malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows potential security concerns primarily due to dynamic execution and obfuscation, but lacks definitive malicious payloads. The risk level is moderate, warranting cautious use and further review if more code details are available.",
