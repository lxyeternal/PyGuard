      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that Report 1's high malware (0.75), obfuscation (0.7), and security risk (0.8) scores are justified given the signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution. The other reports correctly reflect benign code with low scores. The overall security concern is moderate, primarily driven by Report 1, warranting further investigation if code snippets confirm malicious indicators."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI wrapper with no embedded malicious or suspicious logic. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the behavior of 'run_command', which is not provided. The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and a low risk score. No issues are evident in the code snippet itself."

      "conclusion": "The code shows potential security concerns primarily due to dynamic execution and obfuscation, but lacks definitive malicious payloads. The risk level is moderate, warranting cautious use and further review if more code details are available."

      "conclusion": "The script is a simple command executor with significant security risks when handling untrusted input, especially with shell mode enabled. It does not contain malware or obfuscation but is vulnerable to command injection. The risk score should be high (~0.8), reflecting the potential for exploitation, while malware and obfuscation scores remain at 0."
