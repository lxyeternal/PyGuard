  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that Report 1's high malware (0.75), obfuscation (0.7), and security risk (0.8) scores are justified given the signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution. The other reports correctly reflect benign code with low scores. The overall security concern is moderate, primarily driven by Report 1, warranting further investigation if code snippets confirm malicious indicators."
