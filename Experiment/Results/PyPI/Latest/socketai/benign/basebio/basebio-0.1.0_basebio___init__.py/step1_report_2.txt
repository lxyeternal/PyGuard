{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility functions within a larger application. No explicit malicious intent is evident from the functions or comments provided.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from environment variables, function parameters, or imported modules. Specific input sources are not explicitly shown, but environment variables and function arguments are typical data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system calls if present, but none are explicitly shown in the provided snippet. The code does not appear to perform unsafe operations like executing untrusted code or writing to sensitive files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables, function parameters) through processing functions. There are no evident data flows leading to unsafe sinks or external data exfiltration points in the visible code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function names, or obfuscated code are present. No unusual dynamic code execution or backdoors are detected. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured into typical utility functions, with clear separation and no signs of obfuscation. It uses standard library functions, with no suspicious imports or calls. The absence of network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection points reduces concern. The overall structure suggests benign behavior, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code appears to be legitimate, with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It is well-structured, with no suspicious anomalies detected. The overall security risk is low.",
