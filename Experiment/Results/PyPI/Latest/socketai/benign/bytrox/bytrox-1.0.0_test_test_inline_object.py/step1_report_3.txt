  "purpose": "Unit test stub for the InlineObject model generated by OpenAPI tools.",
  "sources": "Code imports and class methods, mainly reading class definitions, method parameters, and local variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data processing, network, or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly instantiating objects with hardcoded values.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded string values like '0' for parameters; no input validation or dynamic data handling. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward unit test stub for a data model class, generated automatically, with methods to create instances with or without optional parameters. No network activity, no data leaks, and no suspicious code structures are present. It primarily imports modules, defines test cases, and creates object instances with fixed values.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated unit test script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It contains hardcoded values but no harmful actions or security vulnerabilities.",
