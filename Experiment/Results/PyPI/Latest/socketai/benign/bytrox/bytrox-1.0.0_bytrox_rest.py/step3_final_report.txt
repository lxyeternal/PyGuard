  "purpose": "A Python HTTP client wrapper around urllib3, handling SSL, proxies, connection pooling, and request/response management.",
  "sources": "Configuration inputs for SSL, proxy, request parameters, and response data stored in r.data.",
  "sinks": "Network requests via urllib3, response data stored in memory, response body logged at debug level.",
  "flows": "Configuration and request parameters flow into network request setup; response data flows back into response object and logs.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected. Logging response bodies could leak sensitive info if logs are insecure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard HTTP client implementation with proper SSL and proxy configuration, request handling, and error management. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. Logging response data at debug level is typical during development but should be controlled in production. The code does not perform any covert or malicious actions, nor does it contain backdoors or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured HTTP client wrapper with no malicious intent. The minor security concern is the debug logging of response bodies, which should be managed appropriately. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation.",
