{
  "purpose": "This code is a generated unit test scaffold for the InlineResponse200 model, designed to instantiate the model with static data for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string values assigned directly within the make_instance method for fields such as wallet_uuid, wallet_address, currency, network, and wallet_id.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code does not handle external input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The data flows from static assignments in make_instance to the instantiation of the InlineResponse200 object; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, generated boilerplate with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. Minor inconsistency in the make_instance method regarding optional parameters, but this does not impact security.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, generated unit test with static data assignments. It does not perform any network activity, data processing, or external input handling. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The only minor anomaly is the omission of 'wallet_id' in the required parameters branch, which is a test coverage detail, not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
