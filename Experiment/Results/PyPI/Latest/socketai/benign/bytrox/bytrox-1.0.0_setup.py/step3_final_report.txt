  "purpose": "Standard package setup script generated by OpenAPI Generator for Python packaging.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining package metadata, import statements, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "Static configuration data; no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and generated, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static 'setup.py' generated by OpenAPI Generator. It imports standard modules, defines static metadata and dependencies, and calls setup() with these values. There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, network activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. The code's purpose is solely to configure package installation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are consistent with its static, generated nature.",
