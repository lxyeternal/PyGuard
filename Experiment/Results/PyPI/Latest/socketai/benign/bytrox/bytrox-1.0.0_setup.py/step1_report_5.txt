{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'bytrox', used to configure package installation and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Constants defining package metadata, import statements, and the setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data sources are absent; the setup() function writes package metadata, but no external data handling or untrusted input processing is present.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code primarily sets static configuration; no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code appears standard for a Python package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setuptools modules, defines package metadata, specifies dependencies, and calls setup() with these parameters. It contains no dynamic code execution, network operations, or untrusted input handling. All components are typical for a setup.py file, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no indications of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It adheres to standard practices and does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements.",
