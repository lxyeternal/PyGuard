  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard, static `setup.py` script generated by OpenAPI Generator.\n- No dynamic code execution, input handling, network operations, or obfuscated code are mentioned.\n- All dependencies are statically defined, and no suspicious patterns or behaviors are identified.\n- The code is consistent with typical package setup scripts, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n- **Code content:** The code matches the descriptions; it is a typical `setup.py` with static strings, import statements, and a `setup()` call.\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in the code.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify the absence of malware and obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** The overall security risk is correctly assessed as zero, given the static and benign nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; no obfuscation or code hiding.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is justified; the script is standard and safe.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary based on the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final System-Wide Assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- The code is a straightforward, generated `setup.py` for packaging.\n- No dynamic or malicious code, no external inputs, no obfuscation.\n- The dependencies are standard, and the code's purpose is clear and benign.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is safe, standard, and free from malware or obfuscation. The scoring aligns with the analysis. No further action or concern is warranted.",
