  "purpose": "SDK boilerplate setup generated by OpenAPI Generator, including imports for API modules, configuration, exceptions, and models.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, including a placeholder import 'from bytrox.api._____api import Api'. No external data sources or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to data leaks or malicious actions; static code with no dynamic execution.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only contains import statements and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a placeholder import 'from bytrox.api._____api import Api', indicating incomplete or templated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, generated SDK boilerplate with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The placeholder import suggests incomplete code that could cause runtime errors if not replaced but does not introduce security vulnerabilities. No data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate, with the minor risk stemming from the placeholder. Overall, the code is benign and safe for use once the placeholder is addressed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign SDK boilerplate with a minor placeholder issue. No malware or security risks are present. The only concern is the placeholder import, which should be replaced to ensure proper functionality. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis.",
