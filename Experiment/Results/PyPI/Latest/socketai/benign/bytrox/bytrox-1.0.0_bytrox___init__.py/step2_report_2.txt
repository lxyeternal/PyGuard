  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  The only notable anomaly is the placeholder import `from bytrox.api._____api import Api`, which suggests incomplete code or a placeholder. This could potentially lead to runtime errors if not replaced before deployment.  \n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes?**  \n  The placeholder underscores an incomplete or templated code, not malicious. No security flaws are evident.  \n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n  - Risk: 0.1 — minimal, justified due to incomplete placeholder.  \n  - Confidence: 0.8 — reasonable given the placeholder concern.  \n  The score seems reasonable; no change needed.  \n- **Summary:**  \n  The placeholder is the main concern, but no malicious intent or security risk is evident.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  None.  \n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Risk: 0 — justified.  \n  - Confidence: 1 — justified.  \n- **Summary:**  \n  The code is standard SDK boilerplate, safe, and well-understood.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No anomalies or suspicious activity.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  None.  \n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Risk: 0 — justified.  \n  - Confidence: 1 — justified.  \n- **Summary:**  \n  Standard SDK setup, no security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No, the code is purely import statements and metadata.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  None.  \n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Risk: 0 — justified.  \n  - Confidence: 0.9 — reasonable.  \n- **Summary:**  \n  Safe, generated SDK code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  None.  \n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Risk: 0.1 — minimal, justified by the autogenerated nature.  \n  - Confidence: 0.9 — justified.  \n- **Summary:**  \n  Typical SDK code, no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports are 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports are 0, consistent with the code being straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, justified by the placeholder in report 1. The placeholder could cause runtime issues but not security risks.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — primarily due to the placeholder import in report 1, which suggests incomplete code rather than malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign SDK boilerplate with a minor concern about the placeholder import. No security risks or malware are present.",
