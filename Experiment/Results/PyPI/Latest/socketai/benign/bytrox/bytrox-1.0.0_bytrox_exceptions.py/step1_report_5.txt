{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling OpenAPI-related errors in Python, including type, value, key errors, and general API exceptions, along with a helper function for rendering data paths.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions, exception handling, and the render_path function which processes input paths (lists of keys or indices). No external input reading or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data are present. The code primarily raises and formats exception messages based on internal data.",
  "flows": "The flow involves creating exception objects with messages and optional path information; the render_path function converts a list of keys/indices into a string, used in exception messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code follows standard exception handling patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exceptions inheriting from built-in exceptions for API error handling, with optional detailed context about error locations. The render_path function formats a list of path elements into a string for clear error messaging. There are no indications of malicious code, data leakage, or security issues. The code is straightforward and primarily utility-based.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of exception classes and a helper function for formatting paths, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves to facilitate error reporting in an OpenAPI client or server environment.",
