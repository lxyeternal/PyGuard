  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for OpenAPI-related error handling, including rendering error paths.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static code with class definitions and a utility function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or external calls present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only internal exception message construction and path rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of custom exception class definitions and a utility function to render data paths for error messages. It does not perform any input/output operations, network activity, or data processing that could pose security risks. All operations are static, and there are no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focusing solely on exception handling and message formatting for an OpenAPI client library. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is present.",
