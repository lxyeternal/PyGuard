{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling OpenAPI-related errors and provide utility functions for error message formatting.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading functions; code defines classes and functions only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing, output, or external communication implemented.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely class and function definitions with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of exception class definitions and a utility function.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions, intended for API error handling, including type, value, key, and general API errors. The 'render_path' utility constructs string representations of data paths for error messages. There are no dynamic data inputs, network operations, or security-sensitive data processing. The code does not perform any data processing, external communication, or contain hardcoded secrets. It is a straightforward implementation of error handling structures, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and designed for exception handling within an API context. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious data flows, and no security vulnerabilities. It is safe for use and does not pose any security risks.",
