  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code only defines exception classes and a utility function.\n- No data input/output, network communication, or external data handling is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.\n- The code appears to be a standard part of an OpenAPI-generated client or server library, intended solely for error handling.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The exception classes (ApiTypeError, ApiValueError, ApiKeyError, ApiException) are straightforward, extending standard Python exceptions.\n- The `render_path` function formats a list of path elements into a string, used in error messages.\n- No dynamic data processing, no external calls, no data leaks, no malware, no obfuscation.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, as there's no security-sensitive operation or data handling.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- No reason to adjust scores upward; the code is benign.\n- The detailed reasoning in each report aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a benign, standard exception handling module for an OpenAPI client or server.\n- No vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation present.\n- The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code poses no security risks. The scores are justified and should remain as they are.",
