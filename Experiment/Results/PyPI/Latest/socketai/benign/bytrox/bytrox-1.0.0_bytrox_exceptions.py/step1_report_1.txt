{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling API-related errors and provides a utility function for rendering error paths.",
  "sources": "None (no data input or external data reading functions present). The code only defines classes and a helper function.",
  "sinks": "None (no data output or external communication). No untrusted data processing or transmission occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as there are no data handling or transmission mechanisms.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. Exception handling classes are standard and straightforward; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes for API error handling, including ApiTypeError, ApiValueError, ApiKeyError, and ApiException, along with a helper function 'render_path' for formatting error paths. All components appear standard and intended for error reporting within an API context. No input/output operations, external network communication, or data manipulation are present. The code structure and implementation are typical for error handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard error handling module with no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. It simply defines exception classes and a utility function without performing any external data operations or security-sensitive actions.",
