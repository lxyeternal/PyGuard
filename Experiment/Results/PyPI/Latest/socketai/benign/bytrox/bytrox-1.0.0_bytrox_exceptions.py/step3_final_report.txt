{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes and a utility function for error handling in an OpenAPI-generated Python client or server.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data, nor does it perform external data handling.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data sinks or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes and a helper function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is static, straightforward, and standard for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling and a utility function 'render_path'. It contains no data input/output, network operations, or dynamic behavior. The exception classes extend standard Python exceptions and are used for structured error reporting. The 'render_path' function formats a list of path elements into a string for error messages. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code is benign, static, and typical for an API client or server error handling module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of error handling classes and a utility function with no security concerns or malicious intent. All signals indicate no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
