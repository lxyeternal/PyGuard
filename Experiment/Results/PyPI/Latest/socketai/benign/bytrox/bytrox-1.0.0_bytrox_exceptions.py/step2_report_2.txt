  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any potential security concerns.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is purely class definitions for exception handling and a utility function (`render_path`).\n- No data input/output, network communication, or external data processing.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The purpose is to facilitate error reporting within an API client or server context.\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and potential issues:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code?**  \n- The code contains only standard exception classes and a helper function.  \n- No vulnerabilities, malicious code, or security flaws are present.  \n- The logic is straightforward, with no data flows or external interactions.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n- The reports correctly identify the code as standard, benign, and without malicious intent.  \n- No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue?**  \n- All reports give malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0.  \n- These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n- No issues warrant a higher risk score.  \n- The code is purely structural, with no security implications.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**  \n- No malicious behavior is present; scores of 0 are justified.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions?**  \n- All reports are cautious and accurate, avoiding unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report?**  \n- The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Additional critical considerations:\n\n- The code does not perform any dynamic operations, data handling, or external communication.  \n- The utility function `render_path` is safe and straightforward.  \n- Exception classes are standard and do not introduce security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the analysis, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a standard, benign error handling utility module.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Score | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0            | No malicious activity detected                             |\n| Obfuscated        | 0            | Code is clear, straightforward, and standard              |\n| Security Risk     | 0            | No vulnerabilities or security issues present            |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, well-structured, and poses no security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
