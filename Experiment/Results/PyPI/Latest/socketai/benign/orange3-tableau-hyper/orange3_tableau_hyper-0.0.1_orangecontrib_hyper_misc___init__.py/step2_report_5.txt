  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code snippet: `from .hyper import HyperReader`.\n- The reports consistently identify this as a straightforward import statement from a local module.\n- No dynamic behavior, data flows, or external interactions are present.\n- All scores for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are zero or very low, aligning with the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues in the code:\n- The code is just an import statement; no issues are present.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident.\n- The code snippet alone does not pose any security risks.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; they correctly interpret the minimal nature of the code.\n- No logical flaws or errors are apparent in the reasoning.\n- They appropriately conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (0 or 0.1), which is reasonable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.1, which is justified.\n- The minimal code snippet cannot be considered risky or malicious.\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- Since no malicious activity is indicated, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The reports are consistent here.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- All reports avoid assumptions; they recognize the code as benign based solely on its content.\n- No unwarranted claims are made.\n\n### Score consistency:\n- The scores align well with the analysis.\n- The high confidence levels (0.8–1.0) are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, given the lack of any suspicious elements)\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, standard import statement with no security concerns)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code snippet is benign, and no security issues are evident. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
