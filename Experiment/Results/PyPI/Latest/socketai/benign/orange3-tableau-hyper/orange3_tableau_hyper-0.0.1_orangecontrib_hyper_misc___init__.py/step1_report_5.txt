  "purpose": "The code imports the 'HyperReader' class or object from the 'hyper' module, likely for reading or processing hypermedia or similar data formats.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module named 'hyper'. No external data input, user input, or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis can be conducted due to the absence of executable code or data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not contain any suspicious or unusual constructs. The import appears standard.",
  "analysis": "This snippet only contains a single import statement, which is a common and benign operation in Python. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code. As this is only a fragment, a full assessment would require additional context, but based solely on this, there are no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code fragment is a straightforward import statement with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe, but further context would be necessary for a comprehensive review.",
