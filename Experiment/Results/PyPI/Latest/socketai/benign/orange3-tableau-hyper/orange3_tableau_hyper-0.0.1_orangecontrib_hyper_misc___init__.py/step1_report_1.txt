  "sinks": "No sinks present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow observable in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only a single import statement with no suspicious or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "This code imports a class named HyperReader from a local module within the same package. There are no external data sources, user inputs, or dynamic code execution. The import is straightforward and standard. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious operations. The minimal code reduces the likelihood of obfuscated or malicious intent, and no credentials or external communication is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It appears to be a normal part of a larger codebase. No security risks are evident from this snippet alone.",
