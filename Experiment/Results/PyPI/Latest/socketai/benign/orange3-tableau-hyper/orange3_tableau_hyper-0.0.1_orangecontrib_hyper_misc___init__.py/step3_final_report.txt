  "purpose": "The code imports the HyperReader class from a local module 'hyper', serving as a dependency inclusion in a larger project.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs a static import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected in the code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious behavior, data flows, or external interactions. The reports correctly identify the minimal and benign nature of this code. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the context. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external communication suggest a very low security risk. The high confidence scores reflect certainty about its benign nature. Overall, the code is safe, and the reports are accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The current scores are justified and accurate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
