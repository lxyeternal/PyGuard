  "purpose": "The script is intended to set up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the execution context (if __name__ == '__main__') and imports the setuptools.setup function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "The flow is simply execution of the setup() function when run as a script, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code is minimal and standard for package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setup function from setuptools and calls it when executed as the main module. There are no additional operations, data handling, or external inputs involved. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. It appears to be a boilerplate setup script for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup script used for packaging Python projects. No malicious activity, security issues, or obfuscation are present.",
