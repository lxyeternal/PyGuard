  "purpose": "Minimal Python setup script for package installation using setuptools",
  "sources": "Import of 'setup' from 'setuptools' and invocation within main guard",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Direct call to setup() when executed as main module",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard setup script with no external inputs, no dynamic code, and no malicious behavior. It simply imports 'setup' and calls it if run directly. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, and the structure is typical for Python packaging. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activity are present. The benign nature is confirmed by the absence of suspicious patterns and the simplicity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, boilerplate Python setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals and reports correctly identify it as safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
