  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard, and typical for a setup script; no unusual code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward Python setup script, used for packaging. It imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it in the main block. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. It does not process user input, network data, or execute dynamic code. The simplicity and conventional structure indicate no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical packaging setup without any suspicious or malicious modifications.",
