{
  "purpose": "The code provides a custom file format handler for Tableau Hyper files, enabling reading and writing Hyper files within the application.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from Hyper files via pantab.frames_from_hyper and table_to_frame functions, and reads the filename attribute for input operations.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to Hyper files via pantab.frame_to_hyper. Exceptions are raised with error messages; no external data sink detected.",
  "flows": "Input filename is used in read/write methods; data is converted between pandas DataFrame and internal table format; exceptions could leak info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. Dependency check for 'pantab' is basic. No unusual code behaviors or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for handling Tableau Hyper files, with methods for reading and writing data. The 'read' method calls pantab.frames_from_hyper to load data into a pandas DataFrame, then converts to internal format. The 'write_file' method converts data to pandas DataFrame and writes it to Hyper format. Error handling raises IOErrors with messages containing filenames but no sensitive info. The dependency 'pantab' is used for Hyper file operations, which is a legitimate library. No suspicious code, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detected. The code performs file I/O operations and data conversions securely, with exception handling, but no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and safe, serving as a file handler for Tableau Hyper files. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. The overall security risk is low.",
