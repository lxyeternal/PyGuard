  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation for reading and writing Tableau Hyper files. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The minor anomaly of a redundant check does not affect security. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality. Overall, the security risk is very low, and the code can be considered safe."
