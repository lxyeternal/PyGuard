  "purpose": "Importing the HyperReader class from the misc module, likely for use within the current package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the misc module from the same package/directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are evident in this line; it's a straightforward import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible from this single line alone; no input/output or data handling occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only an import statement; no anomalies or suspicious activity are observable at this stage. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious indicators present.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a relative import of the HyperReader class from the misc module within the same package. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. As this is just an import statement, it is unlikely to be malicious by itself. No complex flows or anomalies are detectable from this fragment alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard module importing without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
