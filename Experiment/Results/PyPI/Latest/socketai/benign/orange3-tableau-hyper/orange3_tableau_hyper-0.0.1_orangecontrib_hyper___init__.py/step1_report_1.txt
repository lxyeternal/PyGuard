  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement from a local module. No data inputs, outputs, or further logic is present. As it is only an import, it does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks by itself. Without additional context or code, there are no indicators of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard part of a larger codebase, and on its own, it does not raise security concerns.",
