  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow identified in this isolated import statement",
  "anomalies": "Single import statement; no anomalies or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import from a local module. There are no dynamic imports, no code execution, and no handling of untrusted data within this snippet. Since it is only an import statement, it does not contain any malicious behavior by itself. The safety depends on the content of 'misc.py', which is not provided. Based solely on this line, no malicious intent or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any operations or data handling that could be suspicious.",
