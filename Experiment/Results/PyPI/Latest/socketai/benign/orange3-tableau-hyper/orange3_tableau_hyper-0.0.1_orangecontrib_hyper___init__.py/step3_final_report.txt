{
  "purpose": "Import the HyperReader class from the local misc module.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the import loads a class into the namespace but does not execute or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard import statement with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import of HyperReader from the misc module. It involves no data handling, network activity, or execution beyond importing a class. The code is syntactically correct and typical in modular Python projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The minimal nature of the code indicates a very low security risk. The import alone cannot be malicious unless the imported module contains malicious code, which is outside the scope of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, standard, and poses no security risk. The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward import with no vulnerabilities.",
