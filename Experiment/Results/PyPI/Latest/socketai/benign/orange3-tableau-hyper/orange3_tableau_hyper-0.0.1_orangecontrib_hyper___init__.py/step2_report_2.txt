  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their accuracy, consistency, and implications.\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Assessment**: The report correctly identifies that the code is a simple import statement with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks.\n   - **Scores**: Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0 — all appropriate.\n   - **Confidence**: 0.8 is reasonable given the minimal code.\n   - **Conclusion**: Accurate and consistent.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Assessment**: Similar to Report 1, it correctly notes the straightforward nature of the import, with no evidence of malicious activity.\n   - **Scores**: Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1 — the latter suggests a slight concern, but given the code's simplicity, this is probably an overestimate. A minimal import line shouldn't warrant any security risk score above 0.\n   - **Confidence**: 0.9, which is high, but perhaps slightly overconfident given the minimal code.\n   - **Recommendation**: Reduce `securityRisk` to 0 for consistency with the other reports, unless there's additional context not provided.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Assessment**: Correctly states that the import is standard and not suspicious.\n   - **Scores**: Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1 — again, this is likely an overestimation for such a simple import.\n   - **Confidence**: 0.9, appropriate for the minimal code.\n   - **Recommendation**: Lower `securityRisk` to 0 for consistency.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Assessment**: Same as above; the import is standard, with no malicious implications.\n   - **Scores**: Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0 — consistent and appropriate.\n   - **Confidence**: 1, which is justified given the simplicity.\n   - **Conclusion**: Correct.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Assessment**: Also accurate; no suspicious activity or anomalies.\n   - **Scores**: Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n   - **Confidence**: 0.9, suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign import statement.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate.\n- The securityRisk scores are slightly inconsistent; some reports assign a small value (0.1) despite the simplicity of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware scores**: Keep at 0 across all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores**: Correctly 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **SecurityRisk scores**: Should be uniformly 0, since a single import statement from a local module does not pose a security risk by itself.\n\n### Overall Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **SecurityRisk**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are accurate in their analysis. The scores for malware and obfuscation are correct. The minor security risk scores should be lowered to zero for consistency, as the code snippet alone does not introduce any security concerns.",
