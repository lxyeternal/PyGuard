{
  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a package and import the HyperReader class from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module name (__name__) and the 'hyper' module from the same package.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The namespace declaration is triggered by the import statement, and the class HyperReader is imported from a local module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The namespace declaration is standard for namespace packages.",
  "analysis": "The code uses '__import__' to invoke 'pkg_resources' and declare a namespace package with 'declare_namespace(__name__)'. It then imports a local module 'hyper' and the class 'HyperReader'. The code is minimal and appears standard for setting up a namespace package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace declaration combined with a local import. It contains no malicious intent or security risks.",
