  "purpose": "Namespace declaration using pkg_resources and import of HyperReader from local module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it performs a namespace declaration and a local import.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or sinks; no data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up namespace and imports.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of __import__ with a string argument is noted but not malicious; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard namespace declaration with pkg_resources and imports a local class. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The use of __import__ is unconventional but benign. No data flows or external interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for namespace setup, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate.",
