  "purpose": "Namespace declaration and importing the HyperReader module",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' for namespace declaration and imports 'HyperReader' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output is present; the code only performs namespace declaration and import.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__('pkg_resources') for namespace declaration is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a namespace using pkg_resources, which is a standard technique for package namespace management. It then imports a class 'HyperReader' from a relative module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious logic. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies beyond the unconventional namespace declaration method.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet performs namespace declaration and imports a class. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
