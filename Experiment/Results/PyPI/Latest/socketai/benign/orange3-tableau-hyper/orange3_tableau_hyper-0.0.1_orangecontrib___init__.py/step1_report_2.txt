  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with string argument is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a namespace using pkg_resources, which is a standard practice in namespace packages. It then imports HyperReader from a local module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or data leaks. The code is minimal and typical for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard namespace declaration with a straightforward import. There are no signs of malware or malicious activity.",
