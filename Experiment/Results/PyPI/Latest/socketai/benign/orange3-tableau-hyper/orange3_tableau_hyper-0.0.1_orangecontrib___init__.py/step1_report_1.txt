  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package and import the HyperReader class from a local module.",
  "sources": "The __import__('pkg_resources').declare_namespace(__name__) statement which imports and executes pkg_resources, and the import of .hyper.HyperReader.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs namespace declaration and imports.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of declare_namespace suggests compatibility with namespace packages, which is standard. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' to declare a namespace, which is a common pattern for namespace packages. It then imports HyperReader from a local module. No data input, output, or dynamic execution is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard namespace declaration and module import without any suspicious or malicious activity. No security concerns are evident from this snippet.",
