  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package and import HyperReader from a local module.",
  "sources": "Namespace declaration via __import__('pkg_resources').declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sinks": "Import of HyperReader from a relative module",
  "flows": "Namespace declaration is passive; no data flows from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with 'pkg_resources' for namespace declaration is a known pattern; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs namespace declaration using the standard pkg_resources method, which is common for namespace packages. It then imports a class HyperReader from a relative module. There are no signs of data input, untrusted data handling, or malicious code. The code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical namespace declaration combined with a simple import statement. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected based on this fragment.",
