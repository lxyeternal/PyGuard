{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() function such as package name, version, author info, description, URL, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present as the code does not handle untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual choices such as the author email 'hitler@gmail.com' and URL 'https://thugging.org', which are suspicious or inappropriate. The description mentions 'obfuscation test lib', which may imply testing obfuscation techniques, but no actual obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata. It contains no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity. The author email and URL are suspicious and potentially malicious, but these are metadata and not active code behavior. There are no malicious functions, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities evident in this static configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with questionable metadata. There is no malicious code, no data flows involving untrusted input, and no malware behavior. The primary concern is the suspicious contact information rather than code behavior.",
