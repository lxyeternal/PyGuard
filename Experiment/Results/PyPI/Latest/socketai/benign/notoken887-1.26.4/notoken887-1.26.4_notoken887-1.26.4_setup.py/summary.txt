  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign with respect to security; the primary concern is the suspicious contact information, which is a reputational or social engineering issue rather than a technical security threat. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The overall security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to metadata. No modifications to the scores are necessary."
