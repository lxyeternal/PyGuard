  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, likely intended for general functionality. No explicit purpose is evident from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, standard input, and possibly hardcoded values within the script.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file system writes, or execution of system commands, though none are explicitly shown in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input to processing functions, but no explicit malicious flow is identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated segments, or hardcoded credentials are apparent in the provided code snippet. The code is straightforward with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "A line-by-line review shows standard Python syntax with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs. The code uses common library functions and does not perform unsafe operations. There are no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. Without additional context or external dependencies, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. The code seems safe, though limited information prevents full certainty.",
