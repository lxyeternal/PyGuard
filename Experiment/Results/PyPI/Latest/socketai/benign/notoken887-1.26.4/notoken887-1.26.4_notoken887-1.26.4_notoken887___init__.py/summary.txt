  "conclusion": "The overall codebase appears mostly benign with a small subset (Report 4) showing signs of malicious activity. The scores are consistent with the reports' findings. Confirming the presence of eval/exec and network activity in Report 4 is essential before finalizing high malicious scores. The recommended final scores are malware=0.7, obfuscated=0.8, securityRisk=0.75, with high confidence in the suspicion of malicious behavior in Report 4 if such indicators are present."
