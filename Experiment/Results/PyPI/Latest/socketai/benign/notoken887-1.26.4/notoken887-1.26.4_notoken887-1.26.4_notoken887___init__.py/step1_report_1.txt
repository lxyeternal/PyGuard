{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, user input, and possibly external files or network sources (if any).",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to files, console, or network connections; uses subprocess or system calls if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (environment, input) through processing functions to sinks (outputs or external systems).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with typical data handling routines. No indicators of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system manipulation. Usage of third-party libraries is standard and justified. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated parts, or hidden functionalities were found. The code structure and format are clean and typical for Python scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates within expected parameters for a data processing utility, with no anomalies or malicious behaviors detected.",
