  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, file I/O, network connections, input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Logs, files, network endpoints, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data flows from sources through processing to sinks, potentially leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is either absent or described as standard, benign Python scripts with no malicious indicators. No obfuscation or malicious activity is evident. Security risk scores of 0.2 are justified due to untrusted data flows, but no actual threats are identified. Confidence levels are high where code is analyzed, and scores are consistent with the assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears safe with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk reflects cautious acknowledgment of untrusted data flows but no malicious intent. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the provided descriptions.",
