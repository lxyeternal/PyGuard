  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- No code provided; all fields are \"No code available.\"\n- Scores: confidence=0, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- *Assessment:* Since there's no code, it's correct that no issues can be identified. The scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same as Report 1: no code provided.\n- Scores: confidence=0, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- *Assessment:* Correct; no code means no analysis possible.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Provides a detailed analysis of a Python script.\n- Finds no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and low security risk.\n- Scores: confidence=0.8, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- *Assessment:* The reasoning aligns with the analysis; no malware detected, and the low security risk seems reasonable given the benign description. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Also describes a code snippet with no suspicious activity.\n- Finds no obfuscation or malware, with a high confidence (0.9).\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- *Assessment:* Consistent with the analysis; the low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- No code provided; similar to Reports 1 and 2.\n- Scores: confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- *Assessment:* Correct, given the absence of code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify the absence of code where applicable.\n- The detailed reports (3 and 4) do not identify malicious activity or obfuscation, and their scores reflect that.\n- The low security risk scores (0.2) are consistent with benign assessments.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- No changes needed for the scores or conclusions.\n- The malware scores are appropriately zero across all reports, reflecting no malicious activity.\n- The confidence scores in the detailed reports are high, matching the thoroughness of their analysis.\n\n### Final estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 in detailed reports seems reasonable, indicating low but not zero risk due to potential untrusted inputs or data flows.\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and their assessments are justified based on the provided information. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
