  "purpose": "Instantiate a FastMCP object with the identifier 'JiraMCPServer'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'mcp.server.fastmcp'.",
  "sinks": "None present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import statement → instantiation of FastMCP object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code behavior. The class name 'FastMCP' and argument 'JiraMCPServer' are context-specific but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a package that appears to be part of a custom or third-party module. It then creates an instance of 'FastMCP' with a string parameter. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. The package and class names suggest legitimate use within a system that manages MCP (Message Communication Protocol) or similar services. No external inputs or data sources are involved. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no obvious security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign initialization of a class instance related to MCP services. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
