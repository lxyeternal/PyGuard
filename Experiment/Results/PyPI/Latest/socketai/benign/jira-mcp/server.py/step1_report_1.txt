  "purpose": "Initialize an instance of the FastMCP class from the mcp.server.fastmcp module with the argument 'JiraMCPServer'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing FastMCP from mcp.server.fastmcp; instantiation of FastMCP with a string argument.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of the mcp object created, depending on subsequent code (not provided here).",
  "flows": "Importing class, then creating an instance with a string parameter; no further data flow shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; usage appears standard. The string 'JiraMCPServer' might be a server identifier or configuration name but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a presumably internal or third-party package and instantiates it with a specific string. No input/output, network operations, or data handling are visible in this snippet. The code appears to be straightforward initialization without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple initialization of a class with a string argument, likely a server identifier. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks in this limited snippet.",
