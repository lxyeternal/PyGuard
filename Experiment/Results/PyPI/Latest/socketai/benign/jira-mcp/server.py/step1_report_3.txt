  "sources": "Import statement importing FastMCP class from mcp.server.fastmcp",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of FastMCP with a server name string",
  "flows": "Import of class -> creation of FastMCP instance with server name",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code structures observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external module and creates an instance with a specific server name. No data is read from untrusted sources, nor are there any obvious sinks like network transmissions or file operations. The server name 'JiraMCPServer' appears to be a string identifier, likely used internally. Without additional context or code, no malicious behavior or suspicious activity is evident. The code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet simply imports a class and creates an instance with a specified server name. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or malicious behavior based on this limited code fragment.",
