{
  "purpose": "Instantiate an object of the FastMCP class from the mcp.server.fastmcp module, likely for communication with a server named 'JiraMCPServer'.",
  "sources": "Import statement for mcp.server.fastmcp and the string argument 'JiraMCPServer' used in the FastMCP constructor.",
  "sinks": "Constructor of FastMCP, potential network or server communication within the class (not visible here).",
  "flows": "Import and object creation using the server name 'JiraMCPServer' passed to FastMCP, which may involve network activity or server interaction internally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns detected; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external module and creates an instance with a specific server name. No suspicious or malicious code is visible in this snippet. Since the actual behavior depends on the implementation of FastMCP, which is not provided, no malicious activity can be confirmed. The code appears to be a standard object initialization with a server name.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply initializes a class instance with a server name, with no evident malicious intent or security risks in the provided snippet. Without further context, it appears benign.",
