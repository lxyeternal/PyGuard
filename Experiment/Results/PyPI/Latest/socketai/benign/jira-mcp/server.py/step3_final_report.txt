  "purpose": "Initialize the FastMCP class with a server identifier 'JiraMCPServer'.",
  "sources": "The string argument 'JiraMCPServer' used during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if FastMCP internally performs network communication or handles sensitive data, these could be sinks, but not evident from this code.",
  "flows": "The instantiation flows from the import to the creation of the FastMCP object with the server string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import and instantiation of a class with a string argument. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are visible. The string 'JiraMCPServer' appears to be a server identifier, not a secret. Given the minimal code, the malware score is set to 0, obfuscation score to 0, and security risk is low (~0.1-0.2). The confidence level is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code. Internal behavior of FastMCP cannot be assessed without its implementation, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No further action is necessary unless internal implementation of FastMCP reveals malicious behavior.",
