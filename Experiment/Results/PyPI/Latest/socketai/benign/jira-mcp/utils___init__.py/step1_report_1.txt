  "sources": "Potential sources include input functions, environment variable reads, file reads, network calls, or imported modules; however, the provided code contains no such operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include system commands, network connections, file writes, or database queries; none are explicitly present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flows from sources to sinks are observable, as the code lacks input, processing, or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is empty and contains no logic, variables, or structural elements; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "A comprehensive review of the code reveals no executable logic, data handling, or suspicious patterns. The absence of code elements means no malicious or insecure behavior can be identified or inferred.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided empty code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears benign or non-existent in its current form.",
