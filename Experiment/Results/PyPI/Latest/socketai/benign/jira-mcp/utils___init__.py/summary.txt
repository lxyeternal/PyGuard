  "conclusion": "The overall assessments are consistent with the provided descriptions. The only notable adjustment is setting Report 1's security risk to zero due to lack of code. Report 5's higher obfuscation and suspicious patterns justify its elevated scores. The scores across reports are justified and reflect a cautious but accurate evaluation of potential malicious behavior and security risks."
