{
  "purpose": "This code appears to load environment variables and then run a method from a server module, likely for starting or managing a server or service.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'server', 'dotenv', and 'tools.get_resolution_issue'. Specifically, 'load_dotenv()' reads environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'mcp.run()' could potentially be a sink if 'mcp' is compromised or contains malicious code, but there is no direct untrusted data sink observed here.",
  "flows": "The code loads environment variables, then executes 'mcp.run()' which may utilize loaded environment variables or other modules. No explicit data flows are visible within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code constructs are present. The import of 'tools.get_resolution_issue' is unused, which is odd but not malicious. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script loads environment variables via 'load_dotenv()', then runs 'mcp.run()'. The presence of an unused import ('tools.get_resolution_issue') may indicate incomplete code or overlooked cleanup, but does not suggest malicious intent. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. There are no untrusted inputs or external data sources beyond environment variables, which are standard practice. The code is minimal and does not perform any malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple server startup script that loads environment variables and starts a service via 'mcp.run()'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The unused import is an anomaly but not harmful. Overall, this is benign and poses no security risks based on this snippet.",
