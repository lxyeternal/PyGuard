  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring and reasoning.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is straightforward: load environment variables, import modules, and run `mcp.run()`.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are visible.\n- Multiple reports note the unused import `tools.get_resolution_issue`, which is benign but may indicate incomplete code.\n- The main function `mcp.run()` is a potential sink, but without access to its implementation, we cannot determine if it performs malicious actions.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code snippet's benign appearance.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Checks:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or malicious behaviors are confirmed. The code is minimal and standard.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The only minor flaw is the unused import, which is not harmful but could be cleaned up.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: consistently 0, which is reasonable.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n  - Security risk: very low (0.1-0.2), which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None are apparent. The code relies on external modules (`server.mcp`) whose content is unknown; however, based solely on this snippet, there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code structure and potential external risks.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are generally reasonable.\n- The high confidence scores (0.8-0.9) are justified given the simplicity and benign appearance.\n- The low security risk scores (0.1-0.2) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1-0.2 (minimal risk, standard startup script)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard code)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The risk is minimal, primarily due to reliance on external modules whose content isn't available for review. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code snippet provided.",
