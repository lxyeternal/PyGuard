  "purpose": "Load environment variables and execute the main process via mcp.run() in a Python startup script.",
  "sources": "load_dotenv() reads environment variables; import mcp from server; import tools.get_resolution_issue (unused); call to mcp.run()",
  "sinks": "mcp.run() potentially acts as a sink depending on its implementation; no direct untrusted data handling in this snippet",
  "flows": "load_dotenv() sets environment variables -> mcp.run() executes with environment context; import of tools.get_resolution_issue is unused",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of tools.get_resolution_issue; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward: it loads environment variables, imports modules, and runs a main function. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or data leaks are evident. The only anomaly is the unused import, which suggests incomplete code but not malicious intent. External modules' behavior cannot be assessed, but the code itself is benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.1), consistent with a standard startup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate given the simplicity of the snippet. External modules could pose risks, but based solely on this code, the overall assessment is safe.",
