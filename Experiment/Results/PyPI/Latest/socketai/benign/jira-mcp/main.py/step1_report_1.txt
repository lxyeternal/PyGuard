{
  "purpose": "This code appears to load environment variables and execute a main function from a module named 'mcp' in the 'server' package, likely for server or network-related operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables via 'load_dotenv()'. It also imports 'mcp' from 'server' and 'tools.get_resolution_issue', which may involve data or input handling within those modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are within 'mcp.run()', which could perform network or system actions, and any environment variables accessed or used within the imported modules.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables loaded by 'load_dotenv()' into the imported modules and possibly from 'tools.get_resolution_issue' into other operations; the main flow is execution via 'mcp.run()'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated code are present. The code structure is straightforward, with no apparent malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables and runs a main function from an imported module, which could perform various operations depending on their implementation. The presence of 'tools.get_resolution_issue' suggests some issue detection or configuration checks, but no malicious code is evident. Without access to the imported modules, no malicious or malicious-sounding behaviors can be confirmed. The code itself is simple, standard, and does not exhibit signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is minimal, standard, and primarily sets up environment variables and executes a main function. No malicious patterns or suspicious activity are detected.",
