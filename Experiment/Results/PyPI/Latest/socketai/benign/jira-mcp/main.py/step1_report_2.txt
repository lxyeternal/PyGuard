{
  "purpose": "The script appears to initialize and run a method 'mcp.run()' after loading environment variables, potentially for server or application startup.",
  "sources": "Environment variables loaded via 'load_dotenv()'; import from 'server', 'tools.get_resolution_issue', which may read system or network data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially 'mcp.run()' if it performs network operations or data handling; import statements could lead to code execution if the modules are malicious.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and imported modules (server, tools.get_resolution_issue) are loaded, then 'mcp.run()' is executed. Data from environment variables could flow into 'mcp.run()' if it uses them.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'dotenv' for environment variable management is standard; no hardcoded credentials are visible; no obfuscated code or suspicious imports evident. The import of 'tools.get_resolution_issue' is unconventional if it is unused or if its purpose is unclear.",
  "analysis": "The code performs minimal operations: loading environment variables and executing 'mcp.run()'. The presence of potentially unknown modules ('server', 'tools.get_resolution_issue') and the execution of 'mcp.run()' could be points of concern if those modules contain malicious code. The code does not contain any obvious malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network activity within this snippet. However, it depends heavily on external modules whose content is unknown. No hardcoded secrets, malicious behaviors, or obfuscated code are apparent in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple startup script that loads environment variables and executes a main function. There are no clear signs of malicious intent or malware within this code fragment. The risk largely depends on the content of imported modules, which cannot be assessed here. Overall, the code appears benign but should be reviewed in conjunction with the external modules.",
