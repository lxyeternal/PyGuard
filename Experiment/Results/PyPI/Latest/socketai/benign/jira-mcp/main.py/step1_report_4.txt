{
  "purpose": "The code initializes environment variables and runs a function from the 'server' module.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables with 'load_dotenv()'; importing 'mcp' from 'server'; importing 'tools.get_resolution_issue'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables loaded and then 'mcp.run()' executed; no data flow from external sources to sinks is visible.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or obfuscated code detected. The import 'tools.get_resolution_issue' appears unused, but this is not suspicious alone.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables using 'load_dotenv()' and calls 'mcp.run()'. The import of 'tools.get_resolution_issue' is unused in this snippet, which may suggest incomplete code or future expansion but not malicious. No data is transmitted, no sensitive data handling is visible, and no suspicious behaviors are apparent. The structure is straightforward and typical of a script initializing environment and executing a main function.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, merely setting up environment variables and executing a main process.",
