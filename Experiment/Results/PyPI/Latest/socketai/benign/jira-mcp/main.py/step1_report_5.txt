{
  "purpose": "The script appears to initialize environment variables and execute a method called 'run' from the 'mcp' object imported from the 'server' module, likely to start a server or process.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via load_dotenv(), importing 'mcp' from 'server', and importing 'tools.get_resolution_issue' (though unused).",
  "sinks": "The 'mcp.run()' call may be a sink if it involves network operations or executing untrusted code, but details are not provided.",
  "flows": "Environment variables loaded -> execution of 'mcp.run()' which likely initiates further actions; no explicit data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "The import of 'tools.get_resolution_issue' without usage is unnecessary but not suspicious; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, loads environment variables, and executes a method. The imported modules do not exhibit malicious behavior inherently. The unused import 'tools.get_resolution_issue' might suggest incomplete or extraneous code but is not malicious. 'load_dotenv()' is standard for managing environment variables. 'mcp.run()' could be a normal operation, but without additional context, there's no evidence of malicious behavior. No suspicious code constructs or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard setup and execution steps typical for starting a server or process. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
