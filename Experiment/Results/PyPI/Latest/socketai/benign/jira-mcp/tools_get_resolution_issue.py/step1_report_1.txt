{
  "purpose": "Define an asynchronous function that processes user queries about issues and returns AI-generated resolutions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'server' and 'utils.llm_call' modules, and the function parameter 'query'.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'make_llm_request(query)', which sends data to an external AI service.",
  "flows": "Input 'query' flows into 'make_llm_request', which likely transmits data to an external API for processing and returns the response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code relies on external modules; potential risk depends on their implementation, but nothing suspicious is evident here.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules that are likely responsible for server interactions and AI requests. The 'get_issue_resolution' function is decorated with '@mcp.tool()' suggesting registration as a tool, and it asynchronously forwards a user query to 'make_llm_request'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors within this fragment. The external modules could pose risks depending on their implementation, but based solely on this code, no malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a straightforward wrapper to process user issues through an external language model. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. Potential risks depend on the external modules' implementations, but none are suspicious here.",
