{
  "purpose": "The code defines an asynchronous tool function that processes user queries describing issues and returns suggested resolutions by calling an external language model API.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'query' parameter of the get_issue_resolution function.",
  "sinks": "The function passes the 'query' data directly to make_llm_request, which likely sends data to an external API; the response is returned as a string.",
  "flows": "Input from 'query' flows into make_llm_request, which communicates with an external language model service, then the result flows back as the function output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual code patterns, and no evident backdoors. Usage of external modules appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules from 'server' and 'utils.llm_call'. It defines an async function decorated with @mcp.tool(), which indicates registration as a tool in some framework. The function accepts a user-provided string 'query', and forwards it to make_llm_request, presumably an API call to an external language model service. The function then returns the AI-generated resolution. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Usage appears consistent with a standard AI-powered help or troubleshooting tool. The only external dependency is make_llm_request, whose security depends on its implementation, but the usage here is straightforward and does not raise concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a straightforward wrapper around an external language model API for processing user issues. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this snippet. The implementation appears legitimate and standard for such a task.",
