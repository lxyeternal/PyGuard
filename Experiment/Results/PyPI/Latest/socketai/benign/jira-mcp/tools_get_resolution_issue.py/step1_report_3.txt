{
  "purpose": "Defines an asynchronous tool function that processes user queries about issues and retrieves resolutions via an external language model API.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'query' from function argument, imported modules 'server' and 'utils.llm_call'.",
  "sinks": "The 'make_llm_request' function likely sends 'query' to an external API, potentially over the network.",
  "flows": "Input 'query' is passed directly to 'make_llm_request', which probably transmits it externally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or malicious code are evident. Usage of async/await appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'mcp' from 'server' and 'make_llm_request' from 'utils.llm_call'. It defines an async function 'get_issue_resolution' decorated with '@mcp.tool()' that forwards user queries to an external LLM request function. The docstring explains purpose and args clearly. No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. The function's main activity is to relay data to an external API, which is common for such tools. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The reliance on external modules for network activity introduces typical security considerations but not malicious intent within this code alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a straightforward wrapper for sending user queries to an external language model API. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks within the provided fragment. Its security profile depends on the implementation of 'make_llm_request', but based on this snippet alone, it appears benign.",
