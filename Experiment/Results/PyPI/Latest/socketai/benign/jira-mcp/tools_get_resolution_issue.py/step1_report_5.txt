{
  "purpose": "Define an asynchronous tool function that processes a user query to generate a resolution using an external language model API.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'server' and 'utils.llm_call'; the 'query' parameter from user input.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'make_llm_request(query)' which likely sends data to an external API.",
  "flows": "User query is received, passed to 'make_llm_request', which sends the data externally and returns the response.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Use of decorators and async functions appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for server interactions and language model requests. It defines an async function 'get_issue_resolution' decorated with '@mcp.tool()' which indicates registration as a tool. The function forwards a user query to 'make_llm_request' and returns the result. No hardcoded credentials, malicious network activity, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code appears to facilitate natural language processing via an external API, with no evident malicious intent or security flaws. Importantly, the code relies on external modules; without their source, we assume they perform standard operations. The structure and formatting are typical for such functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a tool function for processing user queries via an external language model API. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident within this fragment. It appears to be legitimate application code designed for troubleshooting assistance.",
