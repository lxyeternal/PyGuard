{
  "purpose": "Defines an asynchronous function that processes user queries about issues and returns recommended resolutions using an external language model service.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'mcp' from 'server' and 'make_llm_request' from 'utils.llm_call'. It receives 'query' as input parameter from the caller.",
  "sinks": "The 'make_llm_request' function is called with untrusted user input 'query', which may send data to an external API or service. No other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "User provides 'query' -> Passed to 'make_llm_request' -> External API processes query -> Response returned to caller.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No insecure patterns are evident. The code appears straightforward and uses external modules in a typical manner.",
  "analysis": "The code imports external modules and defines an async function decorated as a tool from 'mcp'. The function accepts a user input string 'query' and forwards it directly to 'make_llm_request'. The process involves no data validation or sanitization, but this is expected for such a wrapper function. No indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or backdoors. The external 'make_llm_request' function could potentially transmit user data to third-party services, but that is outside the scope of this snippet. Overall, the code appears standard for an API wrapper with no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward wrapper for forwarding user queries to an external language model API. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident within this code segment. It is a standard implementation for an AI-powered support tool.",
