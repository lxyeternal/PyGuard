  "purpose": "GUI application for converting PDF files to Word documents, managing file selection, output directories, and initiating conversion processes.",
  "sources": "User input via file dialogs and GUI widgets, external modules ('files.interfaz', 'files.functions', 'chromologger') for file handling, messaging, and logging.",
  "sinks": "File dialogs for selecting files/directories, logging to local log file, threading and asyncio for background processing, message boxes for user notifications.",
  "flows": "User triggers functions (fileSet, fileOutSet, convertFile) which invoke external functions and start threads/async tasks for conversion, with updates reflected in GUI labels.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded paths are typical, no obfuscation, no network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard GUI wrapper delegating core functionality to external modules. It uses threading and asyncio appropriately for background tasks. No malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. External modules are assumed safe; internal code is straightforward and well-structured. The security scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's nature and typical for such applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain risks. External dependencies should be audited separately, but within this module, the security posture is sound.",
