{
  "purpose": "The code configures and runs Model Predictive Control (MPC) and explicit MPC for a linear system, including setting bounds, weights, and generating code and plots.",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy and lmpc; data inputs for system matrices A and B; control parameters like bounds and weights; data used in plotting functions.",
  "sinks": "Method calls such as compute_control() and codegen() which could potentially execute control computations or generate code; plotting functions that visualize regions and feedback.",
  "flows": "System matrices A and B are input sources; control parameters are set; control computation is performed via mpc.compute_control(); code is generated via mpc.codegen(); plots are created with empc.plot_regions() and empc.plot_feedback().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behavior detected. Usage of standard libraries and methods appears typical for MPC setup.",
  "analysis": "The script loads necessary modules, defines system matrices, and initializes MPC objects. It sets bounds and weights, performs a control computation, generates code, and creates plots. All steps align with typical control system workflows. No unusual code constructs, data leaks, or malicious patterns are present. The code does not communicate externally, access environment variables insecurely, or perform any suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of MPC setup and visualization, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
