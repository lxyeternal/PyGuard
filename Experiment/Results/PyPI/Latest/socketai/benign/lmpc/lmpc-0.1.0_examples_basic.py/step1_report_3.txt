{
  "purpose": "The code sets up and computes Model Predictive Control (MPC) and explicit MPC using the 'lmpc' library, then generates plots for control feedback regions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for numpy and lmpc; data passed to mpc.set_bounds(), mpc.set_output_bounds(), mpc.set_weights(), mpc.compute_control(), and plotting functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential outputs include control commands and plots. No untrusted data sinks like network transmission or file writing are explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays and parameters through MPC setup and computation functions, culminating in plotting of regions and feedback signals.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Use of standard library functions and external 'lmpc' library appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes matrices A and B for system dynamics. It then creates an MPC object with specified parameters and constraints, computes control actions, and generates plots for regions and feedback. The 'lmpc' library functions are used for control setup and visualization. No obfuscated code, unusual behavior, or suspicious data handling observed. All data inputs and outputs align with typical MPC workflows. No network activity or system manipulation code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard MPC setup, computation, and visualization without any indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate implementation of control algorithms with no malicious intent.",
