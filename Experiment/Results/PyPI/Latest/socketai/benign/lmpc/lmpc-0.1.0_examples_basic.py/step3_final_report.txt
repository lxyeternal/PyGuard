  "purpose": "Setup and visualization of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) system for a linear dynamic model using the 'lmpc' library, including code generation and plotting regions and feedback.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded matrices A and B defining the system dynamics; internal library functions for MPC setup and control computation.",
  "sinks": "No external data inputs, network operations, or file outputs; code generation and plotting are local and standard.",
  "flows": "Data flows from predefined matrices into MPC objects, with control outputs used for plotting; no untrusted data sources or external sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, defines system matrices, configures MPC with bounds and weights, performs control computation, generates code, and visualizes regions and feedback. No external inputs, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The functions used are typical for control applications, and no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for MPC control and visualization with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals and functions are consistent with benign control system implementation. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
