{
  "purpose": "This code sets up and computes model predictive control (MPC) and explicit MPC for a simple linear system, then generates plots of the regions and feedback control.",
  "sources": "Imports 'numpy' and 'lmpc' modules, reads system matrices A and B, and input bounds, output bounds, and weights for MPC configuration.",
  "sinks": "Method calls such as 'compute_control', 'codegen', and plotting functions could potentially generate output or save files, but no data is sent externally or involves untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system matrices and bounds to MPC setup, control computation, code generation, and plotting; no untrusted input flows into vulnerable sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious data, or unusual code constructs. The code appears standard for control setup and visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes system matrices and control parameters, then configures MPC objects, computes control actions, and generates plots. No user inputs or external data are processed dynamically. No obfuscated code, no use of eval or exec. No suspicious file operations or network activity. The code is straightforward and typical for control applications. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of model predictive control setup and visualization without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe with no suspicious behavior or security concerns.",
