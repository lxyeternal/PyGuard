{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up and configuring Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Explicit MPC objects for control system simulation and visualization.",
  "sources": "Import statements for numpy and lmpc; reading control parameters from user input; setting bounds and weights for the MPC object.",
  "sinks": "Calling compute_control and code generation functions; plotting methods that may process and visualize data.",
  "flows": "Input data (matrices, bounds, weights) flows into MPC setup; control commands flow into code generation; data flows into plotting functions for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a control library (lmpc), sets up matrices and control parameters, and performs control computation and visualization. All operations appear consistent with typical MPC workflows. No indications of malicious behavior or security risks such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code uses publicly available library functions in a straightforward manner, and there are no signs of obfuscation or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of control system setup and visualization without any malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical operations associated with MPC configuration and plotting for analysis.",
