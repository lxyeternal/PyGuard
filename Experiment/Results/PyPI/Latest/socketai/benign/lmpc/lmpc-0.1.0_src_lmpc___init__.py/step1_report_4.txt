  "purpose": "Import MPC and ExplicitMPC classes from the local lmpc module",
  "sources": "Local module file 'lmpc' within the package",
  "sinks": "None detected; no external data output or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed; only an import statement without further code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets identified in this import statement",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement importing specific classes from a relative module. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or execute any dynamic code. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident at this stage.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be part of a larger, benign project. Due to limited code, confidence in risk is high, but overall risk is low.",
