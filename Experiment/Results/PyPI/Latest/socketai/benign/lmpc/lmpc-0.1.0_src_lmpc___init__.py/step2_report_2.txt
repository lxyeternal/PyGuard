  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a simple import statement:\n     ```python\n     from .lmpc import MPC, ExplicitMPC\n     ```\n   - It imports two classes from a local module `lmpc`. There are no additional operations, data handling, or dynamic code execution.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - No issues are present in the code itself. The import appears standard and benign.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment: all recognize the code as benign, straightforward, and low risk.\n   - No logical flaws or inaccuracies are evident in the summaries.\n\n4. **Score Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign a very low risk score (mostly 0 or 0.1). Given the absence of any malicious activity or vulnerabilities, this seems appropriate.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent since the code is minimal and standard.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities or exploits, which is appropriate.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The scores and assessments are consistent across reports and align with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified in this snippet.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Since this is only an import statement, the security implications are minimal.\n- If this code is part of a larger project, the security posture depends on the broader context, but based solely on this snippet, there are no concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the observed code and the assessments provided.",
