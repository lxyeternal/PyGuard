{
  "purpose": "Import classes MPC and ExplicitMPC from a local module 'lmpc', likely for control system or MPC algorithm implementation.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no input or data reading occurs in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sinks are involved; the code is a simple import.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only imports classes without executing further logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement, with no dynamic execution, data handling, or network activity. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence scores and zero malware/security risk scores. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The assessments are consistent and justified based on the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious or security concerns. The reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
