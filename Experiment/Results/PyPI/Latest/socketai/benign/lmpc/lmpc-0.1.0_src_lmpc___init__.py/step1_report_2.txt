{
  "purpose": "Import classes MPC and ExplicitMPC from a module named lmpc, likely related to Model Predictive Control implementations.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself reads from the local package/module lmpc.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not process input or output any data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow beyond importing modules/classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement with no evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from a local module, indicating modular design, probably for control system applications. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activities are evident. The simplicity and context suggest standard usage.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears safe and standard.",
