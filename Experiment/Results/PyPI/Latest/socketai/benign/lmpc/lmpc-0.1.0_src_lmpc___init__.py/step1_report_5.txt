  "purpose": "Import MPC and ExplicitMPC classes from the local lmpc module, likely for control or model predictive control functions.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module within the package",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling observed in this snippet",
  "flows": "Imports are used to load classes; no data flow or external data manipulation evident",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward import statement",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from a local module named lmpc. This is a standard Python import syntax. There is no evidence of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious behavior. The snippet is minimal and does not provide additional context for potential malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns evident. It appears to be a standard part of a larger control or MPC system.",
