{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes MPC and ExplicitMPC from a module named lmpc, likely for Model Predictive Control implementations.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from the local package or module 'lmpc'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data, network, or file operations present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable within this snippet as it contains only import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs identified. The import appears standard for a control system package.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from a local module 'lmpc'. There are no other operations, data handling, or side effects. The import suggests use of MPC algorithms, but nothing indicates malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears benign, serving as an import statement for MPC control classes. No malicious or security risks are evident.",
