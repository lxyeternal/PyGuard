{
  "purpose": "Import MPC and ExplicitMPC classes from the local lmpc module, likely for model predictive control operations.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only performing a relative import. No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports two classes from a local module named 'lmpc'. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious operations. The import appears standard for Python projects organizing control algorithms. Since this is only a fragment, the context might be in a larger codebase, but on its own, it shows no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward import statement with no malicious behavior detected. It appears to be a benign part of a larger project related to model predictive control.",
