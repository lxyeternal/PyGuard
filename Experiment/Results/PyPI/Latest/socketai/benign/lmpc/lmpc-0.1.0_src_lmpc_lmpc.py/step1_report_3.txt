{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Explicit MPC interfacing with Julia's LinearMPC library, enabling control computation, setup, constraints, bounds, weights, terminal cost, feedback, code generation, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'numpy', 'types', 'typing', and 'juliacall'; reads include 'jl.VERSION', 'jl.LinearMPC', and 'jl.display'. No user input or external data sources detected.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'jl.LinearMPC' methods and 'jl.display' that produce output or visualization; no untrusted data outputs or network transmissions observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization via 'jl.LinearMPC.MPC' and 'LinearMPC' methods; control computation via 'compute_control'; visualization via 'plot_regions' and 'plot_feedback'. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "Use of the 'juliacall' library to interface with Julia; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code appears to be a wrapper around Julia's MPC functionality, with standard control setup and visualization functions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as a wrapper to interface Python with Julia's LinearMPC library, enabling control calculations and visualization. It uses standard class structures, method calls, and numpy for array handling. No suspicious or malicious code, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The use of external Julia functions is controlled and explicit. There are no signs of code injection, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard interface for control system modeling using Julia's MPC library, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured wrapper without malicious behavior.",
