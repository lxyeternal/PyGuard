  "purpose": "Re-export module for test data utilities, providing access to DEFAULT_OUT_DIR and generate_cms_tests.",
  "sources": "Imports from local module .test_data: DEFAULT_OUT_DIR, generate_cms_tests.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import from .test_data → export via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module that imports two objects from a local module and re-exports them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code execution, input handling, network operations, or security-sensitive logic. The code is straightforward and typical for a utility or interface module. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward re-export module with no security concerns or malicious intent. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
