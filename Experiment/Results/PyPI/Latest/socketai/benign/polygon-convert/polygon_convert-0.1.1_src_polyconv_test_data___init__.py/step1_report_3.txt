  "purpose": "Module for test data related functions and constants.",
  "sources": "Importing DEFAULT_OUT_DIR and generate_cms_tests from a local module named test_data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only importing and defining exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific objects from a local module and exposes them via __all__, serving as an interface. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution. It appears to be a typical module definition for organizing test data utilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely safe and intended for test purposes.",
