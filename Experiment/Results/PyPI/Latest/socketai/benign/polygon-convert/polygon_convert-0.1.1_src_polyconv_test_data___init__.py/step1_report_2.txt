{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a simple interface for test data operations, exposing constants and functions related to test data generation.",
  "sources": "Import from a relative module '.test_data' which provides DEFAULT_OUT_DIR and generate_cms_tests",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output occurs in this code snippet",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow analysis needed as there are no data manipulations or untrusted inputs",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated elements, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports two objects from a local module and defines __all__ for module exports. It does not process any input, perform any network operations, or execute any code that could be malicious. The imported elements are likely functions or constants related to test data generation. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this minimal and straightforward code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module exposing test data utilities with no malicious behavior or security concerns identified. It appears to be a benign component of a larger test suite.",
