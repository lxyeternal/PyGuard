  "sources": "Import statement from local package (.test_data).",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "Import from local module to be used within this module; no data flows externally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple import and export statements, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two objects from a local module named 'test_data' and exports them via __all__. It is a straightforward module setup with no logic, input handling, or data processing. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for a test data utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a simple module setup for test data functions and constants.",
