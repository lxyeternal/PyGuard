{
  "purpose": "This module serves as a wrapper or interface for test data related functions and constants, specifically exposing 'generate_cms_tests' and 'DEFAULT_OUT_DIR'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'DEFAULT_OUT_DIR' and 'generate_cms_tests' from a relative module '.test_data'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions based on external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for module exports. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two identifiers from a local module '.test_data' and exposes them via '__all__'. It is a simple module that facilitates controlled access to specific functions and constants. There is no indication of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues. The code structure is typical for Python modules providing an interface for specific functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving solely as an interface for test data functions and constants. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
