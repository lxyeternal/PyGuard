  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their scoring. Suspicious patterns such as eval, obfuscation, and unvalidated data flows justify moderate malware and risk scores, especially in reports 3 and 5. No confirmed malicious payloads are evident, so scores are kept conservative. Slight adjustments could lower malware risk slightly, but overall, the assessments are appropriate."
