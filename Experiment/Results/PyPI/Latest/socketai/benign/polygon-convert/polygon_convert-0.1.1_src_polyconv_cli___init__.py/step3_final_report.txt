  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security and malicious potential of the provided Python code based on patterns, anomalies, and suspicious behaviors.",
  "sources": "Input reading points such as environment variables, user inputs, file reads, network requests, and dynamic code execution points like eval or exec.",
  "sinks": "Data leaks through network transmission, file writing, environment variable access, or untrusted data handling that could lead to code injection or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "From sources like untrusted input or environment variables to sinks such as network sockets, file systems, or dynamic code execution functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval or exec, hardcoded secrets or credentials, obfuscation signs, unvalidated data flows, suspicious string patterns, or inconsistent code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns of potential malicious behavior when eval or exec are used with untrusted data, especially if obfuscation is present. Hardcoded secrets or credentials increase risk. Minimal or no suspicious patterns suggest benign code. Suspicious behaviors like data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage are indicated by network activity, code obfuscation, or dynamic execution. The scores assigned in the reports align with these observations, with higher malware and obfuscation scores correlating with more suspicious patterns. The overall risk reflects the likelihood of exploitation based on these behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their scoring. Suspicious patterns such as eval, obfuscation, and unvalidated data flows justify moderate malware and risk scores, especially in reports 3 and 5. No confirmed malicious payloads are evident, so scores are kept conservative. Slight adjustments could lower malware risk slightly, but overall, the assessments are appropriate.",
