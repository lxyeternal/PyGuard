{
  "purpose": "The code processes test data from Polygon XML files, copies and renames test files into a CMS format, zips the tests, and generates score parameter strings based on dependencies defined in the XML.",
  "sources": "Reads 'problem.xml' from the specified polygon_path, reads test data, and reads/writes files in the output directory.",
  "sinks": "File system operations such as renaming, copying, deleting directories, creating archives, and writing the score parameters to a file.",
  "flows": "Parses XML to identify tests and dependencies -> copies test files -> renames and organizes them -> creates a zip archive -> generates score parameters string from dependencies and groups.",
  "anomalies": "Uses Template substitution for filenames, which could potentially be exploited if untrusted input is used in 'id' or 'group'. However, 'id' and 'group' are extracted from XML attributes, generally trusted. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No suspicious network activity or external data transmission observed. No obfuscation or malicious code injection detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads and parses XML data for test groups and dependencies, copying test files from a Polygon directory, renaming them according to a CMS format, and packaging them into a zip archive. It also generates a JSON-encoded string representing score parameters. All file operations are standard filesystem manipulations with no dynamic code execution beyond string substitution for filenames. No network, reverse shells, or data exfiltration behaviors are present. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are detected. The Template substitution appears safe since inputs are from trusted XML attributes. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility script for test data organization and packaging. No malicious intent or suspicious behaviors are detected. It performs file operations and XML parsing in a controlled manner, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
