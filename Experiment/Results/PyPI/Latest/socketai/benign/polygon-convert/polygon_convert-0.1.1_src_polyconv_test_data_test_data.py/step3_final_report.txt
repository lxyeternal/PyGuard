{
  "purpose": "The code processes XML-defined tests, copies and renames test files from Polygon format to CMS format, packages them into a zip archive, and generates a JSON string representing subtask dependencies for scoring.",
  "sources": "XML attributes ('name', 'points', 'group'), filesystem operations (reading 'problem.xml', copying directories, renaming files, deleting directories, creating zip archives), and JSON serialization.",
  "sinks": "File system (copying, renaming, deleting directories, creating archives), writing score parameters to a text file.",
  "flows": "XML parsing to extract groups and tests -> dependency resolution via parse_dependencies -> file copying and renaming in rename_tests -> archive creation -> score parameters generation in get_score_params.",
  "anomalies": "Use of shutil.rmtree() for directory cleanup which could be dangerous if paths are externally manipulated; reliance on XML attributes for filenames without sanitization, though context suggests controlled input.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard filesystem and XML parsing operations for test management. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The use of templates and directory operations is typical for such utilities. The only potential risk is directory deletion, which is acceptable within controlled environments. The code's behavior aligns with its purpose, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified and consistent with the observed logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for managing and packaging test data with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk stems from filesystem operations that could be dangerous if inputs are manipulated, but in this context, the code appears safe. The malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0, and the risk score at 0.2 is appropriate.",
