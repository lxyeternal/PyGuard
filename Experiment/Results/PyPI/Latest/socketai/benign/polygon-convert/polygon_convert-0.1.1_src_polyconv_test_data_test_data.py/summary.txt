  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for managing and packaging test data with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk stems from filesystem operations that could be dangerous if inputs are manipulated, but in this context, the code appears safe. The malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0, and the risk score at 0.2 is appropriate."
