{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to copy, rename, and package tests from a Polygon XML format into a CMS format, generating a score parameters string for use in a contest or testing framework.",
  "sources": "Reads 'problem.xml' to parse test groups, test definitions, and dependencies; reads and writes files in specified directories; reads and writes 'score_params.txt'.",
  "sinks": "Writes 'score_params.txt'; creates zip archives of test files; renames files within the filesystem; reads XML data from 'problem.xml'.",
  "flows": "Reads test and group data from XML; processes dependencies; writes 'score_params.txt'; copies and renames test files; creates zip archive with renamed tests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed. Uses standard libraries and straightforward file operations. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs file operations, XML parsing, and template-based renaming. It handles dependencies via recursive functions, generates a JSON-formatted score parameter string, and manages test file copying and zipping. All operations are standard and appear consistent with expected functionality for test preparation. No code indicates malicious intent such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or covert communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for preparing contest tests in a specific format, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It employs standard libraries and practices, with no suspicious patterns detected.",
