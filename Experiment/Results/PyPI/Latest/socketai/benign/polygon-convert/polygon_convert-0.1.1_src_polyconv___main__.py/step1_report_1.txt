{
  "purpose": "Main entry point for the polyconv CLI tool, intended to execute the main function from the polyconv.cli.main module when run as a script.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import from polyconv.cli.main and the execution trigger __name__ == '__main__'.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform any data output.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: when executed as a script, it calls the main() function imported from polyconv.cli.main.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code is minimal and standard for a CLI entry point.",
  "analysis": "This script imports the main function from a specific module and executes it if the script is run directly. It contains no input handling, no data processing, and no network operations. It appears to be a typical CLI entry point with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard entry point for a CLI application with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply delegates execution to the imported main function. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are present.",
