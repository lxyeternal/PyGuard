  "sinks": "Execution of main() if script is run directly",
  "flows": "Import of 'main' -> Execution of main() in __main__ guard",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual constructs. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function and executes it if the script is run as the main program. It functions as a typical CLI entry point, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code execution. The simplicity and standard pattern indicate no malicious intent or security issues within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign entry point for a CLI application with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
