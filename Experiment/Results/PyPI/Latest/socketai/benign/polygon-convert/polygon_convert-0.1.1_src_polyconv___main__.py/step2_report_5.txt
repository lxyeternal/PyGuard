  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code snippets are all very similar: they import a `main` function from `polyconv.cli.main` and invoke it under the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` guard.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is a standard CLI entry point with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0 or 0.9), indicating that the reviewers believe these snippets are benign.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, obfuscated scores are 0, and security risks are 0, aligning with the analysis.\n\n**Confirming issues in the code:**\n\n- The code itself is minimal, straightforward, and typical for CLI applications.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- Since the actual implementation of `main()` is not provided, we cannot assess what it does internally. However, based on the snippet, there's no evidence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n- They correctly identify that this is a simple launcher script with no apparent security issues.\n\n**Scores review:**\n\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are reasonable given the code.\n- The high confidence levels support the conclusion that these snippets are benign.\n\n**Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n\n- Since the code is purely a launcher with no embedded logic, no external inputs, and no suspicious constructs, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The malware score is 0 because there's no indication of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 because the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The overall security risk is 0, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n\n- If the imported `main()` function performs malicious actions internally, that cannot be determined from this snippet alone. However, since the reports focus solely on this code, and there's no evidence of maliciousness here, it’s reasonable to keep the scores low.\n- The reports do not assume malicious behavior; they only describe the code structure.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a minimal, standard CLI entry point with no suspicious features.  \n- No malicious activity can be inferred from this snippet alone.  \n- The actual behavior depends on the implementation of `main()`, which is outside this scope, but given the evidence, no concern warrants raising the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, straightforward, and aligns with typical Python CLI patterns. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
