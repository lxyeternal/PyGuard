  "purpose": "Main entry point for the polyconv CLI application",
  "sources": "Importing main function from polyconv.cli.main; execution trigger via __name__ == '__main__'",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() function when script runs as main module",
  "flows": "When executed, the script calls the main() function imported from polyconv.cli.main",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code structures; straightforward CLI entry point",
  "analysis": "The code imports a main function from a submodule and executes it if the script is run directly. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code relies on the imported main() to perform CLI operations. Since this is a standard entry point pattern, no malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical CLI entry point with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply delegates execution to the main() function of the polyconv package.",
