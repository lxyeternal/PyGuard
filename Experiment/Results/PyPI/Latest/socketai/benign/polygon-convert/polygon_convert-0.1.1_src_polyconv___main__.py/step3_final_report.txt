{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the main entry point for the polyconv CLI application, delegating execution to the imported main() function.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports a function from polyconv.cli.main.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the script execution to the main() function call; no further data flow is present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI entry point that imports and executes main(). It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The actual behavior depends on the implementation of main(), which is outside this snippet. Given the simplicity and standard pattern, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign CLI launcher with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriate at 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), and the code is not obfuscated or malicious.",
  "confidence": 1,
