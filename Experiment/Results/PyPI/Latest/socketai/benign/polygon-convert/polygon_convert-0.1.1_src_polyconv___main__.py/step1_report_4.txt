  "purpose": "Main entry point for the polyconv CLI application",
  "sources": "Importing main function from polyconv.cli.main module",
  "sinks": "Calling the main() function when executed as script",
  "flows": "Execution starts if __name__ == '__main__', then invokes main()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function 'main' from the polyconv.cli.main module and executes it if the script is run directly. There are no input or data reading sources within this code snippet. The flow is standard for CLI entry points. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The structure adheres to common Python CLI practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI entry point with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely delegates execution to the imported main() function, which is outside the scope of this snippet.",
