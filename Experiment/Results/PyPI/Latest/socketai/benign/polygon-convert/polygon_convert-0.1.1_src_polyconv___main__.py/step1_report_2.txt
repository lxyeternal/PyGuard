{
  "purpose": "Main entry point for the polyconv CLI tool, invoking the main function from the polyconv.cli.main module.",
  "sources": "The module import statement importing 'main' from 'polyconv.cli.main', and the execution block that calls 'main()' if the script is run directly.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'main()', which may execute code defined elsewhere in the 'polyconv.cli.main' module.",
  "flows": "The script imports a function and then executes it directly, passing control to the imported 'main' function when run.",
  "anomalies": "The code itself is minimal and straightforward; no suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "analysis": "This script serves as an entry point, primarily for CLI execution. It imports the main function from a package module and calls it if the script is run directly. There are no data inputs, network connections, or processing logic shown here. Since the actual 'main' function's implementation is not provided, this code acts as a simple launcher with no apparent malicious behavior. No suspicious or anomalous code elements are visible in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a basic CLI entry point, delegating execution to another module. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment.",
