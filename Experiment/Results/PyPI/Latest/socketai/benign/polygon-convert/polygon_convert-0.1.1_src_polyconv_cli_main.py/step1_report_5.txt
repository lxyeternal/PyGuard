  "purpose": "Provides a command line interface for polygon_convert to generate CMS test data from a specified Polygon package folder.",
  "sources": "Reads command line arguments (polygon_path, --force, --out). Uses generate_cms_tests from polyconv.test_data to generate test data based on the provided path.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no data is sent over the network, written to files, or used in insecure system commands.",
  "flows": "User inputs polygon_path, optional overwrite flag and output directory → generate_test_data processes these inputs → generate_cms_tests function is called with these parameters → results are printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or unusual code constructs. Use of standard libraries and straightforward function calls.",
  "analysis": "The script is a CLI wrapper around generate_cms_tests, mainly parsing user input and calling a function. No suspicious data handling, no network activity, no system modification code. Error handling is limited to file existence and value errors, which are typical for CLI tools. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation. It appears to be a utility script with safe and intended functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI interface for a testing utility, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply processes input parameters, calls an external function, and outputs the result. No security concerns detected.",
