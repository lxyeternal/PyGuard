  "purpose": "This code provides a command-line interface for polygon_convert, allowing users to generate CMS test data from Polygon package folders.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from command line arguments: 'polygon_path', '--out', and '--force'.",
  "sinks": "Potential output to the console via print statements; no direct sinks for untrusted data. No network or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are used to resolve paths and pass data to generate_cms_tests, with output printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No signs of malicious intent or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up argument parsing, resolves paths securely, and calls an external function generate_cms_tests. Error handling is limited to catching specific exceptions and printing messages. There are no network, file manipulations, or suspicious code patterns. The code's behavior appears straightforward, focusing solely on generating test data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI wrapper for a test data generation function, with no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
