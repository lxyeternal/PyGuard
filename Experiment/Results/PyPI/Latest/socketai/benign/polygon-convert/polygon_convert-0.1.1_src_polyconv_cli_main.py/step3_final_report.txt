  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for polygon_convert that parses arguments and calls generate_cms_tests.",
  "sources": "User input for polygon_path and optional flags; Path resolution of polygon_path.",
  "sinks": "External function generate_cms_tests (assumed safe), no direct sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> Path resolution -> generate_cms_tests call.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility that accepts user input, resolves paths securely, and calls an external function. It handles exceptions for specific errors and outputs results. No network activity, file tampering, or malicious payloads are present. The external function's safety is assumed based on its import from a trusted module. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are observed. The malware score is appropriately 0, and the security risk is minimal, around 0.1, due to reliance on external code and path handling, but no actual security flaw exists.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and safe. It performs no malicious actions or obfuscation. The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
