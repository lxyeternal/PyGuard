{
  "purpose": "Provides a command line interface for polygon_convert to generate test data and CMS score parameters from a specified Polygon package folder.",
  "sources": "Reads command line arguments ('polygon_path', '--force', '--out') and the imported 'generate_cms_tests' function.",
  "fires": "Uses 'generate_cms_tests' with user-specified paths; no untrusted external data sources, network communication, or sensitive info access.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> 'polygon_path' and options -> 'generate_cms_tests' function -> output score parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual control flow; no obfuscated code or indirect code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly parses user input and calls an external function 'generate_cms_tests'. There is no evidence of malicious payload, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. Error handling is limited to file existence and value errors, with no external communications or unsafe operations observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a CLI wrapper to generate test data for a Polygon package. It does not contain malware or malicious intent, nor does it perform any insecure operations. It appears safe and legitimate.",
