  "purpose": "Provide a command line interface for polygon_convert to generate CMS test data from Polygon package folders.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command line arguments: 'polygon_path', '--force', '--out'.",
  "sinks": "Path resolution and test data generation functions that could handle user input; no unsafe sinks identified.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> Path resolution and argument parsing -> generate_cms_tests function call with user-provided paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behaviors. The code uses standard libraries and functions. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs argument parsing, path resolution, and calls an external function generate_cms_tests with user-supplied paths. It handles exceptions for FileExistsError and ValueError. No unsafe or malicious code constructs are present. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The functions and modules used are standard and appear to be benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper for a test data generation process, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external functions that are assumed to be safe. There is no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
