The current scores are generally appropriate, with a slight increase in malware suspicion for Report 4 to better match its suspicious patterns. Overall, the dependency appears low risk, with targeted attention needed for suspicious patterns in specific reports."

Suspicious patterns such as eval, obfuscation, and unvalidated data flows justify moderate malware and risk scores, especially in reports 3 and 5. No confirmed malicious payloads are evident, so scores are kept conservative. Slight adjustments could lower malware risk slightly, but overall, the assessments are appropriate."

The low security risk stems from filesystem operations that could be dangerous if inputs are manipulated, but in this context, the code appears safe. The malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0, and the risk score at 0.2 is appropriate."
