  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low security risk; Report 4 shows moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic code patterns, warranting a higher malware score. The current scores are generally appropriate, with a slight increase in malware suspicion for Report 4 to better match its suspicious patterns. Overall, the dependency appears low risk, with targeted attention needed for suspicious patterns in specific reports."
