  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be related to data processing or system interaction, but no explicit comments or documentation clarify its intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, and possibly from external files or network sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writes, or system commands that could handle sensitive data or execute system-level operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources or environment variables through processing functions to sinks such as network transmissions, file operations, or command executions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation are detected. There is minimal or straightforward code structure with no unusual language features or misleading variable names. No obfuscated or dynamically generated code was identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with standard Python constructs. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system damage, or covert channels are evident. Usage of third-party libraries appears benign. No insecure practices like unsafe SQL or code injection are observed. The code flow is typical for data handling, with no signs of hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to be normal application logic without any harmful or sabotage elements. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the clarity and lack of suspicious patterns.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
