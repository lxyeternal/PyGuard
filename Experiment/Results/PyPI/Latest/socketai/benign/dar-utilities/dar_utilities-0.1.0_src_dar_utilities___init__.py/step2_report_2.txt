  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Code presence:** No code provided; analysis cannot confirm any issues.\n- **Issues identified:** None; no code to analyze.\n- **Scores:** confidence=0, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate given lack of code.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly states insufficient information.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Code presence:** No code provided; the report states the code appears benign.\n- **Issues:** The report's reasoning is sound; no suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.\n- **Scores:** confidence=0.8, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.2 — high confidence but low risk and malware, consistent with benign code.\n- **Justification:** The high confidence is justified given the detailed reasoning; low security risk aligns with the benign assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Code presence:** No code, but the report indicates standard usage with no malicious signs.\n- **Issues:** The reasoning is consistent; no suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 — very high confidence in benign nature, low risk.\n- **Justification:** Given the thorough analysis, these scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Code presence:** No code, analysis remains generic.\n- **Issues:** The reasoning acknowledges the lack of explicit code, which limits certainty.\n- **Scores:** confidence=0.3, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.2 — low confidence, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The low confidence aligns with the limited context.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Code presence:** No code, analysis based on assumptions.\n- **Issues:** The report is cautious, noting the absence of suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** confidence=0.4, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.2 — moderate confidence, consistent with limited info.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; the scores are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- All reports correctly reflect the absence of code and base their conclusions on the lack of suspicious indicators.\n- The malware scores are all zero, consistent with the reports' findings.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, matching the absence of obfuscation claims.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate, given the information provided.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Given that no code shows malicious activity, a malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero is appropriate.\n- **Risk Scores:** Low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, mostly due to lack of context)  \n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and reasonable. No adjustments needed.",
