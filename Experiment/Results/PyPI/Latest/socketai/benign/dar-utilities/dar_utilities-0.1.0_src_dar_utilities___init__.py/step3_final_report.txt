  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "No explicit code provided; analysis based on descriptions and context.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable due to absence of code; potential data flows are inferred from code descriptions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no actual code to trace data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; all reports lack code snippets, limiting analysis.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code and malicious indicators. Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the benign descriptions. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited information. Security risk scores are low, but could be conservatively set to zero for clarity, as no code or suspicious activity is present. The scores are internally consistent and reflect the benign assessment. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected across the reports.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports accurately reflect the lack of malicious or obfuscated code, with low security risks. Given the absence of actual code snippets, the assessments are inherently limited but reasonable. The overall security posture appears benign, with no signs of supply chain compromise.",
