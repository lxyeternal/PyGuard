  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility functions, but the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments, environment variables, or imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, subprocess executions, or data returned to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to sinks such as network or file systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or unnecessary dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code has a standard structure with typical import statements, function definitions, and data handling routines. No evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network calls. No hidden or obfuscated code identified. Usage of standard libraries and functions suggests legitimate intent. Without more context or external dependencies, no malicious behavior is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign based on the provided content. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk score is low, but further context could enhance certainty.",
