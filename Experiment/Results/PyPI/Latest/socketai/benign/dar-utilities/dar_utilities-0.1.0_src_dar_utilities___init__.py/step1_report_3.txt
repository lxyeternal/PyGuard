  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script performing specific data processing or utility functions. No explicit purpose indicating malicious activity is evident.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, user input via functions like input(), and reads from files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing output, writing to files, executing system commands, or network communication if implemented.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like file writing or network transmission, if present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual behavior observed. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs identified. Code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis shows standard usage of Python functions and modules. No malicious imports or obfuscated parts. No suspicious code patterns such as dynamic execution or hidden backdoors. The code's structure is typical and does not exhibit signs of malicious intent. The absence of external connections, data exfiltration, or harmful system modifications suggests this is benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a normal Python script without indicators of sabotage or malicious activity.",
