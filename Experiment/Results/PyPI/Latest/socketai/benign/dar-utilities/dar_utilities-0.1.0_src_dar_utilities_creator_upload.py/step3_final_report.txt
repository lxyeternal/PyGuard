{
  "purpose": "The code creates and uploads a dataset draft to the eLTER DAR platform, handling metadata, files, and authentication tokens.",
  "sources": "Reading metadata JSON file, token file or environment variable, data files from specified directory.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST and PUT requests to external API endpoints for creating drafts, registering files, uploading content, and committing files.",
  "flows": "Metadata and token are read from disk or environment, then API requests are made to create a draft, register files, upload file contents, and finalize the draft.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries and practices for API interaction, with proper validation of input files and environment variables. It manages tokens securely, performs typical file uploads, and handles errors appropriately. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The logic flow is straightforward and aligns with expected behavior for such a client.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured dataset upload client with no indications of malicious intent or obfuscation. It handles credentials securely and interacts with the API in a standard manner. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero.",
