  "purpose": "This script automates the creation and upload of a dataset draft to the eLTER Data Access Repository, including metadata loading, file registration, and content upload.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from files specified via command-line arguments, including metadata files, data directories, and optional token files. Loads metadata JSON from a file.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP requests to a remote API endpoint, including authorization headers with tokens, and uploads file content via PUT requests. Reads token data from a file or environment variable.",
  "flows": "Token is obtained from a file or environment variable -> Metadata JSON is loaded from a file -> HTTP requests are made to create a draft -> Files are registered -> Files are uploaded -> Files are committed.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code or unusual language constructs observed. Use of environment variables for token retrieval is standard. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The code uses standard libraries and external requests library without suspicious functions.",
  "analysis": "The code reads sensitive data (token) from a file or environment variable, uses it to authorize API requests, and uploads files to a remote server. It performs input validation on files and directories, handles HTTP responses appropriately, and logs errors. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system sabotage. The HTTP requests are directed to known URLs for dataset management, with no indication of malicious domains. The process appears to be a legitimate data upload operation. No malicious behavior, such as code injection, system compromise, or privacy violations, is evident. The use of external requests library is standard for such operations. Overall, the code appears to be a typical data upload script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs dataset creation and upload via authenticated API calls, with proper input validation and error handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The code appears to be legitimate and safe for its intended purpose.",
