{
  "purpose": "The code facilitates the creation and uploading of a dataset draft to an external API (elter-ri.eu), including metadata and data files, with authentication via a token.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from: metadata file specified by --metadata, data directory specified by --data, and optional token file specified by --token or environment variable DAR_API_TOKEN.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP POST and PUT requests to the API endpoints with JSON payloads and file data; reads token from file or environment variable; reads metadata and files from disk.",
  "flows": "Input sources (metadata file, data directory, token) are validated and read; token used in API request headers; metadata loaded and sent in API request; files are registered and uploaded; each step depends on previous successful response.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard libraries without obfuscation; no hardcoded secrets other than token management; no suspicious network endpoints or code execution; no dynamic code or obfuscated patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration and data files securely with validation checks; manages API tokens either from file or environment variable; uses requests_toolbelt sessions for HTTP interactions; performs typical dataset creation and file upload workflows; no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration; error handling is present; no unusual code patterns or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for dataset uploading, with proper validation and standard usage of libraries. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a straightforward API interaction script with no malicious or suspicious features.",
