{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to automate the creation of dataset drafts on an external system via API, including uploading metadata and data files.",
  "sources": "Reads the metadata file from a specified path, reads the API token from a file or environment variable, reads data files from a directory, and reads responses from network requests.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to the API endpoints for dataset creation, file registration, file upload, and commit actions; reading token and metadata files.",
  "flows": "Input sources (metadata file, token file, data directory) flow into API requests for dataset creation, file registration, uploading, and committing; responses determine success or errors.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The code properly handles token retrieval and file reading, with no evident malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API interactions for dataset creation and file upload workflows. It securely reads the API token from a file or environment variable, verifies file existence, and performs HTTP requests with proper headers. No code injections, data leaks, or malicious logic are present. No suspicious external network communications aside from expected API interactions. The use of external libraries is justified for HTTP requests. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate utility for dataset upload automation. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. The code properly manages credentials, verifies inputs, and performs expected API interactions without malicious or suspicious behavior.",
