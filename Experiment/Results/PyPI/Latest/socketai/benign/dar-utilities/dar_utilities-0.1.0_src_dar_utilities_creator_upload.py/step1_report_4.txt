{
  "purpose": "This script automates the creation of a dataset draft on an external API, uploads associated files, and manages authentication and file handling.",
  "sources": "Reads API token from a file or environment variable, reads metadata JSON from a file, reads data files from a directory.",
  "sinks": "Uses the token for authorization in HTTP headers; sends JSON data and file contents via POST and PUT requests to external API endpoints.",
  "flows": "Token source (file/env) -> Headers in HTTP requests; Metadata file content -> API request payload; Data files -> uploaded via HTTP PUT requests; File registration data -> API registration endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials or secrets within the code; token handling is standard and safely read from file or environment.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API interactions: loading metadata, registering files, uploading file content, and finalizing dataset creation. It uses environment variables or external files for sensitive data, with proper checks for file existence. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors, such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system modifications, are present. The logic is straightforward and appears intended solely for dataset management. No hidden or obfuscated code patterns are evident. The only potential concern might be if the API endpoint or token were compromised externally, but that is outside this code's control and not indicative of malicious intent within this script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate dataset upload utility that follows standard practices for handling sensitive information and file uploads. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. Overall, it is a typical, secure, and purpose-driven script.",
