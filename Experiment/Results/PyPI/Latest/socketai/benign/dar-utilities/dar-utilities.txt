      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI setup script that delegates core functionality to external modules. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities within this snippet. The overall security posture depends on the external 'creator' module's trustworthiness, but based solely on this code, it is safe. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal security risk reflects reliance on external modules."

      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured dataset upload client with no indications of malicious intent or obfuscation. It handles credentials securely and interacts with the API in a standard manner. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero."
