  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward CLI argument parser setup.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks is identified.\n- The import from a relative module (.upload) is standard practice within packages, though it could potentially hide malicious code if the module itself is compromised. However, based solely on this snippet, there's no indication of malicious intent.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across reports, aligning with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- The security risk scores are very low (0.1 or 0), reflecting minimal concern based on the provided code.\n\n**Confirmations & Potential Issues:**\n- The code does not contain any errors, flaws, or mistakes.\n- The logic is sound and typical for CLI setup.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present.\n- The import from `.upload` is standard but could be scrutinized further if the imported module contains malicious code, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n**Score assessments:**\n- Malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- Risk scores are very low, which is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to scores are necessary based on the provided code and reports.\n- The overall security posture appears sound, with no immediate concerns.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but 0.1 is acceptable given the minimal risk)\n\n**Final note:**\n- While the code appears safe, vigilance should be maintained regarding the contents of the `.upload` module, which could introduce risks if malicious. However, based solely on this snippet, there are no security issues.",
