  "purpose": "Configure command-line argument parser for dataset upload functionality.",
  "sources": "Input source is the command-line arguments provided by the user; the import of a local module (.upload).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is directly processed in a way that leads to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow through argparse setup; no dangerous data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual code structures. The imported module (.upload) is not analyzed here, which could contain additional risks.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an argument parser with a subparser for an upload command and calls a configuration function from a local module. It relies on user input via command line. No suspicious behaviors or malicious code patterns are visible. The code is straightforward and typical for CLI setup, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The import statement suggests further functionality resides in the local module, but it is not inspected here. There are no network operations, file manipulations, or sensitive data handling in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard CLI parser setup with no evident malicious behavior or security risks based on its content. The code appears safe, but the security of the overall package depends on the implementation of the imported .upload module.",
