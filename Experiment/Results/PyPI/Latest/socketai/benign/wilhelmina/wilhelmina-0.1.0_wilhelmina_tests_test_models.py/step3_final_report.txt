  "purpose": "Unit tests for message, sender, and message list models to verify attribute correctness, exception handling, and timestamp formatting.",
  "sources": "Controlled test data dictionaries used to instantiate models.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, network calls, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of models with static data; attribute assertions and exception checks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward unit testing with static, controlled inputs. No external or untrusted data sources are used. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The tests verify model attributes, exception raising, and timestamp formatting. All signals indicate benign, standard testing code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard test suite for data models with no security risks or malicious intent. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk are appropriately zero.",
