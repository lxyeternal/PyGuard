  "purpose": "Unit tests for models in wilma.models, verifying data handling and model behaviors.",
  "sources": "Test data defined within the test functions, such as dictionaries passed to model constructors.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from test input dictionaries to model instantiations, with no further data processing or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test functions that instantiate data models with hardcoded, controlled test data and perform assertions. No external input, network calls, or dynamic code execution is present. The test data is static and used purely for validation. The models and tests appear standard for data validation and do not include any suspicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of unit tests for data models, with no malicious intent or security risks. No signs of supply chain attacks, malware, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
