The function simply calls the handle method on the input HTML string. There are no sources of untrusted data besides the input parameter. No external network connections, file access, or system commands are present. The configuration options are standard and do not introduce security concerns. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward utility with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple utility for converting HTML to Markdown and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It operates in a controlled manner without external interactions or unsafe code practices.",
