  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting HTML content to Markdown format using the html2text library.",
  "sources": "The function takes HTML content as input (parameter 'html').",
  "sinks": "The code processes input through html2text's handle() method, which outputs Markdown content.",
  "flows": "Input HTML -> html2text handle() -> Markdown output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscation detected. The code primarily configures a third-party library and uses it straightforwardly.",
  "analysis": "The code imports html2text and configures an instance with specific settings. It defines a function that converts HTML to Markdown by calling the handle() method of the configured converter. The configuration appears to set properties related to output formatting and link handling, without any dynamic or unsafe behavior. The function is a simple wrapper around a library call, with no input validation or manipulation that could lead to injection or leakage. There are no suspicious data flows or anomalous code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for HTML to Markdown conversion. It uses a well-known library in a straightforward manner without any malicious intent or security risks.",
