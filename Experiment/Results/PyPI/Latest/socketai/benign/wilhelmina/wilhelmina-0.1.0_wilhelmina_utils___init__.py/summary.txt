  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for converting HTML to Markdown with no malicious intent or security flaws. The main risk stems from handling untrusted HTML, which is outside the scope of this utility. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the inherent risks of processing untrusted HTML content but not due to the code itself."
