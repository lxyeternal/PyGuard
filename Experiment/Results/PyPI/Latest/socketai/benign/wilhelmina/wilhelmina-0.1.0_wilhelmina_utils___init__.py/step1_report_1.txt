  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting HTML content to Markdown format in the Wilma client.",
  "sources": "The function receives HTML content as input parameter.",
  "sinks": "The handle method of html2text.HTML2Text processes the HTML input; potential sink if the input is untrusted or malicious HTML.",
  "flows": "Input HTML -> html_to_markdown function -> _html_converter.handle(html) -> returns Markdown output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or obfuscated code, no unusual behavior. Use of standard library html2text is typical for such tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library (html2text) for HTML to Markdown conversion. It configures the converter with typical settings, such as not wrapping lines, preserving Unicode, and protecting links. The function simply wraps the handle method to process input HTML content. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code. The only potential concern is if untrusted HTML is passed, which could include malicious scripts, but this is a normal risk associated with processing HTML content and not specific to malicious code within the script itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility function for converting HTML to Markdown with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on a standard library and performs straightforward processing.",
