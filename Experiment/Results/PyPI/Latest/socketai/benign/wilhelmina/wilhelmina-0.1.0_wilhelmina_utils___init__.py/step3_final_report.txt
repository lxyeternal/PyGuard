  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting HTML content to Markdown format.",
  "sources": "The function html_to_markdown receives HTML content as input.",
  "sinks": "The handle() method processes the HTML content; no external sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "Input HTML flows directly into html2text.HTML2Text.handle() without sanitization or validation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and uses standard library configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple wrapper around the html2text library, configured with typical options. It processes untrusted HTML input directly, which could contain malicious scripts, but this is a known risk of HTML handling, not a flaw in the code. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or network activity. The configuration and implementation are standard, and the code does not perform any dynamic execution or external calls. The security concerns are primarily related to the content being processed, not the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for converting HTML to Markdown with no malicious intent or security flaws. The main risk stems from handling untrusted HTML, which is outside the scope of this utility. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the inherent risks of processing untrusted HTML content but not due to the code itself.",
