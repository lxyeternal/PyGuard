{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for messages in Wilma API, including sender details and message content.",
  "sources": "Data imported from external modules ('mashumaro', 'wilma.utils'), and class attributes initialized from API responses.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly processes untrusted input into sensitive operations; potential concern if content_html is used unsafely elsewhere.",
  "flows": "No direct data flows involving untrusted input leading to sensitive actions within this code. 'content_html' could potentially be unsafe if used improperly elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded credentials. The 'content_html' is processed with 'html_to_markdown', which might be unsafe if the HTML input is malicious, but this depends on the implementation of 'html_to_markdown' outside this code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data classes for messages and senders, with no dynamic execution or network operations. It uses standard library modules and external utilities for data transformation. The 'content_html' field, which can contain untrusted HTML, is converted to Markdown; however, the safety depends on the implementation of 'html_to_markdown'. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present in this snippet. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs are identified. The code appears to be a straightforward data model with formatting utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily data modeling with no evident malicious intent or security risks. The only minor consideration is ensuring that 'html_to_markdown' handles potentially malicious HTML safely, but this is outside the scope of this snippet. Overall, the code appears safe and standard.",
