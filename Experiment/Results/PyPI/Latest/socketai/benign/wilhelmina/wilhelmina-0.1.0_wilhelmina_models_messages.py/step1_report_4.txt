  "purpose": "Define message models for Wilma API, including serialization, timestamp formatting, and content conversion.",
  "sources": "Imported modules (mashumaro, datetime, wilma.utils), class attributes, and methods accessing data fields.",
  "sinks": "html_to_markdown function (potentially processes HTML content), string formatting/parsing in format_timestamp.",
  "flows": "Content_html -> html_to_markdown; timestamp string -> datetime.strptime",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of standard libraries and straightforward data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for message handling, including serialization with mashumaro, timestamp parsing, and HTML to Markdown conversion. The only external function used, html_to_markdown, appears to be a utility for content formatting. No suspicious or malicious code such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present. The timestamp parsing and content formatting are typical operations. The code appears to be for data modeling and presentation, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard data modeling for message representation with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain obfuscation or malware features.",
