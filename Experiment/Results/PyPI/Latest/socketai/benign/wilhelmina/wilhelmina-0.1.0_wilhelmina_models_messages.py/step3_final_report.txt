  "purpose": "Data models for messages and senders, including timestamp parsing and content formatting.",
  "sources": "API response fields such as 'timestamp' and 'content_html'.",
  "sinks": "html_to_markdown function processing 'content_html'.",
  "flows": "content_html -> html_to_markdown",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for message entities, with timestamp parsing and content conversion. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or hardcoded secrets are present. The only external utility is 'html_to_markdown', which could pose risks if it does not sanitize HTML, but this depends on its implementation outside this code. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious logic. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk between 0.1 and 0.2) are consistent with the code's nature and potential content rendering concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minor security risk pertains to processing untrusted HTML content, which is a common and manageable concern outside the code itself. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
