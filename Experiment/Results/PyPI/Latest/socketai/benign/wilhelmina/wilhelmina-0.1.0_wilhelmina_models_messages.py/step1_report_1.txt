  "purpose": "Define data models for Wilma API message objects, including sender information, individual messages, and message lists.",
  "sources": "Input data from API responses mapped to data class fields; html_to_markdown function imported for content processing.",
  "sinks": "html_to_markdown processing; no other explicit sinks or data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "API response data → data class fields (e.g., timestamp, content_html) → html_to_markdown (for content_markdown property).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. The code is straightforward data modeling. The only notable operation is html_to_markdown, which is a standard content conversion.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for message handling with clear separation of concerns. The timestamp parsing uses standard datetime parsing, and content conversion relies on an imported utility. No untrusted data manipulation beyond standard data structure assignments. No apparent code injection, malicious network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for data modeling and content formatting with no malicious behavior. It appears safe and follows standard practices. No security risks identified.",
