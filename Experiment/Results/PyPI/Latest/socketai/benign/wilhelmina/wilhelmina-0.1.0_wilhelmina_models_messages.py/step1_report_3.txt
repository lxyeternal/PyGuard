{
  "purpose": "Define data models for Wilma API message objects, including message details, sender info, and message list.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class attributes and imported functions, notably the 'html_to_markdown' function from 'wilma.utils'.",
  "sinks": "The only potential sink is the 'content_markdown' property, which processes 'content_html' through 'html_to_markdown'.",
  "flows": "Input from 'content_html' flows through 'html_to_markdown' in 'content_markdown' property, but this is a standard processing function, not a sink for untrusted data leading to security risk.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code uses standard dataclass structures and a common HTML-to-Markdown conversion.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models for message objects with attributes mapped from API responses, including sender info and message content. The 'content_html' is processed into Markdown via 'html_to_markdown', a utility function. There are no signs of malicious code, code injection, or data leaks. No external inputs or outputs are directly manipulated in a way that would indicate security risks. The HTML content is passed to an external utility, which should be trusted to sanitize inputs, but this is a standard content conversion step. No hardcoded secrets, network activities, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data model with safe content processing; no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It functions as intended for data handling with no security risks.",
