  "purpose": "This code implements a client for the Wilma API, handling login, message retrieval, and session management.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters, cookies from HTTP responses, and environment variables indirectly via HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to API endpoints, cookie handling, and potential data exposure via responses and headers.",
  "flows": "User input (username, password) → login process → session cookies → authenticated API requests → message content retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious URL manipulation, no obfuscated code, and no unusual or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard patterns for an API client with session management, login, and message parsing. It employs playwright for page scraping only if available, and handles cookies securely within context. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden network connections. The code does interact with external web pages and APIs, but these are consistent with intended functionality. No hardcoded secrets are found. The only notable behavior is the optional use of playwright for unread message detection, which is a legitimate use of web scraping tools. No suspicious code injections, obfuscation, or covert data collection mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client implementation with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It manages sessions securely and does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns. The overall security risk score is low, with no malware detected.",
