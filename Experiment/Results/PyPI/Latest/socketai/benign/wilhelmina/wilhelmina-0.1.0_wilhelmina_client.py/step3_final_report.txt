{
  "purpose": "A Python client for Wilma API handling login, message retrieval, and session management, with optional web scraping for unread messages.",
  "sources": "Cookies from HTTP responses, response headers, HTML content from Playwright, user input for login credentials.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request headers (Wilma2SID cookie), network requests to Wilma endpoints, HTML parsing for message IDs.",
  "flows": "Login response cookies -> stored in session -> used in subsequent requests and Playwright cookies -> HTML content parsed for message IDs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of optional Playwright for HTML scraping; URL string formatting with placeholders; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard session management, login via cookies, and message retrieval. It uses Playwright for dynamic content scraping, which is a legitimate technique. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity are present. Error handling is appropriate, and the code structure is clear. The optional dependencies and web scraping do not indicate malicious intent but could be misused if environment is compromised. Overall, the code is a typical API client with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Wilma API client with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score is justified given its functionality. No evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage is detected.",
