  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a Wilma API client with login, message retrieval, and session management. It uses cookies, response headers, and BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing. Playwright is optional for unread message detection.\n\n- **Key points:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard session handling, no signs of malicious activity. It performs web scraping for unread messages, which is typical.\n\n- **Security implications:** The code handles cookies and headers securely, and the logic is consistent with standard practices. No malware or sabotage detected.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low). The overall conclusion aligns with the technical assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API client behavior, session management, and HTML parsing for unread messages. No malicious code or secrets.\n\n- **Key points:** Use of Playwright is optional and used for scraping, which is standard. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Security implications:** No backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. The code appears legitimate.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard Wilma API client with login, message retrieval, and session management. Uses cookies, response headers, and HTML parsing.\n\n- **Key points:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard cookie handling, and no malicious patterns.\n\n- **Security implications:** No signs of malicious behavior. The code's logic is straightforward and secure.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. The assessment aligns with the code's features.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing proper session handling, cookie management, and HTML parsing. No suspicious or malicious code.\n\n- **Key points:** Use of optional Playwright, no hardcoded secrets, standard practices.\n\n- **Security implications:** No backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a legitimate Wilma API client, handling credentials, cookies, and message parsing securely. No malicious patterns.\n\n- **Key points:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard library usage, no suspicious network activity.\n\n- **Security implications:** No malware or sabotage detected.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Slightly lower risk due to the absence of notable anomalies.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no signs of malicious behavior. The code handles session cookies, HTTP requests, and HTML parsing in a standard, secure manner. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** None of the reports suggest obfuscation or hidden code. The code is straightforward and readable.\n\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero, reflecting the potential attack surface inherent in web scraping and session handling, but overall very low.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — minor, inherent risks in web scraping and session management, but no significant issues.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a well-implemented, standard API client for Wilma, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low risk score is justified, and no changes are necessary based on the provided reports.",
