  "purpose": "This code defines and exports data models for the Wilma API client, facilitating structured data handling within the client.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing models from wilma.models.messages",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths observed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected; the code is straightforward and standard for a models module",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes (Message, MessagesList, Sender) from an internal module and defines an explicit export list. There is no user input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. The structure and content are typical for a Python module exporting data models for an API client.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard models module for the Wilma API client with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
