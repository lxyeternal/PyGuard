  "purpose": "This code module imports specific message-related classes from wilma.models.messages and exposes them for external use, serving as a data model interface for the Wilma API client.",
  "sources": "Static import of classes from wilma.models.messages",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process or output external data",
  "flows": "Import statements to module exports via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static import and export with no dynamic or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static Python module importing classes Message, MessagesList, and Sender from wilma.models.messages and exposing them via __all__. It contains no dynamic execution, user input, network activity, or embedded secrets. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with standard practices for model modules. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence is high (1.0) given the simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module for exposing data models with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and the scores appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
