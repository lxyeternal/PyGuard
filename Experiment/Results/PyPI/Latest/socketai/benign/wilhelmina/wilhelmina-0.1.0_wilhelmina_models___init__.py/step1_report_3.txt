  "purpose": "This code defines model imports and exports for the Wilma API client, serving as a module for message-related data structures.",
  "sources": "Imports from wilma.models.messages: Message, MessagesList, Sender.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data processing or output are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to import and export of model classes without any data manipulation or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and only handles static imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from a local module and exposes them via __all__, serving as a module interface. It contains no data processing, user input handling, or network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The structure and content are typical for a model definition file in a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module for defining data models for an API client, with no malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
