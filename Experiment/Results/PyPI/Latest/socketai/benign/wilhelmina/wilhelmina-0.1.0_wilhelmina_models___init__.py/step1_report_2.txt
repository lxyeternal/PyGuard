  "purpose": "Defines public API models for Wilma API client by importing specific classes.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing Message, MessagesList, and Sender from wilma.models.messages",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; the code only defines imports and an export list",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs; simple import/export structure",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export of classes, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from a module and defines __all__ for exports. There are no input sources, no processing logic, no data flow or external dependencies beyond the import statement. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple module defining API models for export with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
