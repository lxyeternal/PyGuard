{
  "purpose": "This code provides a client for interacting with the Wilma API and manages installation of Playwright dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads input via function parameters, environment, and importlib.util.find_spec for module presence.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.run to execute system commands for installing dependencies, and logging for output.",
  "flows": "Checks for Playwright installation status, and if needed, executes 'pip install playwright' and 'playwright install chromium' commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The subprocess call to install dependencies is typical but could be exploited if inputs were untrusted, which is unlikely here.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages dependency installation for Playwright, checking for existing installations and conditionally executing 'pip install' commands. It uses standard Python modules and patterns without suspicious logic. No data leakage, credential handling, or malicious network activity is evident. The subprocess call could be exploited if user-controlled inputs influenced command parameters, but here it is static and safe. Overall, the code performs legitimate dependency management functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, focused on dependency management for Playwright, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It uses standard patterns, and no suspicious or malicious activities are detected.",
