{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and imports related to the Wilma API client, including a function to install Playwright dependencies automatically.",
  "sources": "Import statements, the 'install_playwright_deps' function, and the conditional auto-installation logic.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() call for installing dependencies, logging functions for output.",
  "flows": "User code may invoke 'install_playwright_deps', which may execute subprocess to install external dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The subprocess call is a standard way to install external dependencies. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors. The code only installs dependencies based on conditions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and Wilma client components. The 'install_playwright_deps' function checks for the presence of the 'playwright' package, logs information, and runs a subprocess to install browser dependencies if needed. The auto-install logic executes during import if 'playwright' is detected, which is a common pattern for optional dependencies. There is no evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system compromise mechanisms. The subprocess call uses the system Python executable and standard subprocess functions, with error handling, to install dependencies. Overall, the code appears to perform legitimate dependency management with no suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for managing Playwright dependencies in the Wilma API client. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is to ensure dependencies are installed, and it does so using standard, safe practices.",
