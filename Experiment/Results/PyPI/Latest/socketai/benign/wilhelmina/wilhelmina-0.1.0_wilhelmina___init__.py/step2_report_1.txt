  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their assessments, and determine the appropriate scores and conclusions.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Provides utility functions and imports for Wilma API client.\n- Contains a function `install_playwright_deps()` that checks for the presence of the `playwright` package.\n- If not present (or forced), it runs `subprocess.run()` to install the Chromium browser dependencies via `python -m playwright install chromium`.\n- During import, if `playwright` is detected, it auto-invokes the installation with `quiet=True`.\n- Uses standard modules, proper error handling, and logging.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Observations:\n- The subprocess call is standard for installing dependencies.\n- The code checks for the presence of `playwright` before attempting installation.\n- No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.\n- No hardcoded secrets or data leaks.\n- The auto-installation during import is a common pattern for optional dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a standard dependency installer, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, safe practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 (low, due to auto-install during import).\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis:** Appropriately notes the subprocess runs a controlled command, no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate dependency management, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the standard pattern, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to others, standard dependency management.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the safe, standard pattern, no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2), but all are low, reflecting minimal security risk due to auto-installation during import.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The code's purpose is legitimate: dependency management.\n- No evidence of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low risk due to auto-install during import, which is common but could be slightly unexpected in some contexts)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary. The code is a standard, safe utility for dependency management with minimal security risk.",
