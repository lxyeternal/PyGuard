  "purpose": "Provide a client for Wilma API with optional installation of Playwright dependencies.",
  "sources": "importlib.util.find_spec, subprocess.run, sys.executable, logger.warning, logger.info, logger.error",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run (executes package manager commands), logging outputs",
  "flows": "Checks if 'playwright' is installed -> logs warnings or info -> potentially runs subprocess to install dependencies -> logs success or failure",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The subprocess call is standard for dependency installation, and the import checks are typical.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages the installation of Playwright dependencies, checking for existing installation before attempting to install. Uses standard Python modules and logging. No external untrusted input is used for command execution; the subprocess call is parameterized safely with the current Python executable. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected. The automatic installation during import may be a concern if malicious actors modify package metadata or if the subprocess command is altered maliciously, but on its own, it appears standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for dependency management with no apparent malicious intent. The subprocess call is standard for installing dependencies, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
