  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Overall Code Summary:**\nThe code provides utility functions for managing the installation of Playwright dependencies within the Wilma API client. It checks if the 'playwright' package is installed, logs appropriate messages, and runs subprocess commands to install the browser dependencies if needed. The auto-installation logic runs during import if 'playwright' is detected, which is a common pattern for optional dependencies. The subprocess calls are standard, and there are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Findings:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. The subprocess call is a typical pattern for dependency installation.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified. The logic is straightforward and safe.\n- **Malware or malicious activity:** None detected. The subprocess executes a controlled command for dependency installation.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Hardcoded secrets or suspicious code:** None.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The subprocess command is static and safe, assuming the environment is trusted.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the individual reports:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Score:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.1, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.9\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly states the code is standard dependency management with no malicious activity. The low malware score (0) is appropriate.\n- **Reasonableness of scores:** The high overall risk score (0.9) seems slightly inflated given the benign nature, but since it's about the potential for dependency installation, it might reflect general caution. Still, a risk of 0.1 is more accurate.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable, but perhaps the overall risk could be lowered to 0.2.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Score:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly states the code is standard, with no malicious activity.\n- **Reasonableness:** The malware score of 0 is appropriate; the security risk could be slightly higher but still low.\n- **Conclusion:** The high risk score (0.9) seems overestimated; a lower value like 0.2-0.3 would be more fitting.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Score:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as legitimate dependency management.\n- **Reasonableness:** The high overall risk score (0.9) appears overestimated; the actual risk is minimal.\n- **Conclusion:** Slightly high; a risk score around 0.2-0.3 would be more appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Score:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Accurate, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Reasonableness:** The high risk score seems inflated; a lower score is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Adjusting overall risk to around 0.2-0.3 would better reflect the actual threat level.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Score:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.1, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Correct, no malicious activity.\n- **Reasonableness:** The risk score is likely overestimated; a value of 0.1-0.2 is more appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The malware score is correct; overall risk should be lowered.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly 0.\n- **Security risk & overall risk:** The scores of 0.9 seem overly high given the benign nature of the code. The core functionality is standard dependency installation, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n### **Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (reflecting low but non-zero risk due to dependency installation process)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard utility for dependency management with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The high risk scores assigned in the reports are likely overestimations. I recommend updating the overall risk score to around **0.2**, maintaining a malware score of **0**, and obfuscated remains **0**.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the benign nature of the code.",
