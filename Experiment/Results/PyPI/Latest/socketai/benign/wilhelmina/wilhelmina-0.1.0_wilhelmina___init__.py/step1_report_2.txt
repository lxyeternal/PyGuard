  "purpose": "This code provides a client for the Wilma API and includes a function to install Playwright dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'playwright' module presence, system environment via sys.executable, and logging outputs.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run command executes 'playwright install chromium', which could potentially execute arbitrary commands if manipulated, but in this context it runs a controlled command. Logging outputs could leak information if logs are improperly handled.",
  "flows": "The code checks for the presence of 'playwright', conditionally runs subprocess to install dependencies, and logs messages based on success or failure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or backdoors are present. The subprocess invocation is standard for dependency installation. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. The automatic installation during import is normal for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code securely checks for the presence of the 'playwright' module before attempting installation. The subprocess command uses the current Python executable to install browser dependencies, which is a common pattern. Error handling captures subprocess exceptions and logs errors. No malicious actions, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code does not execute untrusted code or contain obfuscated constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard dependency management routine for optional browser automation dependencies, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It operates within normal bounds for package setup and dependency installation.",
