  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core logic, potential security issues, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code's purpose is dependency management for Playwright within the Wilma API client.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated code are identified.\n- The subprocess calls are standard for installing dependencies.\n- The auto-installation during import is a common pattern for optional dependencies.\n- No hardcoded secrets or external inputs that could be exploited are present.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validity of Issues\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, all reports correctly identify that the code performs dependency installation via subprocess, with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Are there any errors or flaws?**  \n  No, the reasoning is consistent. The code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justifications\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  Slightly higher (0.1–0.2) in some reports, mainly due to the auto-installation during import and subprocess execution. While this is generally acceptable, auto-installing dependencies at import time can sometimes be a minor concern if malicious modifications occur, but on its own, it’s standard practice.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies or Concerns\n\n- The reports uniformly rate the security risk as low (around 0.1–0.2). This seems reasonable, given the code's behavior.\n- The subprocess call is well-encapsulated, with error handling.\n- No indication of untrusted inputs influencing subprocess commands.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and Recommendations\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Category            | Score |\n|---------------------|--------|\n| Malware             | 0      |\n| Obfuscated          | 0      |\n| Security Risk       | 0.1    |\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code performs a legitimate function—installing dependencies—using standard practices. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The auto-installation during import is typical for optional dependencies but could be slightly risky if the package is compromised, which is a general supply chain concern but not specific here.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Code is safe and legitimate.**  \n- **No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.**  \n- **Scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code’s behavior.**  \n- **Potential minor concern:** auto-installation during import, but this is common and not inherently malicious.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low scores for malware and obfuscated code. Keep the security risk minimal, but note that auto-installing dependencies during import can be a minor supply chain risk if the package is compromised.\n\n---\n\n**Work out the step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. Confirmed code performs dependency installation via subprocess, with no suspicious code.\n2. No backdoors, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n3. Scores are consistent and justified.\n4. The overall risk is low, but auto-installation could be flagged as a minor concern.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, and the current scores are appropriate.",
