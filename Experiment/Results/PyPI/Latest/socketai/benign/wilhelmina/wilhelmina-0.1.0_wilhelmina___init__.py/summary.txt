  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for dependency management with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The scores from the reports are consistent with this assessment. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to the auto-installation pattern which is common but could be a minor supply chain vector if the environment is compromised."
