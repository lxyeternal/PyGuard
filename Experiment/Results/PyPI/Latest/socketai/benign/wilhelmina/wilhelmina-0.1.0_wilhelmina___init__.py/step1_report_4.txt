{
  "purpose": "This code provides a client interface for the Wilma API and includes a function to install Playwright dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statements, environment variables (via importlib.util), and subprocess output during dependency installation.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run call executes a command to install Playwright dependencies, which could potentially be misused if the command were manipulated.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves checking if 'playwright' is installed, then potentially running 'python -m playwright install chromium' to set up dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or malicious backdoors are present. The subprocess call appears standard for dependency installation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines a function to install Playwright dependencies, including checks for existing installation and conditional auto-installation during import. The subprocess command runs the standard installation command for Playwright, capturing output based on quiet mode. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful commands. The subprocess execution is controlled and directly related to dependency management, which is typical for setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, focused on dependency management for the Wilma API client, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The subprocess call is standard and safely encapsulated, with no malicious signals detected.",
