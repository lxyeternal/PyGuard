  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for managing Playwright dependencies within the Wilma API client, including checking for existing installation and auto-installing dependencies if needed.",
  "sources": "Checks for 'playwright' module presence via importlib.util.find_spec; runs subprocess to execute 'python -m playwright install chromium'.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess call executes a controlled command; no untrusted data or external inputs influence subprocess execution.",
  "flows": "Checks module presence -> conditionally runs subprocess to install dependencies during import if 'playwright' is detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; standard dependency management logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard check for the 'playwright' package and installs Chromium dependencies via subprocess if not present or forced. During import, it auto-invokes installation if 'playwright' is detected, which is a common pattern for optional dependencies. The subprocess command is straightforward and includes error handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The subprocess call is controlled and safe, assuming the environment is trusted. The auto-install during import could be a minor supply chain concern if the package or environment is compromised, but no such evidence exists here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for dependency management with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The scores from the reports are consistent with this assessment. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to the auto-installation pattern which is common but could be a minor supply chain vector if the environment is compromised.",
