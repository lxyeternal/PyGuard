  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal placeholder or test package, containing only a docstring comment with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; absence of executable code prevents any source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple comment with no suspicious or unusual features.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a comment string 'Test package.' with no executable statements, data handling, or external interactions. All review reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the content. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate given the minimal content.",
