  "purpose": "Test configuration setup for pytest-based testing of WilmaClient interactions and message data mocking.",
  "sources": "pytest fixtures creating mock data and configuring test environment; importing modules and setting up mock requests.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data processing or external outputs that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Fixtures initialize mock data and override methods; mock requests simulate network calls; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is standard test setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of test fixtures to mock data and environment for testing WilmaClient. No user input, network data, or untrusted sources are directly processed in a way that could lead to security vulnerabilities. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. All mock data is static and controlled. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The code appears standard for testing purposes without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard testing setup with mock data and fixtures, showing no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not interact with untrusted sources beyond controlled mock data, and no dangerous behaviors are evident.",
