  "purpose": "Pytest configuration with fixtures for mocking WilmaClient interactions and test data.",
  "sources": "Fixtures creating mock message data, message content, and a mocked authenticated request method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data leaks; mock responses simulate network calls.",
  "flows": "Test fixtures provide static data; mocked request method returns successful responses without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets beyond test credentials, which are standard in testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test setup with mock data and network response simulation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The use of static mock data and mocked network responses indicates a benign testing environment. The only minor security consideration is the presence of hardcoded test credentials in fixtures, which is typical and acceptable for test code. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible, around 0.1, reflecting the minimal risk associated with test credentials.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard testing configuration with no indicators of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
