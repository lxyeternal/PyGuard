  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a standard unit testing suite using pytest and mocking techniques.\n- The tests verify the contents of `__all__` and the behavior of `install_playwright_deps` under various conditions.\n- The code mocks `importlib.util.find_spec` and `subprocess.run` to simulate different dependency states and command executions.\n- No untrusted data, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The subprocess calls are only mocked; no real system commands are executed.\n- The code does not exhibit signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Confirmations & Discrepancies:**\n\n- The code snippets do not contain any actual malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- The reports consistently assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The security risk scores are uniformly low or zero, which is appropriate given the controlled testing context.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n\n- The only point of note is the `securityRisk` score of 0.1 in report 4, possibly indicating a minimal concern about subprocess calls. However, since subprocess is mocked, this is not a real risk.\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are justified; all flows are within a testing environment with mocks.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, readable test code.\n- **Risk:** 0 — No real security risk, only standard testing practices.\n\n**Overall Estimation:**\n\nGiven the consistent evidence across all reports, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final Remarks:**\n\nThis code is legitimate unit testing code, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate in their assessments, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Score |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               |\n| Security Risk  | 0               |\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's safety and legitimacy.",
