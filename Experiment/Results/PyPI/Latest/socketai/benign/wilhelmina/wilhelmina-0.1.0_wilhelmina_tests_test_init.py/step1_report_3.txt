{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the __init__ module of the wilma package, specifically testing export contents and dependency installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports subprocess, pytest, and mocking functions; no external data sources; no input reading.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data leakage, external command execution beyond testing mocks, or insecure data handling.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke install_playwright_deps, which internally uses subprocess.run and importlib.util.find_spec; no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be standard unit test code with proper mocking; no suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual dynamic execution, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical unit testing tasks, mocking dependency checks and subprocess calls to verify behavior under different conditions. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated patterns are present. Use of subprocess.run is within a test context with mocked behavior, not executing external commands maliciously. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit testing script for the wilma package's dependency management functions. It contains no malicious behavior, no malware, and no security risks. It simply verifies functionality through mocking. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
