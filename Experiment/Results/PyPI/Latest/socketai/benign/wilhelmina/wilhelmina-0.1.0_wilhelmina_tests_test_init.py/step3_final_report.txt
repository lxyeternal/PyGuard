{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for the wilma package, verifying exported symbols and the behavior of install_playwright_deps under various dependency conditions.",
  "sources": "importlib.util.find_spec and subprocess.run (both mocked during tests)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are processed or executed outside mocks",
  "flows": "Mocked calls to find_spec and subprocess.run simulate dependency checks and command execution; no real data flows or system modifications occur",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; tests are straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite that mocks external dependencies to verify package exports and dependency installation logic. No malicious code, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The subprocess calls are only mocked, preventing real command execution. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate testing code with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate and reflect the safe, controlled testing environment.",
