{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the __init__ module of the wilma package, verifying exports and the behavior of the install_playwright_deps function.",
  "sources": "The code reads no untrusted input sources directly. It mocks internal functions such as importlib.util.find_spec and subprocess.run for testing purposes.",
  "sinks": "The code calls subprocess.run, which could execute system commands if untrusted data were passed. However, in this context, subprocess.run is mocked, preventing real execution.",
  "flows": "The test code flow involves mocking importlib.util.find_spec to simulate presence or absence of playwright, and mocking subprocess.run to simulate installation commands. The function install_playwright_deps is called, and its return value is checked.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets are present. Use of mocking and parametrize tests appears standard and appropriate. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily tests the presence of certain exports and the behavior of install_playwright_deps based on mocked conditions. No untrusted data sources, system command execution, or data leaks are involved. subprocess.run is mocked, so no risk of command injection or malicious command execution exists within this test suite.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test for a Python module with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any real system modifications or data handling beyond controlled testing. The use of mocking ensures safety and no malicious activity is present.",
