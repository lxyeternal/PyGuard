  "purpose": "Unit tests for the __init__.py module of the wilma package, specifically testing export contents and dependency installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading of __all__ list, import statements, and within test functions, mocking of importlib.util.find_spec and subprocess.run.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or dangerous commands are present.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke install_playwright_deps, which conditionally calls subprocess.run; no flow of untrusted data is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to follow standard testing practices. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test suite using pytest, mocking importlib and subprocess to verify behavior of dependency installation. No malicious patterns or security risks are evident. It does not execute untrusted data, nor does it perform any network or file system manipulations beyond mocking. The focus is on controlled test scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate unit testing code with no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is well-structured, with no suspicious behaviors detected.",
