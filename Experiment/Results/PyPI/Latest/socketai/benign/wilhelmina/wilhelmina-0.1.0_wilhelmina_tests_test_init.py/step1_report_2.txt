{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the '__init__' module of the 'wilma' package, specifically testing export contents and the installation of Playwright dependencies.",
  "sources": "import statements, mock setup, and test functions that simulate module behavior and subprocess calls",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run, importlib.util.find_spec, and any potential exception handling related to subprocess",
  "flows": "The test mocks find_spec to simulate the presence or absence of the Playwright package, and subprocess.run to simulate installation commands. These are used to verify the behavior of install_playwright_deps under different conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Use of standard mock and test patterns without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests using pytest and mock to validate the behavior of the 'install_playwright_deps' function in various scenarios. It properly mocks external dependencies like importlib and subprocess, avoiding actual system modifications. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code performs typical testing activities without any code injection, data leaks, or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard testing code for a Python package. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code solely focuses on validating package functionality through mocks, with no indication of sabotage or malware.",
