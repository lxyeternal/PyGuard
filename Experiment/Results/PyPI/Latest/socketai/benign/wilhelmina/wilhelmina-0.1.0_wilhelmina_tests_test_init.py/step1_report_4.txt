{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for the __all__ exports and the install_playwright_deps function within the wilma package.",
  "sources": "Reading __all__ for expected exports; invoking install_playwright_deps which internally calls importlib.util.find_spec and subprocess.run",
  "sinks": "Potential subprocess.run calls with dynamically executed commands (though command details are not shown), and importlib.util.find_spec for dependency checking",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke install_playwright_deps which checks for playwright presence using find_spec, then potentially runs subprocess commands based on conditions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. No malicious code or privacy violations detected. The subprocess calls are standard for dependency management, not malicious. The code appears to be standard testing code without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests for a Python package. It mocks dependency detection via importlib.util.find_spec and process execution via subprocess.run. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident, as all subprocess calls are typical for dependency installation or checking. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious flows. The functions tested are related to dependency management, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The code structure is clear and standard, with no obfuscated or unusual patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate testing code for dependency management within the wilma package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as intended for testing, with no suspicious activity.",
