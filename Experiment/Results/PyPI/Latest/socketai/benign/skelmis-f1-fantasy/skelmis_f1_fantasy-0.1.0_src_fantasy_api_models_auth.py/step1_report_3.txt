{
  "purpose": "Define data models for authentication and response data structures using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "Data inputs via instantiation of the Pydantic models with external data.",
  "sinks": "None; no direct data output or external system interactions present in this code.",
  "flows": "External data flows into model instantiation; no data flows to sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Pydantic's alias_generator for camelCase conversion; no suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several Pydantic data models for responses and authentication data, with proper structure and usage of alias generators. No input/output handling, network communication, or execution logic is present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The models are straightforward and standard for data validation, with no suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of Pydantic models for API response schemas. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
