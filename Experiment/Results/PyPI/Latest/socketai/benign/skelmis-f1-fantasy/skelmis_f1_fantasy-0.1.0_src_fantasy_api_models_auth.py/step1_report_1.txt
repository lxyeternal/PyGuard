  "purpose": "Define data models for authentication and response handling using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "Input data fields in Pydantic models, configuration for alias generation.",
  "targets": "No data sinks or external data interactions present; the code only defines data structures.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; models are used for data validation and serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of Pydantic data models with standard fields for authentication responses. It uses an alias generator for camelCase conversion, which is a common pattern. No external data sources, sinks, or malicious logic are present. The models appear straightforward, focusing on data validation and serialization, with no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of Pydantic models for handling authentication data. There are no indicators of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for data modeling purposes.",
