  "purpose": "Define data models for authentication and response data structures using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; data models rely on structured data passed during object instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; only model definitions with no side effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs (instantiation) into model instances; no untrusted data handling within models.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behavior detected. The use of alias generators is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple Pydantic models with clear data structures for authentication responses. The models utilize alias generators for JSON serialization. No external input reading, no data processing logic, no network calls, or data leaks are present. The code is purely data structure definitions with standard usage of Pydantic features. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a schema definition for authentication-related data and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard implementation of data models without security concerns.",
