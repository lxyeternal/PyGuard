  "purpose": "Define data models for authentication and response handling using Pydantic, facilitating JSON serialization with alias generators.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code reads static class definitions and fields.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data is processed or transmitted within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the models serve as schemas for data validation and serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of Pydantic models with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Pydantic data models with no logic, external interactions, or dynamic code execution. Use of alias generators is standard for JSON formatting. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The models are simple and serve as API response schemas. All signals indicate benign, standard code with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of Pydantic models for API responses. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified.",
