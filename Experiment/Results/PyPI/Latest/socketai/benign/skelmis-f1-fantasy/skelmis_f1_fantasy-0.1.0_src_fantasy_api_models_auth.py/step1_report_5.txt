  "purpose": "Defines Pydantic data models for authentication and response data serialization",
  "sources": "Hardcoded class attributes, imported functions, and type annotations",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or perform insecure operations",
  "flows": "Data from instantiation flows through model validation but no external input handling is shown",
  "anomalies": "Usage of alias generator functions (to_camel) is normal; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code defines several Pydantic models with clear purpose for data validation and serialization. It uses alias generators for JSON key formatting, which is a standard practice. No external input handling or insecure operations are visible. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The models simply structure data; there is no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks within this snippet. Overall, the code appears to be a typical schema definition without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of data models for authentication responses, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
