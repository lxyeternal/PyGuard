  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code only defines Pydantic data models for authentication responses.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or network operations are present.\n- Use of alias generators (to_camel) is standard and not suspicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are identified.\n- The code appears straightforward, serving as data schemas.\n\n**Specific issues:**\n- The only deviation is in report 5, which assigns a `securityRisk` score of 0.1, citing \"no hardcoded secrets\" but possibly implying some minimal concern. However, given the description, this seems unwarranted.\n\n**Malware scores:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Risk scores:**\n- All reports assign a risk score of 0 or very close to it, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Critical assessment:**\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n- The use of alias generators is a common pattern and not suspicious.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the reports correctly identify the code as standard data models.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable.\n- No changes are necessary; the analysis aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, standard implementation of data models with no security concerns.",
