  "purpose": "Define data models for API responses related to authentication and session management.",
  "sources": "Input data from API responses or external services populating the models.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks that process untrusted input directly; models are for structured data validation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external API responses into these models for validation and serialization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pydantic's alias generators like to_camel, but no suspicious or malicious code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several Pydantic models for structured data validation. It uses standard library imports and relies on external pydantic functions for alias generation. There are no indications of code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior. No unsafe operations, data leaks, or suspicious code patterns observed. The models appear to serve straightforward API data serialization/deserialization purposes. No obfuscated code, no suspicious data handling, and no external network operations or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data models for API responses with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears standard and safe, focused on data validation and serialization. No malware or malicious intent detected.",
