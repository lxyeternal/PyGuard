  "sinks": "No apparent sink for untrusted data or security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flows from sources to sinks that could cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. Use of __version__ and version_info is standard. The import of a local client module could be scrutinized if source is malicious, but cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up versioning information and configures logging with a NullHandler to avoid unwanted output. No malicious functions, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The import of a local module 'client' is common in package structure and does not indicate malicious intent by itself. The code is minimal and appears standard for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign and standard for a Python package initialization. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
