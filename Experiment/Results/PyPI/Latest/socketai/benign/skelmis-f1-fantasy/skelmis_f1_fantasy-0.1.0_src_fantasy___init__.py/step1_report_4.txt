  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a local module, sets version info as static data, and configures logging with a NullHandler. There are no dynamic or external inputs, no suspicious code, and no side effects beyond standard setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, serving as a basic setup module with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
