  "purpose": "Define data models for fantasy racing API, including driver and constructor details, session points, and additional statistics.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (typing, pydantic) and local modules (fantasy.api_models.encoder). Class definitions with no external input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or external data handling present; no untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from source to sink; the code solely declares data models without processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code is standard model declaration using pydantic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party libraries to define data models for a fantasy sports application. It includes class definitions with fields of various types, some optional. The code strictly models data without performing any I/O, network operations, or data manipulation. No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward, well-structured set of data models for a fantasy racing application. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious code behavior. It appears to be safe and intended solely for data validation and structure.",
