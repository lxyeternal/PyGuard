  "purpose": "Define data models for a fantasy racing API, representing session points, stats, driver/constructor items, and response structure.",
  "sources": "Imports of external libraries (pydantic, typing), class attribute definitions, type annotations, and nested class instances.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or handling evident in this code.",
  "flows": "N/A; this code is purely data model definitions without runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward data structure definitions. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries for data modeling and type annotations. It defines several classes using pydantic for data validation. Attributes are standard and include nested models, optional fields, and various data types. No dynamic execution, external calls, or data handling functions are present. The code appears to serve as schema definitions for an API related to racing fantasy data. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of data model definitions for an API, with no malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It appears to be well-structured, standard, and safe.",
