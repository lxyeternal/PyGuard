  "purpose": "Define data models for a fantasy sports API involving drivers and constructors, including session points and stats.",
  "sources": "Imports from pydantic, custom URL encoding class, and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted external input or data from untrusted sources within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data definitions provide structure; no data processing or external data flow mechanisms are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party libraries for data validation (pydantic). It defines data models with attributes to represent session points, stats, and driver/constructor info. All attribute types and structures appear consistent with data modeling practices. There is no code that executes untrusted inputs, performs network activity, or manipulates system resources. The code is straightforward, focused on data schemas, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code strictly defines data models for a fantasy sports application. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is a standard, well-structured schema definition with no suspicious elements.",
