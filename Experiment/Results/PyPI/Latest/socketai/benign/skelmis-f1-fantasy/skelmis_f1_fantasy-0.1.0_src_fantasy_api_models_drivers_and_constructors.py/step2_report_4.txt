  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is purely data models with no code execution, external calls, or malicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (possibly due to the use of pydantic, but that's standard).\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Same as Report 1; straightforward data models, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, standard data models with minimal risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. No malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, data schemas only, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—data models only, no code execution or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward data models.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, likely due to the use of pydantic or standard libraries, but these are not security risks.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports; no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0; code is clear, declarative, and standard.\n- **Risk:** Given the absence of any dynamic code, external data handling, or vulnerabilities, the risk score should be **0** for all reports.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No adjustments needed.",
