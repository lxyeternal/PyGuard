  "purpose": "Define data models for a fantasy racing API, including session points, statistics, and driver/constructor information.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard typing, pydantic, and internal modules; class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external data output is present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow; data models are static and used for data validation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed; code appears standard for data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple Pydantic models for data validation and structure, with no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no data leaks or malicious code. The use of type annotations and Pydantic for schema enforcement is standard. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks within the models. The only potential concern could be the usage of string types for fields that might contain sensitive info, but these are typical in such models and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data model setup for a fantasy sports application. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
