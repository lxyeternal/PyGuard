{
  "purpose": "Define data models for a fantasy racing application, representing session points, stats, and driver/constructor information.",
  "sources": "Import statements for future annotations, typing, pydantic models, and a URL-encoded string type; class attribute definitions including various data types.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No code writes data to external systems or network, nor executes untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the models are static data structures only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No obfuscated code, misleading variables, or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines data models using pydantic, which is a standard and safe practice for data validation. No functions or code execution logic are present that could be exploited or malicious. All imports are standard libraries or clearly referenced modules. No signs of malware or malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code, are evident. The structure appears to be straightforward schema definitions for data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative data modeling for a fantasy racing app and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
