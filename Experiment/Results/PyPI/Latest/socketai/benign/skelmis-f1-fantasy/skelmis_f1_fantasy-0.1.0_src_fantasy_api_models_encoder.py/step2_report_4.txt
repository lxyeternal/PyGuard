  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements a custom decoder class `MyEncoder` conforming to `EncoderProtocol`.\n- The `decode` method URL-decodes input bytes using `unquote`.\n- Defines a type alias `URLEncodedStr` as an `Annotated[str, EncodedStr(encoder=MyEncoder)]`.\n- The code is purely for data validation, with no external input/output, network activity, or side effects.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly implements a custom URL decoder as intended.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Data leaks or external effects:** None.\n- **Obfuscation or suspicious patterns:** None.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No evident vulnerabilities; the process is straightforward.\n\n### Review of each report:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and purpose-driven.\n- They correctly identify that the code performs URL decoding for validation purposes without side effects.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1.0), indicating strong agreement.\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low (0.1), as the code performs only decoding with no external interactions.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- Some reports assign a small security risk (0.1), possibly considering that if the decoded data is used insecurely elsewhere, risks could arise. But within this snippet, no such risks are evident.\n- The malware score should remain 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the code and reports, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minor concern if decoded data is misused downstream, but not in this code itself)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a benign utility for URL decoding within data validation schemas.\n- No evidence suggests any malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis supply chain component appears safe and purpose-specific. The minor security risk score is acceptable, given the context, but the malware score should remain at zero.",
