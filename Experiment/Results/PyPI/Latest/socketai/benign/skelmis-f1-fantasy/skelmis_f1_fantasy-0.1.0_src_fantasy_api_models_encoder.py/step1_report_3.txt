{
  "purpose": "Define a custom URL-decoding encoder for use with Pydantic's Annotated types.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines classes and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points; primarily type and encoder definitions.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code does not process untrusted data or perform data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward class implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'unquote' to URL-decode byte data. It defines 'MyEncoder' implementing 'EncoderProtocol', with a 'decode' method that decodes URL-encoded bytes. It then creates an annotated type 'URLEncodedStr' with the custom encoder. There are no input/output operations, no external data handling, and no dynamic execution or obfuscation present. The code appears to be a standard implementation of a custom URL decoder for Pydantic validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate custom URL decoder implementation intended for data validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in this snippet.",
