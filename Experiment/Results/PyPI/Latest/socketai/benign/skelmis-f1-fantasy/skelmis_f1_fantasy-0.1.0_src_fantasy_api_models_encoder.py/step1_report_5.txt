  "purpose": "Define a custom Pydantic encoder for URL-encoded strings that decodes data using urllib.parse.unquote.",
  "sources": "Data read via the decode method in MyEncoder, which receives byte data that is URL-encoded.",
  "sinks": "The decode method converts URL-encoded bytes to strings, but does not perform unsafe actions like network access or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input bytes are URL-decoded in the decode method; the resulting string is used as an EncodedStr type annotation.",
  "anomalies": "The code implements a custom decoder but does not perform any unusual or suspicious operations; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports unquote to URL-decode data, defines MyEncoder class implementing the EncoderProtocol with a decode method, which URL-decodes incoming byte data, and creates a type alias URLEncodedStr annotated with this custom encoder. There are no external data sources, network calls, or file manipulations. No anomalies or malicious behavior are detected. The code is straightforward and intended for data decoding within data validation schemas.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple implementation of a custom URL decoder for use with Pydantic models. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. Overall, it appears safe and purpose-driven for data decoding.",
