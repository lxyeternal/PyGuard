{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom URL decoding encoder for string validation using pydantic's EncodedStr and EncoderProtocol.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib.parse, pydantic, and typing_extensions; uses unquote() function on bytes input.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data output or external data transmission present.",
  "flows": "Data is decoded via unquote() within decode() method; no flow to external systems or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The decode method simply URL-decodes bytes input.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom encoder class MyEncoder that URL-decodes bytes data using urllib.parse.unquote() during decoding. This is used in an Annotated type alias for pydantic validation. The code performs straightforward URL decoding with no evident malicious behavior or side effects. There are no external network calls, no file operations, or hidden behaviors. The code is simple, using standard libraries, and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides a custom URL decoder for pydantic validation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign utility implementation.",
