{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for a fantasy sports API, representing player, team, user team, and response data structures.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from external API inputs and user inputs to populate data models.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network calls, database writes, or eval/exec are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external sources into the models during API data parsing and validation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The models are straightforward data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules (pydantic, typing). It defines several data models with various fields, mostly primitive types, and some optional fields. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or sensitive data handling is visible. The models are used for data validation and serialization in API responses. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The use of URLEncodedStr as a field type is a standard data type for URL-encoded strings, no suspicious behavior associated. All fields appear to serve the purpose of modeling game-related data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical set of data model definitions for a REST API, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It solely models data structures with no suspicious logic or external side-effects.",
