  "purpose": "Define data models for fantasy sports user and team information, likely used for API request/response validation.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input directly; it only defines data schemas using Pydantic models.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output handling present within this code.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code solely defines data structures without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious functions, no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of Pydantic model definitions used for data validation and serialization. All fields are explicitly typed, with optional fields and default values appropriately set. There are no external data reads, no sinks for untrusted data, nor any code that could execute dynamically or obfuscate logic. It appears to be standard data schema definitions for an API. No malicious or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as data models for API data validation without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
