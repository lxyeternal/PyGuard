{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for a fantasy sports API, serving as data schemas for user teams, players, and related information.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; only model field definitions and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data handling occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is declarative data schema without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Pydantic model definitions with no executable logic, external data interactions, or obfuscated constructs. The only imported custom type is 'URLEncodedStr', which likely handles validation but does not introduce vulnerabilities. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The models are used for data validation within an API context, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely declarative data schemas with no malicious or obfuscated content. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
