  "purpose": "Define data models for a fantasy sports application, representing user teams, players, and team info.",
  "sources": "Data input via the models, primarily from API requests or database fetches. No direct data input handling present.",
  "sinks": "None; models are for data validation and structure, not for processing untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data processing logic or untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of optional fields with default None, but no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines Pydantic models with typed fields, some with default values or optional annotations. No dynamic execution, code injection, environment variable access, or malicious patterns identified. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors observed. It appears to be a standard data modeling implementation for API data validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of data models with no malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and no security risks detected. It is a typical implementation for a backend API schema.",
