  "purpose": "Define data models for fantasy sports team and player information using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data sources; it defines data structures.",
  "writes": "None, the code only defines models and types.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling occurs within this code; it's purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed solely of class definitions using Pydantic for data validation and serialization. It imports type annotations and a custom type URLEncodedStr. There are no function calls, data processing, or external interactions that could be exploited. All attributes are standard data fields for modeling user teams, players, and related info, with optional and nullable fields clearly marked. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data models with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward data schema definition for a fantasy sports application, with no malicious intent or harmful constructs.",
