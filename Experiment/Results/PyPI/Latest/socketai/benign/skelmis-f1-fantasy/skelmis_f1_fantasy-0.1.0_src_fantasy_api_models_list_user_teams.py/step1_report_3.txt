  "purpose": "Define data models for user team management and fantasy sports application",
  "sources": "Input data for models: no direct external input reading; data fields initialized or assigned from external sources",
  "targets": "None explicitly; data models used for internal validation and processing",
  "flows": "No active data flow; structure suggests usage in API request/response handling",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior observed; the code consists solely of data model definitions with type hints",
  "analysis": "The code defines several Pydantic data models representing user and team information in a fantasy sports context. It imports standard typing and pydantic libraries, with no external input parsing or dynamic code execution. The only custom class imported is URLEncodedStr, which presumably sanitizes or encodes string data. The models are straightforward, containing various fields with types indicating data validation. There are no functions, network operations, or dynamic code evaluations present. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are evident. The models do not perform any actions, data processing, or contain any executable logic; they are purely structural.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of data models for a fantasy sports application, with no evidence of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of data schemas with no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
