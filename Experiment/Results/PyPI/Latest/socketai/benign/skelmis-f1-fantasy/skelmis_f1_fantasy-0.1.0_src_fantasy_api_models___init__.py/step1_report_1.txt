{
  "purpose": "The code imports various response classes from different modules within the same package, likely for use in an API or application to handle different data responses.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.homestats, .auth, .list_user_teams, .drivers_and_constructors, .user_game_days, .leagues)",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data or user input handling is visible in these import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable; these are static import statements without data processing or flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of import statements with well-structured module references.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports classes from local modules, indicating modular design. No dynamic code execution, data handling, or external input processing is present. The import statements appear standard for Python projects organizing API response schemas or data models. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security concerns in these statements.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet solely contains static import statements for organizing response classes within a package. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. The code appears legitimate and safe.",
