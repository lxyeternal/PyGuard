{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports various response classes from local files, likely for API response handling or data modeling in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading class definitions from local modules (homestats, auth, list_user_teams, drivers_and_constructors, user_game_days, leagues).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs; the code only imports classes without executing or passing data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; this code only imports classes, not runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are present in import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for class definitions from local modules. It does not process data, execute code, or perform network operations. The imported classes may handle sensitive data elsewhere, but this fragment itself is benign. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or malicious payloads. Since no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is visible, the risk is minimal. The structure is typical for organizing code into modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of import statements used to structure an application; there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues within this fragment. It appears safe and typical for a well-organized project.",
