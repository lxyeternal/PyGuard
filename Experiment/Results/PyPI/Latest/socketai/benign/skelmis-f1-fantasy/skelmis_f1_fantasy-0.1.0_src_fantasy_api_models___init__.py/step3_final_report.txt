{
  "purpose": "This code imports various response classes from local modules to organize API response handling within a Python project.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; purely structural imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow; import statements do not process data or execute code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements importing classes from local modules. There is no dynamic code execution, data handling, or external input processing. The code is well-structured and standard for a modular Python project. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The import statements are safe and do not pose security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of import statements with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
