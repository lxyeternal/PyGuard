{
  "purpose": "The code imports various response classes from local modules, likely to structure or handle API responses within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .homestats, .auth, .list_user_teams, .drivers_and_constructors, .user_game_days, .leagues.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data, no network or file I/O, no use of environment variables or external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, referencing classes from local modules. There are no functions, data processing, or external data handling present. The imports are standard and appear to be for structuring API responses. No code injection, no network communication, and no side effects are observable. This pattern suggests a typical modular design rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard module imports for organizing response classes. No anomalies, malware, or security threats are evident.",
