  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content:**\n   The code consists solely of static import statements importing various response classes from local modules within the same package. There are no functions, data processing, dynamic code execution, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Security and Malware Assessment:**\n   - **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation is present.\n   - **Malicious Behavior:** Import statements alone do not execute code or perform actions that could be malicious. There is no evidence of malicious payloads or behaviors.\n   - **Potential Vulnerabilities:** Since no data handling, user input, or external network interactions are present, the risk of vulnerabilities from this code snippet is negligible.\n   - **Data Flows & Sinks:** No data flows or sinks are observable here; these are purely structural imports.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - **Obfuscated:** 0\n     - **Malware:** 0\n     - **Security Risk:** 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n   - The confidence level is high (1), which is justified because the code is simple and unambiguous.\n\n4. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that these are standard import statements with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n   - They consistently conclude that the code is benign, well-structured, and typical for modular Python projects.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the classes imported are likely used elsewhere for handling API responses, the actual security implications depend on their implementations. However, based solely on this import snippet, there is no cause for concern.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are justified here, as import statements do not execute or process data.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessments are accurate.\n\n**Personal Risk Estimation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk evident)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code snippet is benign, well-structured, and poses no security threat. The import statements are standard practice in Python projects for organizing response models or data schemas. The scores reflect this accurately.",
