{
  "purpose": "The code imports various response classes from multiple modules within the package, likely to organize API responses for a larger application.",
  "sources": "The imports from local modules such as homestats, auth, list_user_teams, drivers_and_constructors, user_game_days, and leagues.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data processing or external data handling are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis can be performed from this code alone as it only contains import statements without further data processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs in these import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for various response classes, which are standard in modular Python projects. There is no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external network activity. The structure appears typical for organizing API response models and does not raise any security concerns or signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward module import setup for organizing response classes. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or security risks. It is standard boilerplate code for a structured project.",
