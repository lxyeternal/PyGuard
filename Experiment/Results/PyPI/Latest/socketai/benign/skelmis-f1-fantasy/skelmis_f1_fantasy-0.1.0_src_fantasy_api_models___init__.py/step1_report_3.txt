{
  "purpose": "The code imports various response classes from multiple modules, likely used to structure API responses in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules such as .homestats, .auth, .list_user_teams, .drivers_and_constructors, .user_game_days, and .leagues.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code only performs imports without processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are only import statements and no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard import syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several classes from local modules, which are likely used elsewhere in the application. It does not execute any code or handle data directly, so it presents no security concerns. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical set of import statements used to organize response data structures in an API client or server. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
