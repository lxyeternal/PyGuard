  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate client for the Formula 1 fantasy API, with no evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage. The primary security concern is the reliance on external token renewal endpoints, which could be exploited if malicious or insecure. Overall, the code is safe but should be reviewed for the security of external dependencies."
