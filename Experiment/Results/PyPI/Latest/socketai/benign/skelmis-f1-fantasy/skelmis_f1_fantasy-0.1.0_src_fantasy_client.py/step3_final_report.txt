{
  "purpose": "A Python API client for interacting with the Formula 1 fantasy platform, handling authentication, league data retrieval, user stats, and token renewal.",
  "sources": "User tokens stored in cookies and passed in request headers; API responses containing user and league data; external token renewal endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Tokens transmitted over HTTPS in JSON and cookies; external token renewal endpoints that send tokens as plain strings; API responses processed into data models.",
  "flows": "Tokens are obtained via authentication functions, stored, and used in subsequent API requests; token renewal functions send tokens to external URLs; data flows from API responses into data models.",
  "anomalies": "External token renewal endpoints with hardcoded URLs and static headers; unimplemented functions; external URLs with opaque query parameters; no obfuscation or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client with standard token handling, making API requests to fetch user and league data. The token renewal functions interact with external URLs, which could be suspicious if those endpoints are malicious or compromised. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are present. The code structure is clear, and no obfuscation is detected. The external endpoints and incomplete functions warrant caution but do not constitute malicious activity by themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate client for the Formula 1 fantasy API, with no evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage. The primary security concern is the reliance on external token renewal endpoints, which could be exploited if malicious or insecure. Overall, the code is safe but should be reviewed for the security of external dependencies.",
