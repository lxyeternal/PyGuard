  "purpose": "Define data models for a fantasy sports API using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, pydantic, and custom modules; class attribute declarations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or eval.",
  "flows": "N/A (data models only, no data flow logic).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs detected. Usage of URLEncodedStr and other custom types appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of Pydantic model definitions for API data structures related to fantasy sports. It imports standard typing hints and pydantic classes, as well as a custom URL-encoded string type. No user input handling, external data processing, or dynamic execution observed. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities identified. The models are straightforward, defining data shapes without logic or side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data models for an API, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It appears safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
