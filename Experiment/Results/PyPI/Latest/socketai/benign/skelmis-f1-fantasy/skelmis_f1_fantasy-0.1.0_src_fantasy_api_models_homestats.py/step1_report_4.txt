{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for a fantasy sports application using Pydantic, focusing on serialization and validation of team, race, and league data.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing', 'pydantic', and local modules for encoding and models.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no processing of untrusted input, no network or file I/O, no use of eval or exec.",
  "flows": "Data flows are primarily model definitions; no data processing logic, transformations, or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of URLEncodedStr type suggests input validation, but no hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling. The model definitions are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of class definitions for data validation using Pydantic, with no functions, data processing, or external interactions. All data fields are standard types or custom encodings for input validation. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscated segments. The code appears to be purely structural for data validation and serialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data model definitions for a fantasy sports app, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is well-structured and appears safe.",
