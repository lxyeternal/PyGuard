  "purpose": "Data models for a fantasy sports API, defining various entities such as drivers, teams, race results, and league summaries.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing', 'pydantic', and a custom type 'URLEncodedStr' from 'fantasy.api_models.encoder'. No external data input or dynamic sources present.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines data schemas without processing untrusted data or executing external commands.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data model definitions without data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual constructs detected. Use of 'URLEncodedStr' may imply input validation but is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Pydantic data models representing entities in a fantasy sports context. No dynamic code, external calls, or data processing is present. The models are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The use of custom types like 'URLEncodedStr' appears to be for input validation and does not indicate malicious intent. The minimal security risk score (around 0.1) reflects the static, schema-only nature of the code. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with no malware or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static, well-structured data models for a fantasy sports API, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the code poses no security threat.",
