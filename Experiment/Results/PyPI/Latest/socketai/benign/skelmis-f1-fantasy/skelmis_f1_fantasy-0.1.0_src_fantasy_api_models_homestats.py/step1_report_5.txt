  "purpose": "Define data models for a fantasy racing API, including team, driver, race, and league details.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input directly; it defines data structures with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions on external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the models are for data validation only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated features are present. The use of URLEncodedStr suggests data encoding but is not suspicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Pydantic model definitions for API data validation. There are no functions, data handling, or external calls. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or backdoors. The code's structure and syntax are straightforward and conformant with standard data modeling practices. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of data models for a fantasy racing application, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
