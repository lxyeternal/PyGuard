  "purpose": "Data models for a fantasy sports API, defining the structure of various entities such as drivers, teams, race results, and league summaries.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and imported modules (pydantic, fantasy.api_models.encoder). No external input sources are directly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs involved in the code; the code primarily defines data schemas without executing any logic or I/O operations.",
  "flows": "The code defines data flow structures but does not contain executable flows or data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. The code uses standard data modeling patterns with no obfuscated or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple Pydantic models for data validation and serialization in a fantasy sports context. It imports standard and custom modules but does not perform any data processing, I/O, or code execution. All models are straightforward, with no dynamic code, no external calls, and no potentially malicious constructs. The structure adheres to typical data modeling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of data models with no signs of malicious behavior, no data leakage, and no security risks. It appears to be a standard implementation for defining API data structures. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
