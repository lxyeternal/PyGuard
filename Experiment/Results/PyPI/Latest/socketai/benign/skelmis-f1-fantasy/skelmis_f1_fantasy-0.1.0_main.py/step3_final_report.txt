  "purpose": "Asynchronous login using credentials retrieved from environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'username' and 'password' accessed via os.environ[]",
  "sinks": "Client.login() method which uses the provided credentials",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> os.environ[] -> Client.login()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward credential retrieval and login process",
  "analysis": "The code imports asyncio and os, then defines an async main() that logs in with credentials from environment variables. It runs main() via asyncio.run(). No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of environment variables is standard but relies on external environment security. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. External package 'fantasy.Client' cannot be assessed but usage appears typical. The code is simple, clear, and aligns with common practices for credential-based login.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a straightforward asynchronous login with credentials from environment variables. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is detected. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and justified.",
