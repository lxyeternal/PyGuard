  "purpose": "Data models for fantasy racing game API responses and user data management",
  "sources": "Imported modules: __future__, typing, pydantic, and custom encoder. Data fields within classes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or external data handling; no I/O, database, or network calls present.",
  "flows": "Data is stored and accessed via class properties and attributes; no flow to untrusted sources or sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Usage of properties appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models using Pydantic for structured validation and serialization. No code execution, network calls, or insecure data handling identified. All data fields are straightforward and type-annotated. No suspicious logic, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code focuses on data structure representation with no apparent attack vectors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of structured data models for a fantasy sports API, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It is safe and standard for such applications.",
