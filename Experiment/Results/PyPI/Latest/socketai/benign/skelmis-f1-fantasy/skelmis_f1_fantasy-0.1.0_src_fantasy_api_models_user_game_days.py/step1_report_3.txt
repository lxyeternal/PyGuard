{
  "purpose": "Data modeling for a fantasy racing application, representing user teams, race points, and user stats.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources for untrusted input; data appears to be received from external API responses or user input through model instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No dangerous sinks such as network calls, file operations, or execution of untrusted data are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input (possibly API) into models; no untrusted data is processed into security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors, such as obfuscated logic, dynamic code execution, or hardcoded credentials, are present. Property methods are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of data model definitions using Pydantic. It defines several data structures for user teams, race points, and overall standings. No external data sources are directly invoked within this code, and no operations like network requests, file handling, or command execution are present. All fields are typical for data models. The code does not include any malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It uses standard Python type hints, Pydantic features, and data encapsulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for data representation with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any signs of malware or malicious behaviors. It is safe for use in the context of a larger application.",
