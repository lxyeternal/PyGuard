  "purpose": "Data models for a fantasy racing application, representing user and team statistics, race points, and related information.",
  "sources": "Code imports (pydantic, typing), class attributes, property methods, and data fields within models.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly handles untrusted input or external data sources within this snippet; it mainly defines data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows are internal within the data models, with no external data processing or transmission shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments detected. No obfuscated code present. The models are straightforward and follow standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data models using pydantic for serialization/deserialization of JSON data. There are no input handling, data validation beyond pydantic's defaults, or external calls. The models include typical attributes for a fantasy racing app, with some properties like 'points' and 'points_per_race'. No suspicious patterns, code injections, or malicious behavior are evident. The usage of types and properties aligns with standard data encapsulation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard set of data models for a fantasy racing application, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines structured data containers without processing untrusted external data or executing code beyond data modeling.",
