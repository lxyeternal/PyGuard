{
  "purpose": "Define data models for a fantasy racing application's API, including user team details, race points, and user responses.",
  "sources": "Data is primarily read from JSON input via Pydantic models. No external data sources or input mechanisms are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data output, system calls, or network connections are present; the code only defines data structures.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows from sources to sinks within the code, only data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are observed. Use of type annotations, Pydantic models, and property decorators are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of several Pydantic data models used for serializing/deserializing JSON data related to a fantasy sports application. No external input handling, no network operations, no code execution, or malicious logic are present. The models are straightforward, with standard usage of type hints and properties. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected. All models define data containers with no side effects or active operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data model definitions for a fantasy racing application, with no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security risks detected. It appears safe and standard for defining data structures.",
