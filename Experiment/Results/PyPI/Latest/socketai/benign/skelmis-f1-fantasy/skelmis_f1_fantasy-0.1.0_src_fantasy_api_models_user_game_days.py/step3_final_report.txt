{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for a fantasy racing application's API responses and user data, with no active behavior or external data handling.",
  "sources": "Reading data from attributes such as 'webpurifyresponse', 'userhome', 'mddetails', etc.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data stored in 'webpurifyresponse' and 'mddetails' (if processed elsewhere), but no processing occurs here.",
  "flows": "Data is assigned to model attributes; no external data flows or code execution observed.",
  "anomalies": "The 'webpurifyresponse' field may contain untrusted data; no validation or sanitization shown.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Pydantic data models with straightforward attribute definitions. No code execution, network calls, or malicious logic are present. The only potential concern is the 'webpurifyresponse' string, which could hold untrusted data, but it is only stored without processing. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code. The security risk score is minimal (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting the potential for untrusted data storage but no active exploitation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, standard data models with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The slight concern about untrusted data in 'webpurifyresponse' is acknowledged but does not constitute an active threat. Overall, the code appears secure and well-structured.",
