  "purpose": "The code converts Bluesky profile post URLs into ATProto URIs by resolving user handles to DIDs.",
  "sources": "Reads input URL from function arguments and network request to resolve handles via requests.get()",
  "sinks": "Potentially the network request in _resolve_did() that could send data externally, but no data is leaked or misused.",
  "flows": "Input URL is parsed; handle is extracted and resolved via network request; the DID is combined with post ID to produce a URI.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Uses standard libraries; no obfuscated code or unusual patterns. Logging is appropriately used for debugging.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly performs URL pattern matching, handle resolution through an external API call, and string construction. The network request is the only external data flow, which is standard for handle resolution. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code is present. The URL pattern matching and handle resolution are straightforward. Logging is used for debugging purposes. The code relies on an external API which could be a privacy concern if misused, but this does not constitute malicious intent within this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical URL converter with handle resolution via a public API. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or suspicious anomalies. No security risks are identified beyond normal API usage, and the code appears safe.",
