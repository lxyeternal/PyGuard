  "purpose": "Convert Bluesky URLs to ATProto URIs by resolving handles via an external API and constructing the appropriate URI.",
  "sources": "Reads input URL, extracts handle and post ID, and makes an HTTP GET request to resolve the handle.",
  "sinks": "External API call for handle resolution; no direct sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "URL pattern matching → handle extraction → API request to resolve handle → URI construction.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward pattern matching and API call. External API usage could raise privacy considerations but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs URL validation with regex, resolves a handle via a standard API, and constructs a URI. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The API call is a typical pattern for handle resolution, with no signs of malicious activity. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to privacy concerns of external API use, but no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, transparent utility for URL conversion with handle resolution. It contains no malware or obfuscation, and the security risk is very low. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the analysis and do not require adjustment.",
