  "purpose": "Convert Bluesky URLs to ATProto URIs by resolving handles to DIDs and constructing URIs.",
  "sources": "Reads input URL string from function parameters, and fetches data via HTTP requests to the Bluesky API.",
  "sinks": "Uses the HTTP response data (DID) to construct and return a URI; logs errors.",
  "flows": "Input URL -> regex match -> handle extraction -> HTTP request to resolve DID -> URI construction",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code. No suspicious dynamic execution or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs URL pattern matching, handle resolution via an external API, and URI construction. It employs standard libraries and HTTP requests, with no embedded or hidden malicious logic. The external request to resolve handle might be a privacy concern but does not constitute malicious activity. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The logging is safe and used for debugging. No code injection, data leakage, or backdoors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a URL converter with handle resolution via an external API. No malicious intent, backdoors, or malware indicators are present. It appears to be a standard utility script with safe operations.",
