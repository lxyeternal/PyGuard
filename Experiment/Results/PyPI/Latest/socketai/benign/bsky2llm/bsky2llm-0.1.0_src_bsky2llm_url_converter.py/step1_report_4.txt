  "purpose": "Convert Bluesky URLs to ATProto URIs by resolving user handles to DIDs and constructing the URI",
  "sources": "Reads input URL, reads handle from URL, calls external API to resolve handle",
  "sinks": "Requests to external API, logging functions, string construction for URIs",
  "flows": "Input URL -> URL pattern matching -> handle extraction -> API request to resolve handle -> construct URI",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious API endpoints, no obfuscated code, standard use of requests library",
  "analysis": "The script processes user input URLs, matches URL patterns, and makes HTTP GET requests to an external API for handle resolution. It then constructs a URI from the DID. The external API endpoint is public and used for handle resolution. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. Logging is used for debugging and errors, which is standard practice. No code injection, data leaks, or unsafe operations are present. The code does not perform any network operations beyond legitimate API calls and does not handle sensitive data beyond the URL and handle inputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard URL-to-URI converter utilizing an external public API to resolve handles. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. It follows good practices and uses common libraries appropriately. No security risks are evident in this code segment.",
