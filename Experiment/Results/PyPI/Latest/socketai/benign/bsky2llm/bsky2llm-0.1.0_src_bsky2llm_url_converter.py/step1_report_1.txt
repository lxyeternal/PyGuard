  "purpose": "Convert Bluesky URLs to ATProto URIs by resolving handles to DIDs and constructing the appropriate URI format.",
  "sources": "Reads input URLs from the convert_url_to_uri function; fetches data via HTTP requests to external API for handle resolution.",
  "sinks": "Requests made to external API endpoint for handle resolution; potential data leakage if handle data is sensitive, but no data is sent unencrypted or maliciously.",
  "flows": "Input URL -> regex matching -> handle extraction -> external API request -> response handling -> URI construction.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external API without input validation beyond regex; no hardcoded credentials; no obfuscated code; standard usage of requests library. No unusual or malicious code behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code performs URL pattern matching, handle resolution through an external API, and URI construction. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is present. External requests are standard for handle resolution. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are detected. The code appears to serve its stated purpose securely and transparently.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward URL to URI converter with handle resolution via external API. It contains no malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It uses standard libraries appropriately and does not include obfuscated or malicious code. The security risk is minimal.",
