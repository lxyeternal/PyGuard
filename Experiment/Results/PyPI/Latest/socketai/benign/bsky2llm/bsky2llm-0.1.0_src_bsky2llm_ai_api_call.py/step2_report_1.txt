  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard implementation for interacting with OpenAI and Azure OpenAI APIs. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected. The environment variables are used for credentials, which is typical. The overall security risk is low.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2  \n  The risk score is slightly above zero, reflecting a minimal concern due to reliance on environment variables, but this is standard practice.\n\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malware or malicious intent. The low risk score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the safe handling of credentials, standard API usage, and lack of suspicious behaviors. The confidence is high (0.95).\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The zero risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is a straightforward API client with proper credential management and no signs of malicious activity. Slightly higher risk score (0.1) possibly due to the handling of sensitive info in logs, but still minimal.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, and the score appears reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports. No suspicious code, no backdoors, no obfuscation. The code is a standard API wrapper.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n- **Justification:** Appropriate low risk score, no malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: legitimate API client, no malicious activity, proper credential handling.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n\n- **Justification:** No concerns, zero risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior—no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward and readable.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are reasonable, reflecting minimal concern over environment variable handling, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1–0.2** — Slight concern over environment variable reliance, but standard practice.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (considering environment variables are standard but require secure management)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the scores appropriately reflect the code's benign nature. No further escalation or concern is warranted based on the provided analysis.",
