  "purpose": "A Python module to interact with Azure OpenAI and OpenAI APIs, sending messages and receiving responses.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for API keys and endpoints; JSON message file loaded from disk.",
  "sinks": "API calls to external services; response returned as plain text; optional file write.",
  "flows": "Loading credentials from environment variables -> initializing API clients -> sending message data to API -> receiving response -> returning or saving response.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client for OpenAI and Azure OpenAI, with standard credential management, error handling, and logging. No malicious or suspicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The environment variables are used appropriately for credentials, and the API calls follow expected patterns. No data leaks or network anomalies are evident. The code's structure and logic are clear and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the analysis. It is a standard, secure implementation for API interaction.",
