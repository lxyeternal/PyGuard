  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for converting Bluesky posts into formats suitable for Large Language Models, by importing various processing modules and exposing main functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing functions from local modules (.url_converter, .get_raw_thread, .process, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data directly are present in this fragment; it mainly imports functions and sets a version.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is present in this code snippet; it merely imports functions and sets a version.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initialization file that imports multiple functions from local modules and sets a version. It serves as an interface or entry point for the package, with no data processing, external network calls, or handling of untrusted input shown here. There are no signs of malicious intent, code injection, or hidden behaviors. It appears to be standard and well-structured for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initializer that imports functions and sets a version number. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe based on this fragment.",
