  "purpose": "To provide tools for fetching, processing, and converting Bluesky posts into formats suitable for Large Language Models.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules such as url_converter, get_raw_thread, process, markdown_creator, process_video, process_image, md_to_openai, and ai_api_call.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external data leaks are present; functions are imported and assigned to variables without execution.",
  "flows": "No data flows are explicitly depicted in this code; it only imports functions and sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for a package's __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as an initializer or entry point for the package, importing various functions for external use and defining a version. All imports are from local modules, with no execution of dynamic code or inclusion of external untrusted data. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious logic are evident. The code structure and content align with typical Python package design.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer with no malicious or suspicious components detected. It simply sets up imports and versioning, with no security risks identified.",
