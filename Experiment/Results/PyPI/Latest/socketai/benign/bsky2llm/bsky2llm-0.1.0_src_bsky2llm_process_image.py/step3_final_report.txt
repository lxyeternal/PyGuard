  "purpose": "Process image content from Bluesky posts, including handle resolution, image detection, downloading, and markdown generation.",
  "sources": "Requests to external APIs for handle resolution and CDN URLs for images; reading post data; writing images to disk.",
  "sinks": "Downloading images from external URLs; saving images locally; generating markdown referencing local files.",
  "flows": "Handle resolution request -> image URL retrieval -> image download -> save to disk -> markdown creation referencing local images.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. External requests are to known endpoints. No backdoors or malicious payloads present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations for social media image processing: resolving handles via known API, detecting images in post data, downloading images with content-type verification, and generating markdown. It uses straightforward logic, with no obfuscation or malicious behavior. External requests are to reputable endpoints, and file operations are handled securely. No suspicious patterns, data exfiltration, or sabotage mechanisms are present. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there is no malicious intent. The obfuscation score is 0, given the code clarity. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), justified by network interactions but no active threats or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs its intended function without malicious intent or obfuscation. External API calls are legitimate, and no security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
