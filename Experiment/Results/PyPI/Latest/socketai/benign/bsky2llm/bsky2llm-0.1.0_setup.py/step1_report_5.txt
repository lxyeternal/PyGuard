{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for a Python module named 'bsky2llm', including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Code reads fixed strings for requirements and long_description; imports from setuptools and os; no input or external data sources used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; static configuration without user input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The code uses standard setup procedures with explicit dependencies and metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup routine for packaging a Python project. It defines dependencies explicitly, provides project metadata, and specifies package directories. No code executes external commands, network operations, or manipulates untrusted data. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or hidden backdoors are present. The code structure and content are typical for Python packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It follows standard practices for defining package requirements and metadata. There are no suspicious behaviors or security concerns.",
