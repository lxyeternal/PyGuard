  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python module named 'bsky2llm'. It defines requirements, description, and metadata statically, with no dynamic or external data handling.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of requirements, description, and metadata within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network, file, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely configuration without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, static, and follows typical packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup script with hardcoded data, importing only standard modules. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's purpose is solely to configure package installation, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
