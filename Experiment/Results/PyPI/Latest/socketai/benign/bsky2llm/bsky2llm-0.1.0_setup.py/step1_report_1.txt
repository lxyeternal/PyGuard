{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python module named 'bsky2llm' for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "The script reads static data for requirements, description, and package configuration; no external input or user data is read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: static data is passed to the setup() function for package configuration; no data from untrusted sources flows into critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard setup procedures; all data is hardcoded or static.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities, defines package requirements and description directly, and calls setup() with static parameters. There are no dynamic inputs, no external data reads, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious patterns. It appears to be a typical Python packaging script with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module. It contains no malicious behavior, malicious payloads, or security risks. The code is straightforward and safe.",
