{
  "purpose": "Process and transcribe video content from Bluesky posts, including downloading videos, extracting frames and audio, and generating markdown output.",
  "sources": "Handles user input via post_data dictionary, reads environment variables for API keys, fetches data from external URLs, reads and writes files, and captures environment variables for API credentials.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, file writes for video, audio, and frame data, subprocess calls for ffmpeg, and API calls to OpenAI and AzureOpenAI for transcription.",
  "flows": "Extracts video URLs from post_data (source), downloads videos or blobs (sink), extracts audio (sink), transcribes audio via API (sink), extracts frames at specific timestamps (sink), and generates markdown (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials found; environment variables are used for API keys. Downloading videos from public URLs is standard. No hidden or obfuscated code detected. External API calls are expected for functionality, not suspicious. No malicious code or backdoors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code responsibly manages environment variables for API credentials, uses standard libraries for HTTP requests, subprocess execution, and media processing. It attempts multiple methods for downloading HLS streams, falling back appropriately. The audio transcription leverages OpenAI and Azure APIs with proper error handling. File operations and API calls follow expected patterns. No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. All external interactions are standard for media processing workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs legitimate media processing tasks with appropriate API usage and environment variable management. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are evident. The code appears secure and well-structured for its intended purpose.",
