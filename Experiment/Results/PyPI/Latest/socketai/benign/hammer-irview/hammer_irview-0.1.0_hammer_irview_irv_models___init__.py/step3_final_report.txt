  "purpose": "Assess supply chain security of the open source dependency based on provided code analysis reports.",
  "sources": "No actual code provided; assessments are based on high-level summaries and descriptions.",
  "sinks": "No specific untrusted data sources identified due to absence of code; analysis relies on reported patterns.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no code to trace data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected; reports indicate no malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack concrete code snippets, relying solely on summaries. Malware scores are consistently 0, indicating no evidence of malicious intent. Obfuscation scores are 0, aligning with the absence of obfuscation indicators. Security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting cautious but reasonable assessments given the limited information. Confidence levels vary from 0.6 to 0.8, slightly optimistic considering the lack of actual code. Overall, the evaluations are conservative and aligned with the evidence, with no significant anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided summaries, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate. Slightly lowering confidence in some reports could be considered, but overall, the assessments are consistent and reasonable given the limited data.",
