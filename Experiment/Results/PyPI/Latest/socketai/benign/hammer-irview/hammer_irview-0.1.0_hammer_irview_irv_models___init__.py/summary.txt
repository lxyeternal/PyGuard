  "conclusion": "Based on the provided summaries, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate. Slightly lowering confidence in some reports could be considered, but overall, the assessments are consistent and reasonable given the limited data."
