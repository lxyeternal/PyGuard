  "purpose": "Create a Qt application for VLSI driver visualization with signal handling and threading.",
  "sources": "Reading signal from the OS (signal.signal), thread start (Thread), loading data via main.load_hammer_data.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks such as network, file write, or command execution.",
  "flows": "Signal handler calls QApplication.quit(); thread runs main.load_hammer_data(driver).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Use of signal handling and threading appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Qt application class with a signal handler for SIGINT to allow graceful shutdown. It starts a background thread to load data using the provided driver. No suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The use of threading and signal handling is standard for GUI apps. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical PyQt application setup with proper signal handling and threading. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage within this code fragment.",
