  "purpose": "Create a Qt application for VLSI design visualization using Hammer driver and IRVMainWindow.",
  "sources": "Imports signal, threading.Thread, PySide6.QtWidgets.QApplication, and custom modules (hammer.hammer.vlsi.driver, hammer_irview.irv.mainwindow).",
  "sinks": "signal.signal sets signal handlers; Thread starts load_hammer_data method with driver argument; QApplication.quit called on SIGINT.",
  "flows": "SIGINT signal triggers handle_sigint, which calls QApplication.quit. The thread runs load_hammer_data with driver, potentially processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Use of threading and signal handling is standard. No unusual or obfuscated code features.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a GUI application with signal handling for graceful shutdown upon SIGINT. It spawns a thread to load data via driver.load_hammer_data, which is expected behavior for a data-loading process. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or backdoors. The code appears to be a typical pattern for a GUI app integrating with an external driver, with proper signal handling for clean exit.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard application setup for a GUI with threading and signal handling. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. It functions as an interface to load data and handle SIGINT gracefully.",
