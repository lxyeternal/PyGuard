{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Qt application with a main window for visualizing data related to HammerDriver and sets up a signal handler for graceful shutdown.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data indirectly through the load_hammer_data method of the main window, which is triggered in a separate thread.",
  "sinks": "The code invokes QApplication.quit() upon SIGINT, which terminates the application. No direct sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Signal SIGINT (source) triggers handle_sigint, which calls QApplication.quit(), leading to application shutdown.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not perform any suspicious operations like network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution beyond normal app control. The threading and signal handling are standard. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom QApplication subclass, IRVApp, which initializes a main window and sets up a signal handler for SIGINT. When SIGINT is received, it logs a message and quits the application gracefully. The load_hammer_data method is called in a separate thread to load data asynchronously. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The use of threading and signal handling appears standard for GUI applications. No external data sources or sinks with untrusted input are used in a suspicious manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard GUI application setup for visualizing data with proper handling of termination signals. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. The overall security risk is low.",
