  "purpose": "Initialize a PySide6 QApplication, set up a main window, and handle SIGINT signals to exit gracefully while loading data via a driver.",
  "sources": "Signal handling for SIGINT, loading data with self.main.load_hammer_data(driver)",
  "sinks": "Signal handler calling QApplication.quit(), thread executing load_hammer_data(driver)",
  "flows": "SIGINT signal triggers handle_sigint, which calls QApplication.quit(); thread runs load_hammer_data with driver",
  "anomalies": "Use of signal handling within a GUI application; no validation or sanitization of driver input; no suspicious code execution observed",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a QApplication with a main window, registers a signal handler for SIGINT to exit gracefully, and starts a thread to load data using the provided driver. The signal handling and threading are standard for GUI applications. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code appears to be straightforward application logic with proper signal handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical GUI application setup with safe signal handling and multithreading for data loading. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
