  "purpose": "Set up a GUI application with signal handling and data loading in a separate thread.",
  "sources": "signal.signal() for SIGINT, self.main.load_hammer_data(driver) in a thread",
  "sinks": "QApplication.quit() called in signal handler",
  "flows": "SIGINT signal -> handle_sigint -> QApplication.quit()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious external activity",
  "analysis": "The code defines a GUI application subclass that initializes a main window, sets up a SIGINT handler to gracefully exit, and loads data asynchronously via threading. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. Signal handling and threading are used in standard ways, and no external network activity or data exfiltration is present. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical GUI app practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured GUI application with proper signal handling and data loading mechanisms. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified.",
