  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines a subclass of QApplication (IRVApp).\n- Sets up a main window (`MainWindow()`).\n- Registers a SIGINT handler (`handle_sigint`) that logs and calls `QApplication.quit()`.\n- Starts a thread to load data (`self.main.load_hammer_data(driver)`).\n- Uses standard signal handling and threading patterns.\n- No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation observed.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the described purpose: GUI setup, signal handling, data loading via driver.\n- No anomalies like code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious external calls.\n- No obfuscation or malicious patterns evident.\n- Use of threading and signal handling appears standard.\n\n### Issue presence:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security flaws.\n- The threading and signal handling are implemented correctly and safely.\n- No validation or sanitization of the driver input is performed, but given the context, this is typical and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (0.1 to 0.2), which seems reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- The code is standard application logic with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports assume no malicious behavior based on static code analysis, which is reasonable here.\n- No external network activity or data exfiltration is indicated or suspected.\n- The use of signal handling in a GUI app is standard; no unusual patterns are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard GUI app with proper signal handling)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code appears to be a typical, well-structured GUI application for VLSI visualization.\n- No signs of supply chain compromise or malicious code.\n- The threading and signal handling are correctly implemented.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, I concur with the assessments that there is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a safe, standard application with no evident security concerns.",
