  "purpose": "Initialize a Qt application with a main window and handle SIGINT for graceful shutdown, using a provided HammerDriver instance.",
  "sources": "signal.signal() for SIGINT, Thread(target=self.main.load_hammer_data) with driver as argument",
  "sinks": "QApplication.quit() called on SIGINT, thread executing load_hammer_data method",
  "flows": "SIGINT signal -> handle_sigint -> QApplication.quit; Thread running load_hammer_data(driver)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; proper use of signal handling and threading; no suspicious external network calls or data leaks observed",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a QApplication subclass that initializes a main window. It defines a signal handler for SIGINT to terminate gracefully. The handler logs an info message and quits the application. The load_hammer_data method is called asynchronously in a separate thread with a driver object. No malicious or suspicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious network activity, is evident. The use of threading and signal handling appears standard and appropriate. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical application setup with signal handling and threading. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation appears safe and well-structured.",
