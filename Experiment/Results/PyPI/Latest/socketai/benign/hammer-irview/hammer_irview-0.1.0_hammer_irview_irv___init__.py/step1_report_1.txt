  "purpose": "This code imports components 'IRVApp' and 'MainWindow' from local modules, likely for a GUI application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.app and .mainwindow).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are evident; just imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from relative modules, which is typical for modular Python projects. No input handling, data processing, or potentially malicious functions are present. There are no signs of obfuscation, external network activity, or malicious behavior. The structure appears standard for a GUI app based on these components.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, consisting only of import statements with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
