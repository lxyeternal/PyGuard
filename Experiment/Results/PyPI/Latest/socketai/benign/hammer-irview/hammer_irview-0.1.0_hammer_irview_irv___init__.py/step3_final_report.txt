  "purpose": "Import classes IRVApp and MainWindow from local modules for application setup.",
  "sources": "Relative import statements from .app and .mainwindow modules",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; purely static import statements",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules; no data flow or execution beyond module loading",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for Python projects",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements importing classes from local modules. There are no inputs, outputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is syntactically correct, not obfuscated, and contains no suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with high confidence, and assign malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and standard structure justify these assessments. No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, standard import statement segment of a Python GUI application, posing no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
