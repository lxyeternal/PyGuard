  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data handling or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules. There are no data inputs, no dynamic execution, or external network interactions. No suspicious behavior, obfuscated code, or potential malicious activity is evident. The structure is typical for Python projects using relative imports to organize code components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a typical part of a larger application structure.",
