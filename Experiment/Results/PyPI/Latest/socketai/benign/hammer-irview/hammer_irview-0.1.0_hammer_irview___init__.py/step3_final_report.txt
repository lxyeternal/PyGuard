  "purpose": "A graphical intermediate representation viewer for chip floorplanning.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, driver object passed to functions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration points",
  "flows": "Arguments -> IRVApp initialization -> app.exec()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard GUI launcher code with benign commented code",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a GUI application for hardware IR visualization, configuring logging and matplotlib backend, then launching the app. It uses external modules for core functionality. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. The code does not handle untrusted data insecurely, nor does it perform network operations or contain hardcoded secrets. The functions are straightforward wrappers for app execution. The commented logging code is benign. Overall, the code is a standard, benign visualization launcher with no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward GUI launcher for hardware IR visualization, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0, and the security risk score should be at or near 0, reflecting the benign nature.",
