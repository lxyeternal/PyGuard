  "purpose": "Minimal setup invocation for Python packaging using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Import of 'setup' from 'setuptools' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leaks, no external communication.",
  "flows": "Import of 'setup' -> call to 'setup()' with no parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and calls it with no arguments, which is a standard boilerplate for Python packaging. There are no data inputs, no external data processing, no suspicious code constructs, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. The code's simplicity and lack of parameters indicate benign intent. All signals point to a safe, standard setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all correctly set to 0, and confidence is high. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
