  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of Qt data models for internal visualization purposes. No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The minor logical bug does not impact security. The assigned scores of malware=0 and securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate; the latter could be lowered to 0 since no security concerns exist. Overall, the code is legitimate and secure for its intended use."
