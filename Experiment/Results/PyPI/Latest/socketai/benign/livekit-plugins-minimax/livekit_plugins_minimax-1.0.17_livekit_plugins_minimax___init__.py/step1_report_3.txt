{
  "purpose": "The code defines a plugin class for a TTS (Text-To-Speech) system, registers it, and manages documentation settings for unexported modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.tts, .version, .log) and external package (livekit.agents).",
  "sinks": "The code registers a plugin class which could potentially execute code during registration if Plugin.register_plugin() has side effects.",
  "flows": "The plugin class is instantiated and registered; no external input handling or data flow is apparent within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code appears to be straightforward plugin setup and documentation management.",
  "analysis": "The code imports local modules and an external plugin system, then defines a plugin class inheriting from a base Plugin. It registers the plugin, which may invoke registration routines in the external library. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious behavior is evident. The documentation cleanup at the end manages module documentation visibility without side effects. Overall, the code is standard plugin setup without malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving primarily as a plugin registration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
