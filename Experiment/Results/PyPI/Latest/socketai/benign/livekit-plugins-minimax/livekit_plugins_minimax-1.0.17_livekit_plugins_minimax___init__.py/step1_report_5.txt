{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define and register a plugin class for a larger application, importing modules and setting up documentation and logging.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.tts, .version, .log) and an external module (livekit.agents.Plugin). No direct input or data reading found.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations or external communication detected.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code mainly initializes classes and registers plugins without handling external or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports. The registration of a plugin class appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports internal modules and a Plugin class from an external package. It defines a subclass MinimaxPlugin that registers itself as a plugin. The code also manages documentation visibility for unexported modules. No external inputs, network communications, or data manipulations are present. The code structure and imports appear typical for plugin registration and module setup. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard plugin registration setup with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It does not process external data or perform unsafe operations. Overall, it appears safe.",
