{
  "purpose": "The code defines a plugin class inheriting from an external Plugin base, registers it, and manages module documentation visibility. It serves as a plugin registration and documentation management script.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.tts, .version, .log), external Plugin class from livekit.agents, and module directory listing.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "Import statements and class definition lead to plugin registration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing modules, defining a plugin class, registering it, and cleaning up documentation exports. No data processing, network activity, or external data handling occurs. The plugin registration relies on an external class, which could theoretically invoke external code, but no evidence suggests malicious behavior. The documentation cleanup is benign. Overall, the code is standard plugin setup with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The plugin registration process is typical, and the code structure is straightforward. The minimal security risk stems from the plugin registration routine, but no evidence indicates malicious activity.",
