  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality:**\n   - All reports describe the code as simply importing `getLogger` from the `logging` module and creating a logger named `'livekit.plugins.minimax'`.\n   - The original code snippet confirms this: it does exactly that, with no additional logic, input, output, or external interactions.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden behaviors.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as standard logging setup.\n   - No errors or flaws are evident or implied.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Malware and Risk Justification:**\n   - The malware score is zero across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The security risk score is also zero, which aligns with the absence of any vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - Since the code is purely for setting up logging, there's no reason to assign higher scores.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about potential vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable scores are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThe code snippet is a standard, benign logging setup with no security issues or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
