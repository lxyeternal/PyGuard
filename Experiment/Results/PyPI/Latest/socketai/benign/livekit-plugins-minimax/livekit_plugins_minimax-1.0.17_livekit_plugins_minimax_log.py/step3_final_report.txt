  "purpose": "Setup a logger named 'livekit.plugins.minimax' for logging purposes within an application.",
  "sources": "Import of getLogger from the logging module.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports getLogger from the logging module and creates a logger instance with a specific name. It does not accept external input, perform data processing, network communication, or contain obfuscation. The code is minimal, standard, and does not include any suspicious or malicious constructs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with its benign nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging setup with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports accurately reflect this, and the scores are appropriate.",
