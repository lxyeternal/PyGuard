  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only sets up logging infrastructure.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'getLogger' function from the logging module and creates a logger named 'livekit.plugins.minimax'. This is standard logging setup without any suspicious or malicious behavior. The code is minimal and does not perform any data processing, input/output, or network operations. No obfuscation or hidden behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a straightforward setup for logging purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
