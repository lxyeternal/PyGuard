  "purpose": "Assigns version information for a Python package.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward assignment with no suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string to __version__, a common practice in Python packaging. It contains no input reading, data processing, external interactions, obfuscation, or malicious code. All reports correctly identify this as benign. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior justify zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code and consistent expert reviews.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless version string assignment with no security issues, malicious intent, or obfuscation. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
