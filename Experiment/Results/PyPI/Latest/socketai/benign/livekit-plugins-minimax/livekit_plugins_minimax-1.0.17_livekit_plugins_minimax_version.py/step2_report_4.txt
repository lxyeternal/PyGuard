  "review": "Let's review the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no input reads, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and contains no issues.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the simplicity of the code.\n   - They correctly identify that this is standard version declaration code with no security concerns.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - No changes needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a version string assignment with no malicious activity, scores should remain at 0.\n   - Any higher score would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - Malware score should be 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions and recognize the code's benign nature.\n   - No unwarranted vulnerability claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n\nThis code fragment is a standard, benign version declaration. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.",
