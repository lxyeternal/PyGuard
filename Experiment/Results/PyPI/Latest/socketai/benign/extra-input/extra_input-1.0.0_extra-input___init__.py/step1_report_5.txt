{
  "purpose": "This __init__.py file is used to import all functions and classes from the selectingInputs and specializedInputs modules, likely to expose them at the package level.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing everything from selectingInputs and specializedInputs modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data or potentially dangerous operations are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - import statements only, no data flow operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can be considered a bad practice as it may hide imported names and make the code less clear, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code simply re-exports all contents from two modules via wildcard imports. There are no inputs, no data processing, no network activity, or other typical malicious behaviors. The use of wildcard imports can introduce namespace pollution but does not directly suggest malicious intent. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This __init__.py file serves as a module aggregator, facilitating easier imports in the larger project. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks based on this code.",
