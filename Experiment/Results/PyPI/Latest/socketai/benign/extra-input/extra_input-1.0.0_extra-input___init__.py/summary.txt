  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initializer with no malicious behavior detected. The use of wildcard imports is a best practice concern but does not constitute a security threat in this context. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) reflecting the import practice concern."
