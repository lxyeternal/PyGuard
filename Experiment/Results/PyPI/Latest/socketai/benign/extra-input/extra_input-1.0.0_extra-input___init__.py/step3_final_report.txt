  "purpose": "Package initialization by importing all contents from selectingInputs and specializedInputs modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from .selectingInputs and .specializedInputs modules using wildcard '*'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; potential concern is obscured imported content which could hide malicious code",
  "flows": "Imported modules' contents are brought into the namespace; no data flow or external communication observed",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*'), which can obscure imported symbols and hinder security auditing",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py file that imports all symbols from two modules via wildcard imports. No signs of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The wildcard import practice is discouraged but not inherently malicious. Given the absence of suspicious patterns, network activity, or code manipulation, the code appears benign. The primary concern is maintainability and clarity, not security risk. The imported modules' contents are unknown, so potential malicious code within them cannot be assessed here. Overall, the code is straightforward and safe, with the only notable issue being the use of wildcard imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initializer with no malicious behavior detected. The use of wildcard imports is a best practice concern but does not constitute a security threat in this context. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) reflecting the import practice concern.",
