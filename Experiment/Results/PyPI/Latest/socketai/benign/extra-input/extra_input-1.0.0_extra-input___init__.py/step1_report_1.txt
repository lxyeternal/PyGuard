{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a package by importing all contents from two modules: selectingInputs and specializedInputs.",
  "sources": "Imports from selectingInputs and specializedInputs modules",
  "sinks": "Import statements that load code from other modules; no direct data sinks or output points are evident",
  "flows": "Imports from modules potentially containing input handling or sensitive code; no explicit flow observed in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*'), which can obscure the specific imported functions or variables and potentially import malicious or unintended code",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py file that imports all contents from two sibling modules. The use of wildcard imports is a concern because it can hide what exactly is being imported, making the code harder to audit and potentially allowing malicious code in the imported modules to execute unknowingly. However, there is no direct malicious behavior evident in this snippet itself. The overall security depends on the content of the imported modules, which are not shown here.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a package initializer and does not contain malicious code by itself. The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports, which can make security auditing difficult and potentially hide malicious code in the imported modules. Without additional context on the contents of those modules, the code appears benign but warrants review of the imported modules.",
