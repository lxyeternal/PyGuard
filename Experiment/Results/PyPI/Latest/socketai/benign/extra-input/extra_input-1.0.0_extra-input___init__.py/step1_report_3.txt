  "purpose": "This code initializes a package by importing modules 'selectingInputs' and 'specializedInputs'.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations observed.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow; only module imports without data processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The __init__.py file is straightforward, importing all contents from two modules. It does not perform any data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code is minimal and standard for package initialization, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple package initializer with no malicious or suspicious elements. It appears benign and standard for Python package setup.",
