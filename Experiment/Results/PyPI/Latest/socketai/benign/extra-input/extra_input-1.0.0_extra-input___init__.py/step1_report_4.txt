  "purpose": "The code is a module initialization file that imports all contents from the 'selectingInputs' and 'specializedInputs' modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from two local modules: 'selectingInputs' and 'specializedInputs'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or actions; no function calls or data processing is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths are present in this minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present. The code is straightforward module import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports all contents from two modules during package initialization. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, no dynamic execution, and no data handling or network activity. The lack of additional logic or obfuscation suggests this is a standard package setup file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Python package initialization file with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected. It simply re-exports contents from other modules for ease of access.",
