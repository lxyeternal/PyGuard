  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical flaws, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple __init__.py file that imports all contents from two modules: selectingInputs and specializedInputs.\n- The primary concern across reports is the use of wildcard imports ('*'), which can obscure what is imported and potentially hide malicious code.\n- No reports indicate any actual malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activities within this snippet.\n- The code is minimal and standard for package initialization, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- **Wildcard imports ('*')** are used in all reports, which can reduce code clarity and make auditing difficult. However, this alone does not imply malicious intent.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports correctly identify the use of wildcard imports as a concern but do not overstate the risk, which is appropriate.\n- No report claims the presence of actual malicious code, which aligns with the code snippet.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.3, primarily due to the use of wildcard imports. This is reasonable, as wildcard imports can hinder security auditing but are not inherently malicious.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores seem appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- Since no actual malicious activity is detected, a malware score of 0 is correct.\n- The security risk score could be slightly higher if considering the potential for malicious code in imported modules, but given only this snippet, the assigned scores are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.3, reflecting the concern over wildcard imports but not indicating high risk.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (acknowledging the wildcard import issue but no actual malicious activity)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard package initializer with no malicious behavior. The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports, which can hinder security auditing but do not directly introduce malicious code. The assigned scores are reasonable and should remain low unless additional context reveals malicious modules.\n\n**Final note:** Always review the contents of `selectingInputs` and `specializedInputs` modules to ensure they do not contain malicious code, as the security of this package depends on their integrity.",
