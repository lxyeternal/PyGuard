{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a package by importing all contents from two modules: selectingInputs and specializedInputs.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules selectingInputs and specializedInputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') which can obscure actual imported content; no suspicious behavior or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The __init__.py file serves as a package initializer, importing everything from two submodules. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. Wildcard imports can reduce code clarity but are not inherently malicious. No external data input, environment variable usage, or dangerous operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. It simply aggregates module contents for ease of use.",
