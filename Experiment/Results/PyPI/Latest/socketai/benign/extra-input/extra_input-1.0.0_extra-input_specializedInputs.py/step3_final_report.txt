  "purpose": "Input validation functions for integers, floats, and restricted character strings.",
  "sources": "User input via input() function calls.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Input() reads user data; validation occurs within the functions; no external data flow or system calls beyond input.",
  "anomalies": "Multiple definitions of 'intput' with different return type annotations, overwriting each other; no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward input validation routines relying on input(). The redefinition of 'intput' functions with different signatures is invalid in Python and causes logical errors, but it is a coding mistake, not malicious. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1) are appropriate; the main concern is the function redefinition bug, which could cause runtime errors but not security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe from a security perspective, with a minor coding mistake that should be corrected. There is no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain attack. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correct.",
