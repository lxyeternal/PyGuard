{
  "purpose": "The code provides user input functions that validate and restrict input types (integers, floats, specific characters).",
  "sources": "The input() function calls serve as sources where the code reads user input.",
  "sinks": "The input() responses are processed locally; there are no data sinks that send data elsewhere or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "User input flows from input() to validation checks and possibly returned to caller; no external data transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. Function redefinition with the same name ('intput') for different types might be confusing but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions: two named 'intput' (which is likely a typo of 'input')—one for integers, one for floats—and one for custom character validation. The duplicate function names cause redefinition, leading to only the last definition ('float' input) being effective. The first 'intput' for integers is overwritten and thus non-functional. All functions rely on standard input() calls with straightforward validation. There are no external data transmissions, malicious system modifications, or suspicious behavior observed. The duplicate function names could indicate poor code quality or mistake but not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or security risks; however, the redefinition of functions with the same name ('intput') could cause confusion or bugs but is not malicious. No signs of malware, data leaks, or malicious external interactions are present.",
