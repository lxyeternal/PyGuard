  "purpose": "Provide input functions for integers, floats, and restricted character input with validation.",
  "sources": "Input functions using Python's built-in input() to read user input.",
  "sinks": "Potential user-provided data processed and returned; no external sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "User input flows from input() to validation, then to return if valid.",
  "anomalies": "Redefinition of the function 'intput' with different return types (int and float), which is syntactically invalid in Python; no malicious anomalies or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains three functions: two named 'intput' but with different return type annotations (which would cause a syntax error in Python), each performing input validation for integers and floats respectively, and one 'custom_input' that restricts input characters. All functions rely solely on user input via input(), perform validation, and then return the validated data. There are no external network calls, no data leaks, no suspicious behavior, or malicious code such as backdoors or data exfiltration. The function redefinition issue appears to be an error rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be simple, input validation functions with a structural error due to redefinition of 'intput'. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The redefinition likely indicates a bug or typo, not malicious intent.",
