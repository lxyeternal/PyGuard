  "anomalies": [
    "Function redefinition: intput() is defined twice with different return types (int and float), which is invalid in Python and overwrites previous definition",
    "No use of untrusted data beyond input validation",
    "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns",
    "All functions perform straightforward input validation"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code defines three input functions to restrict user input to integers, floats, or specific characters. The functions use input() to receive user data and validate it, returning only when the input matches expected formats. A notable issue is that 'intput' is redefined with different return types, which would cause runtime errors or unintended behavior in Python, but this is not malicious. The code does not contain obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or any suspicious behavior. It appears to be standard input validation functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily designed for input validation with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The redefinition of 'intput' is an error but not malicious. Overall, the code seems safe and intended for user input sanitization.",
