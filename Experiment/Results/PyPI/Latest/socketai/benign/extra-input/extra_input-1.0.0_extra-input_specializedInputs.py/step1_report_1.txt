  "purpose": "The code provides input validation functions for integers, floats, and restricted character sets.",
  "sources": "Input functions reading data from the user via the input() function.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the input() function receiving untrusted user input; however, there are no further sinks like network transmission or file access.",
  "flows": "User input (source) flows into validation loops, which return the validated data; no external data is transmitted or stored.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code does not execute or process untrusted data beyond validation, and no obfuscated code is present. Function redefinitions with different signatures could be confusing but are not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple input functions that validate user input for integers, floats, and allowed characters. Each function uses a loop to prompt the user until valid data is entered, with exception handling for invalid formats. There are no network connections, data leaks, or malicious actions. The functions are straightforward input validators, with no signs of hidden or malicious intent. The redefinition of the 'intput' function with different signatures could be a minor issue but is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely implements input validation routines with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks detected. It is safe and does not pose supply chain threats.",
