  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- There are three functions:\n  1. `intput(text: str) -> int` — prompts user, returns an integer after validation.\n  2. `intput(text: str) -> float` — prompts user, returns a float after validation.\n  3. `custom_input(text: str, allowed: str, tellAllowed=True) -> str` — prompts user, restricts characters.\n\n**Key issues in the code:**\n- The function `intput` is defined twice with different return type annotations (`int` and `float`). In Python, this is invalid: the second definition overwrites the first, leading to only the last `intput` (the float version) being effective.\n- The code relies solely on user input validation, with no external data transmission, network activity, or file access.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present.\n- No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected.\n- The duplicate function name appears to be a typo or oversight, not an intentional malicious feature.\n\n**Review of the reports:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code is straightforward input validation with no malicious intent.\n- They note the redefinition of `intput` as a potential mistake, not malicious.\n- The reports assign a low security risk (~0.1) and malware score (0), which aligns with the code's nature.\n- Confidence levels are high (~0.8-0.9), indicating that the reviewers agree on the benign nature.\n\n**Critical observations:**\n- The primary concern is the invalid redefinition of `intput`. While this is a coding mistake, it is not malicious.\n- The code does not perform any suspicious actions like network communication, data exfiltration, or executing untrusted code.\n- The \"malware\" score is correctly zero.\n- The \"obfuscated\" score is zero; the code is straightforward.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to the coding mistake which could cause bugs but not security issues.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is safe, with a minor coding error.\n- The duplicate function name `intput` is a typo or oversight, not malicious.\n- No evidence of supply chain attack or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and simple.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, primarily due to the function redefinition mistake, which could cause bugs but not security issues.\n\n**Note:** If I were to suggest any change, it would be to correct the function naming to avoid redefinition errors, but this does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malicious intent or security risks. The main issue is a coding mistake that should be fixed for correctness but does not pose a security threat.",
