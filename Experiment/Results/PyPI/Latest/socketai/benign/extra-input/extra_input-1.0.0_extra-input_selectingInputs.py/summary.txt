  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The use of the 'roman' library is harmless, and the functions only process user input for menu selection. Scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code."
