{
  "purpose": "Provides user interaction functions for selecting options from a list, either by first letter or by numbered/roman numerals.",
  "sources": "User input via the input() function.",
  "sinks": "User input captured for processing; no direct data leaks or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "User input flows from input() to comparison logic for selecting options.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Uses the roman library for numeral conversions, which appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: select() and numbered_select(). Both functions prompt the user for input and compare it against options, with support for first letter, numbered, and roman numeral selections. Input handling is straightforward, with no evident insecure practices or malicious behaviors. No data is transmitted externally or stored insecurely. The roman library is used for numeral conversion but is a standard external dependency. No obfuscated or suspicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, focused on user option selection with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or system interference.",
