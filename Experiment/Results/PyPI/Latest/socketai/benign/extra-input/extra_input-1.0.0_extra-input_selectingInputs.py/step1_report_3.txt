{
  "purpose": "The code provides user interface functions for selecting options from a list, either by first letter or by numbered/roman numeral input.",
  "sources": "The code reads user input via the input() function.",
  "sinks": "User input data is used immediately for option selection logic; no data is sent externally or stored maliciously.",
  "flows": "Input() collects data → code compares input to options or Roman numerals → returns selected option.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior; no external network activity or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for user interaction: select() and numbered_select(). Both functions prompt the user for input and match responses to options via case-insensitive comparison. The roman module is used for Roman numeral conversions. The input handling appears standard, with no evident malicious logic. No obfuscated code, hidden calls, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's structure is straightforward and typical for CLI menus.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple user interface for option selection, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply processes user input to select options from lists, using standard methods and the roman library for numeral conversions.",
