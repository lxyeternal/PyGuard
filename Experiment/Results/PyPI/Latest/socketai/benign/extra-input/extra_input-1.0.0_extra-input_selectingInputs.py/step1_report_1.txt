{
  "purpose": "Provide user interface functions for selecting options from a list, either by letter or numbered/roman numeral input.",
  "sources": "User input via the input() function, reading responses for selection.",
  "sinks": "No sensitive data leaks or external data sinks detected; no network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "User inputs are compared against options and returned based on matching logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of 'roman' library appears to be for numeral conversions but not suspicious itself. No obfuscated code or dangerous dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for menu selection: 'select' and 'numbered_select'. Both functions prompt the user for input and compare the response to options. Input is used solely for comparison to options and returned accordingly. The 'roman' library is used to convert numbers to Roman numerals for display and comparison; this is benign. No data is transmitted or stored insecurely. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or code injection. The code is straightforward and only interacts with the user via console input.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs basic user interface selection operations without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign utility for menu selection purposes.",
