{
  "purpose": "Provides user interface functions for selecting options from a list, either by first letter or by numbered/roman numeral input.",
  "sources": "User input via the input() function; options list provided as function argument.",
  "sinks": "User input processed for option selection; no untrusted data written to external systems; no external calls or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input from user flows from input() to comparison checks, ultimately returning a selected option based on user input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of the roman library for converting numbers to Roman numerals; no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code; no suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions, select() and numbered_select(), both designed for menu-based user input handling. They display options and process user responses to select an item from the provided list. The code uses the roman library solely for converting integers to Roman numerals, which is a benign utility. There are no data leaks, code injections, or malicious behaviors such as network access, file manipulation, or privilege escalation. The functions rely entirely on user input and standard output, with no external or unsafe operations detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign menu selection implementation without malicious intent or security risks. It only interacts with user input and prints options, with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior.",
