{
  "purpose": "Provides CLI menu selection functions for user interaction, utilizing the 'roman' library for numeral conversions.",
  "sources": "User input via input() function, options list for menu display.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks, network activity, or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "User input is compared against options and Roman numeral conversions to determine selection; no external data flow or malicious data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard input/output and library usage.",
  "analysis": "The code implements simple CLI menu functions with benign use of the 'roman' library. It handles user input securely, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The functions perform string comparisons and display options, with no external communication or data leaks. The logic is transparent and standard for menu selection utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The use of the 'roman' library is harmless, and the functions only process user input for menu selection. Scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
