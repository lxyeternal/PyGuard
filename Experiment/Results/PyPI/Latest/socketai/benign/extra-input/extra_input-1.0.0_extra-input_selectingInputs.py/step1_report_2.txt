  "purpose": "Provides functions for user selection from options with different input methods and formats.",
  "sources": "Reads user input via input() function calls.",
  "sinks": "Uses input() responses for comparison to options; no other data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "User inputs are captured, normalized, and matched to options; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward, no obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two user-interaction functions: select() and numbered_select(). Both functions prompt for user input and match responses to options. Usage of the roman library is for converting numbers to Roman numerals. There are no data leaks, network operations, or malicious code patterns. The code appears to be designed solely for user menu selections, with no hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign user interface utility with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It simply reads user input for menu selections, with no external communications or security vulnerabilities detected.",
