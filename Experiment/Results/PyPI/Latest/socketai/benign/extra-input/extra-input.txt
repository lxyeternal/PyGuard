The use of wildcard imports is a best practice concern but does not constitute a security threat in this context. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) reflecting the import practice concern."

Scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code."
