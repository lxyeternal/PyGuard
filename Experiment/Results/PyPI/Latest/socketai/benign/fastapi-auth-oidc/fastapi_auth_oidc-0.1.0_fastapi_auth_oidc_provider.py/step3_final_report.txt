  "purpose": "JWT-based OpenID Connect authentication provider for FastAPI, validating tokens via external JWKS.",
  "sources": "Authorization header in HTTP request, specifically the 'Authorization' header with 'Bearer' scheme.",
  "sinks": "Decoded JWT claims returned as user info; exceptions raised on invalid tokens.",
  "flows": "Request headers -> _extract_creds() -> _decode_jwt() -> return claims or raise exception.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Error handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard JWT validation: extracts 'Authorization' header, verifies 'Bearer' scheme, decodes JWT with external key via factory.jwks(), handles expiration and verification errors, and returns claims. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Exception handling is appropriate, and external key retrieval is typical for dynamic key management. The security posture aligns with best practices, with no signs of supply chain attack or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of JWT-based OIDC authentication for FastAPI, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, reflecting low residual risk due to external key fetching. Overall, the code is safe and standard.",
