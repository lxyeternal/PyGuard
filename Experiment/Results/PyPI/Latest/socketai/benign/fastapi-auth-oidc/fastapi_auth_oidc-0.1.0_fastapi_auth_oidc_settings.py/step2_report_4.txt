  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Imports `BaseSettings` from `pydantic_settings`.\n- Defines a class `Settings` with four optional string attributes for OIDC configuration URIs.\n- No input/output, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code, no network operations.\n- Overall, a straightforward configuration class.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Accurate; standard config class, no malicious behavior.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correct; environment variables are typical sources, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Accurate; straightforward, no malicious intent.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Accurate; no input/output or malicious code.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correct; no secrets or suspicious code, standard pattern.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Observation:** The securityRisk is marked as 0.1, which is very low, but given the code's nature, even this seems slightly overestimated. The code itself does not introduce any security risk.\n- **Verdict:** The score seems slightly high for such benign code; I would recommend setting `securityRisk` to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All agree on 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0 or very close, but Report 5's 0.1 is marginally high considering the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### **My final evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk; the code is a benign configuration class)\n\nThe code is a straightforward, standard configuration class with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the code's benign nature. The only minor point is the slightly elevated `securityRisk` in Report 5, which I would set to zero. No changes are necessary for the malware or obfuscated scores.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **SecurityRisk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's actual security posture.",
