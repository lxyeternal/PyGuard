  "purpose": "Define a configuration class for OpenID Connect (OIDC) endpoints using environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed by pydantic_settings during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Environment variables serve as sources; pydantic_settings loads them into class attributes; no data flows to sinks within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple class declaration inheriting from pydantic_settings.BaseSettings, with four optional string attributes for OIDC configuration URIs. It relies on environment variables for configuration, which is standard practice. No input/output operations, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is clear, readable, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with the exception of report 5's slightly elevated security risk score of 0.1, which is unwarranted given the code's simplicity. The appropriate scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 for all reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration class with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor elevation of the security risk score in report 5 should be corrected to zero for consistency. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
