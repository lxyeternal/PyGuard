  "purpose": "Define a configuration class for OIDC settings using pydantic's BaseSettings for environment-based configuration.",
  "sources": "The class reads configuration values for OIDC from environment variables or other sources managed by pydantic_settings.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if environment variables are manipulated or untrusted sources influence these values, they could affect runtime behavior or leak information. However, this code itself does not perform data sinks.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or external sources provide values to the class attributes at runtime, influencing the application's configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and typical for configuration management.",
  "analysis": "The code imports BaseSettings from pydantic_settings, then defines a Settings class with four optional string attributes for various OIDC configuration URIs. These attributes are intended to be populated from environment variables or external sources when an instance is created. There is no user input handling, no code injection, no obfuscated or malicious code, and no suspicious behavior. The design aligns with standard practices for managing application settings securely.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard configuration class using pydantic_settings. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly uses environment-based configuration management without hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
