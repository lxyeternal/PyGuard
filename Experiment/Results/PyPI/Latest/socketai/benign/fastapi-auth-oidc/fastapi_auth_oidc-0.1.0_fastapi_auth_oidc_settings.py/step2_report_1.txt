  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the underlying code:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines a class `Settings` inheriting from `pydantic_settings.BaseSettings`, with four optional string attributes for OIDC URIs.\n   - It does not perform any input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code relies on environment variables or external configuration sources via pydantic's mechanisms, which is standard practice.\n\n2. **Assessment of Each Report:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a standard configuration class, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.\n   - The analysis in each report is consistent, emphasizing the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which aligns with the clear and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All are 0 or very close to 0, which is justified as the code is purely configuration with no apparent vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The last report assigns a `securityRisk` score of 0.1, which is slightly higher than others. Given the code's nature, this seems unwarranted; the risk is effectively zero.\n   - No report suggests any vulnerability, such as hardcoded secrets, code injection, or malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a minimal, standard configuration class for OIDC settings.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n   - The consistent and appropriate scoring across reports supports that conclusion.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware Score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, as the code is benign and standard.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, safe configuration class with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, with the minor exception of the slightly elevated `securityRisk` in report 5, which should be adjusted to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always consider the context in which configuration code is used; if environment variables are manipulated maliciously at runtime, that could introduce risks. However, based solely on this static code snippet, the risk remains negligible.",
