{
  "purpose": "Define application settings using pydantic's BaseSettings to load configuration variables, primarily related to OIDC (OpenID Connect) endpoints.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data directly but relies on pydantic's BaseSettings which may load environment variables or configuration files.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform any data output, network operations, or dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from sources to sinks within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies present; the code uses standard class definition and type annotations for configuration variables.",
  "analysis": "The code imports BaseSettings from pydantic_settings and defines a Settings class with optional string attributes related to OIDC configuration URIs. It appears to be a straightforward configuration class, relying on pydantic's mechanisms to load environment variables or other sources for setting these values. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration class for loading OIDC-related settings. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
