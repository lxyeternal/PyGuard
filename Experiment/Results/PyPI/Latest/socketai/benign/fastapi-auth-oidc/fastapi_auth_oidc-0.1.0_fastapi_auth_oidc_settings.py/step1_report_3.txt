  "purpose": "Define application settings using the pydantic_settings library for configuration management.",
  "sources": "Environment variables or configuration files via BaseSettings class from pydantic_settings.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is being sent or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Configuration data is loaded from environment variables or configuration sources into class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code appears straightforward and uses standard library patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports BaseSettings from pydantic_settings to create a Settings class with optional string attributes for various OIDC-related URIs. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code simply defines configuration parameters without performing any actions, network operations, or data leaks. It relies on the pydantic_settings library for configuration management, which is a standard pattern. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical configuration class for managing OIDC URIs and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and standard.",
