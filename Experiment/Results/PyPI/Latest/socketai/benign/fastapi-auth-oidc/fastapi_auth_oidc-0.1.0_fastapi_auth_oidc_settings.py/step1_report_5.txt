  "purpose": "Define application settings using pydantic's BaseSettings for configuration management.",
  "sources": "Environment variables or external configuration files via BaseSettings",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data being sent or leaked within this code snippet",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment/config files into class attributes, but no untrusted data flows to dangerous sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. The use of optional strings indicates flexible configuration, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pydantic's BaseSettings to create a configuration class 'Settings'. It defines four optional string attributes related to OIDC configuration URIs. There are no dynamic code executions, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious logic. The code relies on environment variables or external configs for setting values, which is standard practice. No malware, obfuscated code, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, secure configuration class with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
