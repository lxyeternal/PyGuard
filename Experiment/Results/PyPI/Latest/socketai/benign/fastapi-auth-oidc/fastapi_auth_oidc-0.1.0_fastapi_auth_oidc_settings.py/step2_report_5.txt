  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code snippets.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code defines a `Settings` class using `pydantic_settings.BaseSettings`.\n- It declares four optional string attributes related to OIDC URIs and issuer.\n- The code is a straightforward configuration holder, relying on environment variables or external sources for values.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as a standard configuration class with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Also correctly states that the code is a typical environment-based configuration class with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to above, correctly notes the code's simplicity and standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, aligns with the understanding that this is a benign configuration class.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** The only deviation is a `securityRisk` score of 0.1, which seems to imply a slight concern. However, the report itself states no malicious behavior or security issues are present.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, but `securityRisk` is 0.1.\n- **Justification:** Since the code is purely configuration and does not perform any dangerous actions, the `securityRisk` score should remain at 0.\n- **Verdict:** The risk score should be adjusted to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assigned 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assigned 0.\n- **Security Risk Score:** For report 5, adjust from 0.1 to **0** since the code is benign and no security risk is evident.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThe code is a standard configuration class for managing OIDC URIs, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores should reflect that, with all set to zero.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are generally accurate.\n- The only correction is to set the `securityRisk` score for report 5 to 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n- No further concerns or potential vulnerabilities are identified.",
