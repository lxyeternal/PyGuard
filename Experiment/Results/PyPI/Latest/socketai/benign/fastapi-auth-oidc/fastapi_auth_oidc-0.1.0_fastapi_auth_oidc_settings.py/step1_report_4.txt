{
  "purpose": "Define a configuration class using Pydantic Settings for storing OIDC-related URIs and issuer information.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading sources present in the code).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output or untrusted data handling shown).",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since the code only declares a class with default attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward class definition with standard type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'BaseSettings' from 'pydantic_settings' and defines a subclass 'Settings' with optional string attributes for OIDC configuration URIs and issuer. There are no input or output operations, no dynamic code execution, nor hardcoded secrets. It appears to be a typical configuration class meant for managing application settings securely. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign configuration class for managing OIDC settings using Pydantic. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues.",
