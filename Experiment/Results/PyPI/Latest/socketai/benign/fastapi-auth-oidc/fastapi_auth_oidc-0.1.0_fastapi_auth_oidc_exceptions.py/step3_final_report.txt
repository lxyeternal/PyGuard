  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for FastAPI OIDC authentication handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception, no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, network calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow or execution beyond class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class inheritance with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two simple class definitions inheriting from Exception, with one subclass inheriting from the other. There are no inputs, outputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is standard for custom exception handling in Python, especially within web frameworks like FastAPI. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or security vulnerabilities are present. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
