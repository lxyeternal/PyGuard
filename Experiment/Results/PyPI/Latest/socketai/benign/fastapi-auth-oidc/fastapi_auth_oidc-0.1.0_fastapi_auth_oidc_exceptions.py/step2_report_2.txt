  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the reported issues, scores, and reasoning.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining two custom exception classes for FastAPI OIDC authentication.\n- They consistently state that the code is straightforward, with no data input/output, no malicious payloads, no obfuscation, and no security risks.\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, and the confidence is perfect (1).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code\n\n**Observation:**\n- The code snippet provided is:\n```python\nclass FastAPIAuthOIDCException(Exception):\n    pass\n\nclass UnauthenticatedException(FastAPIAuthOIDCException):\n    pass\n```\n- These are simple class definitions inheriting from Python's `Exception`.\n- No input/output, no data processing, no network activity, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports' assertion that there are no issues is correct.\n- No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The reports are consistent, detailed, and accurate.\n- They correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n- No errors, flaws, or logical mistakes are evident in the reports.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Review scores assigned to each issue\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — correct, as code is clear.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate, no malicious activity.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified, no vulnerabilities.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified, analysis is thorough.\n\n**Suggestion:**\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5\n\n- Since all reports assign a security risk of 0, and the code is benign, there's no justification for higher risk scores.\n- The malware score is also 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- No higher scores are warranted.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Challenge any claims based on assumptions\n\n- The reports do not assume malicious intent; they base their conclusion on the code's simplicity.\n- No assumptions are evident that could be challenged.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Ensure score consistency\n\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The high confidence reflects the straightforward analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Step: My own assessment\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is purely class definitions with no logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or vulnerabilities.\n- The purpose is clear and standard for exception handling.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\n\n- **Code issues:** None.\n- **Report accuracy:** Correct, no flaws.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate; no changes needed.\n- **Risk assessment:** No risk or malware detected; scores of 0 are justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is benign, with no security concerns. The existing reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
