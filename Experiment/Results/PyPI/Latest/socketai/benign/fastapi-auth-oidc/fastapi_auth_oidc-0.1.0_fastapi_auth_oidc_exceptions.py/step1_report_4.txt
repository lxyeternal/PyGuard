{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for authentication and OIDC-related errors in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; exception class declarations are static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class inheritance without data processing or transfer.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; code consists solely of exception class declarations without suspicious or unusual features.",
  "analysis": "The code declares two custom exception classes, inheriting from a base exception class for FastAPI OIDC authentication errors. These are straightforward class definitions with no embedded code, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard exception class declarations for use within a FastAPI application. No malicious behavior, security issues, or anomalies are present.",
