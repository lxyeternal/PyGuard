  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code consists solely of two simple exception class definitions inheriting from Exception.\n   - No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and does not contain issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that these are simple class definitions with no malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports and the code itself show no malicious activity or security concerns, a risk score above 0.5 is unjustified.\n   - The code is trivial and safe.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n   - This is consistent with the code content.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward analysis; no assumptions about hidden behavior are made.\n   - The assessments are accurate.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I concur with the reports' assessments. No malicious or risky behavior is present.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
