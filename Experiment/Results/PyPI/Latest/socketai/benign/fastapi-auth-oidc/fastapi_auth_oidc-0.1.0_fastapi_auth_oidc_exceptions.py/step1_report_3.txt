  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for FastAPI OIDC authentication errors",
  "sources": "No external input sources; exception classes are static definitions",
  "sinks": "No data flows or outputs; just class definitions",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward class inheritance with no unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes for use in a FastAPI OIDC authentication context. It establishes a base exception class and a derived exception for unauthenticated cases. There are no input/output operations, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs. The structure is simple and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely defines custom exceptions for authentication error handling. No malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks are evident.",
