  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code defines two classes:\n     ```python\n     class FastAPIAuthOIDCException(Exception):\n         pass\n\n     class UnauthenticatedException(FastAPIAuthOIDCException):\n         pass\n     ```\n   - These are straightforward custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`. The second inherits from the first, creating a specific exception for unauthenticated cases.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that these are simple class definitions with no data input/output, network activity, or malicious payloads.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - No evidence of hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or other security risks.\n\n3. **Analysis of Logic, Reasoning, and Summary**:\n   - The reports' reasoning is accurate; the code is benign and standard for defining custom exceptions.\n   - No logical flaws or security concerns are evident.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n     - confidence: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Malicious Behavior**:\n   - The code does not perform any operations beyond class declarations.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - The scores reflect this correctly.\n\n6. **Consistency and Reasonableness**:\n   - The uniform scores across reports are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n7. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions, the risk of malicious activity is negligible.\n   - The code could be part of a larger security-sensitive application, but on its own, it presents no issues.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a straightforward, benign implementation of custom exception classes for a FastAPI application. The reports' evaluations are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- No changes needed.\n- The code poses no security threat.\n- The scores are justified and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
