{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for FastAPI authentication and OIDC errors",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or external data handling occurs",
  "flows": "No data flow present as the code only declares classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns identified; the code is straightforward class declarations",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. The classes are intended for use in a FastAPI application for handling authentication and OpenID Connect (OIDC) errors. There are no input, output, or data flow mechanisms; the code contains no hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or obfuscated constructs. It is simple, standard Python class inheritance, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions for an authentication module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no anomalies, and no security risks present in this snippet.",
