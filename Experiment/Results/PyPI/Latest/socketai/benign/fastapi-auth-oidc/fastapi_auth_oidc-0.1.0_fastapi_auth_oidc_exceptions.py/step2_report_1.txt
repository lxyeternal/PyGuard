  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe provided code defines two custom exception classes:\n```python\nclass FastAPIAuthOIDCException(Exception):\n    pass\n\nclass UnauthenticatedException(FastAPIAuthOIDCException):\n    pass\n```\nThis is a straightforward class inheritance pattern, typical for custom exceptions in Python, especially in web frameworks like FastAPI. There are no data inputs, outputs, network calls, or code execution behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. The code is benign and does not contain any security issues or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  The reports uniformly state that the code is simple, standard, and benign, which aligns with the actual code. No errors are evident in their reasoning.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code. Their confidence levels are 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n  Since no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are detected, higher scores are unjustified.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as harmless.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly identify that the code is purely class definitions with no malicious intent or security issues.\n- The overall risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence scores of 1 are justified, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious features. The uniformity and clarity across all reports support this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
