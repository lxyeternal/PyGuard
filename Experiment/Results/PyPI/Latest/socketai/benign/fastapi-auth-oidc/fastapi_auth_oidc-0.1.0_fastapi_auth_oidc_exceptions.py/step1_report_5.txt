{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for FastAPI OIDC authentication errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions only",
  "sinks": "No data processing or output; exception classes do not lead to data leaks or effects",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows; classes are simply definitions without logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward class inheritance",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes, one inheriting from a general exception related to FastAPI OIDC authentication, and the other inheriting from the first. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code, and no suspicious constructs or obfuscation present. The code appears to be a typical pattern for custom exceptions, with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign class inheritance structure for exception handling related to FastAPI OIDC authentication. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
