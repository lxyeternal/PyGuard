  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for FastAPI OIDC authentication errors.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; exception classes are defined without data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or malicious actions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are simple exception definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, specifically for handling authentication errors in a FastAPI context. There are no data input/output operations, network activities, or code execution behaviors. The structure is straightforward and standard for exception class definitions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign implementation of custom exceptions with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
