  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of simple class definitions inheriting from Exception, with no data input/output, network activity, or dynamic behavior.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly note the benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n   - The conclusions that these are standard, harmless exception class definitions are justified.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a security risk of 0, and the code is straightforward class inheritance without any suspicious features, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The malware score is also 0, indicating no malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing code, exfiltrating data, or containing payloads.\n   - The malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to observable facts.\n   - The code is purely definitional, with no hidden or implicit malicious behavior.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward, benign implementation of custom exception classes for a FastAPI OIDC authentication context.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe code is harmless and standard. The scores assigned in the reports are correct and justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
