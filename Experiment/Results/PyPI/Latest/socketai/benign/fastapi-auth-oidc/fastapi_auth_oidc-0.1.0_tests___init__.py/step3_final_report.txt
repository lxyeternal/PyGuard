{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform benign data processing or utility functions, with no malicious intent evident.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, user input, or external modules; no specific data sources detailed.",
  "sinks": "Potentially network, file, or system operations, but no explicit sinks are demonstrated.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks such as network or file systems, but no concrete flow paths are provided.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippets are either benign or absent. The assessments correctly identify no malicious activity, with confidence levels reflecting limited context. Scores for malware and obfuscation are zero, and security risk scores are low (0.2), indicating minimal concern. The reasoning is consistent and cautious, with no evident anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on static analysis, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate given the limited information. Overall, the dependency appears safe, with no immediate security issues.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
