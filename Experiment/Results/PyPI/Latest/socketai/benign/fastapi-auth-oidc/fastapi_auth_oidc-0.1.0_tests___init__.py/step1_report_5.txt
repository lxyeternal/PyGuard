  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific function or task, but the actual intent is unclear without further context. There are no obvious comments or documentation to clarify its intent.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, imported modules, and possibly external network calls if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network operations, file I/O, subprocess calls, or data exfiltration points if any exist in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through various functions or processes towards sinks, possibly involving data manipulation or transformations.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual features include hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, obfuscated variables, or network connections to suspicious domains. No such anomalies are explicitly evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for malicious behavior, including backdoors, data theft, code injection, or suspicious network activity. No malicious payloads or backdoors were identified. Usage of third-party libraries is standard, and no suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code were detected. The overall structure is straightforward and does not exhibit signs of obfuscation or malware. Without additional context or external dependencies, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to be a standard implementation without hidden malicious intent or security flaws.",
