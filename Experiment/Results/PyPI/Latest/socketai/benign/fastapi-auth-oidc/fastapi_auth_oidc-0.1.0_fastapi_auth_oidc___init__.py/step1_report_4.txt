  "purpose": "The code initializes an OIDC authentication object using a factory method from an imported module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .factory and assignment to OIDCAuth",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet",
  "flows": "Import reads module, OIDCAuthFactory invocation creates an object, assigned to OIDCAuth",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or obfuscation; simple factory pattern usage",
  "analysis": "The code imports a factory class for OIDC authentication, sets a version string, and creates an instance of the auth object. No input, no data leaks, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. The pattern is typical for modular authentication setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module initialization for an OIDC authentication component. No malicious behavior, no security risks identified in this snippet.",
