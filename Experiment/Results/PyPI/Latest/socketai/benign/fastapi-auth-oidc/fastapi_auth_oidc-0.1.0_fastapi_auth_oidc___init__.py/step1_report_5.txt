  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize an OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication object using a factory pattern.",
  "sources": "Importing OIDCAuthFactory from a local module '.factory'. Assigning version string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "Import from local module to create an OIDCAuth instance; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is minimal and standard for module initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class or function from a local module, sets a version string, and creates an instance of OIDCAuth using the factory. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple initialization script for an authentication component, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign and standard.",
