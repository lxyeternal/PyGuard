{
  "purpose": "This code imports a factory class for OIDC authentication and initializes an instance of it, likely for authentication purposes in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local 'factory' module",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "The imported class is instantiated into 'OIDCAuth', but no data flow from external untrusted sources is visible",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; code appears straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named 'OIDCAuthFactory' from a local module and creates an instance named 'OIDCAuth'. The version string is set to '0.1.0'. There are no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity or data handling present in this snippet. It appears to be a typical setup for authentication configuration, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup snippet for OIDC authentication, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It contains no obfuscation, no suspicious data flows, and no malicious code patterns.",
