{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define a version string and instantiate an authentication object via a factory pattern, likely for OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication.",
  "sources": "Import from .factory module, access to __version__, instantiation of OIDCAuth via OIDCAuthFactory()",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present",
  "flows": "Import from factory -> instantiate OIDCAuth object",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a factory, setting a version string, and creating an object using the factory. No external data sources, no input handling, and no suspicious operations are evident. The import suggests dependency on external factory code, but nothing in this snippet indicates malicious intent. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or complex logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs basic object creation, and contains no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
