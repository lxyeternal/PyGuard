{
  "purpose": "The code imports a factory class for OIDC authentication, sets a version string, and creates an instance of the factory.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local 'factory' module, assignment of __version__, instantiation of OIDCAuth.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, user input, or external data sources are present.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a class, defining a version, and creating an object. No input/output, no external connections, and no security-sensitive operations are performed within this snippet. The import is relative but typical in package modules. The instantiation of OIDCAuthFactory suggests setup of an authentication component, but without further code, no malicious intent or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues identified. It is a simple module setup snippet.",
