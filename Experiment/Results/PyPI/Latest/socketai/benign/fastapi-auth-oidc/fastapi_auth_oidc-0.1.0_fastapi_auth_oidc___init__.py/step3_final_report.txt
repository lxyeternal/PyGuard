  "purpose": "Minimal setup for an OpenID Connect authentication object, importing a factory class, setting a version string, and instantiating the auth object.",
  "sources": "Import from local module '.factory', setting __version__, instantiation of OIDCAuth via factory.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import source to factory instantiation, with no external data flow or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing a factory class, defining a version string, and creating an instance. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features. The confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty of benign intent. The code relies on an external factory, but no evidence suggests maliciousness from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate, and the current scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
