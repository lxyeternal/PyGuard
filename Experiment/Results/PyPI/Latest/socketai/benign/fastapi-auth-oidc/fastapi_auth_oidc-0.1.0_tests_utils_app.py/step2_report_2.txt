  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard OIDC authentication setup with FastAPI; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code; configuration URL is a placeholder.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The code does not contain any malicious or suspicious patterns.\n- The configuration URL is a placeholder, but that is typical for example code.\n- Returning user info directly is standard, though it could leak sensitive data if misused, but that is a known risk.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem appropriate. The securityRisk is low but non-zero, acknowledging potential data leakage if misused.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard OIDC setup; placeholder URL; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Same reasoning applies; no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- Slightly lower securityRisk score, which is reasonable given the context.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard OIDC integration; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- No issues detected; data returned is user info, which is typical.\n- The confidence is perfect; no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous; standard OIDC authentication; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- No malicious behavior; standard practices.\n- Slightly higher securityRisk, which is acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others; standard OIDC setup; no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- No issues; the code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly note no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are reasonable, considering potential data leakage if user info is sensitive.\n- **Confidence:** High, as the analysis is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- The code relies on an external OIDC provider URL, which is a placeholder. In real deployment, if this URL points to a malicious or compromised provider, risks could increase. However, based on the code and reports, no such issues are evident.\n- Returning user info directly can be sensitive, but this is typical for such endpoints. Proper access controls are assumed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Given the straightforward implementation and no suspicious behavior, I would assign a **0.1 to 0.2** risk score, aligning with the reports.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports' scores)\n\nThis reflects a standard, secure implementation with minimal risk, assuming the external OIDC provider is trustworthy.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes needed in the scoring.\n- The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The slight security risk is acceptable and typical for such configurations.\n\n**Final note:** Always verify the actual OIDC provider's trustworthiness in deployment; the placeholder URL itself isn't malicious but could be if replaced with a malicious endpoint.",
