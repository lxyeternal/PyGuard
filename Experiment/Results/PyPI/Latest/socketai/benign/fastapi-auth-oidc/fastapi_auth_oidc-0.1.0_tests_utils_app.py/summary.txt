  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of OIDC authentication in FastAPI with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minimal security risk is due to data exposure potential, which is typical for such endpoints. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
