  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code implements a standard OIDC authentication setup in FastAPI.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code are identified.\n- The configuration URL is a placeholder (https://example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration), which is typical for example code.\n- The user data is returned directly, which is standard but could pose data leakage concerns if sensitive info is included—though this is a common pattern.\n- No obfuscated code, suspicious external calls, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9 or 1), indicating the reviewers are confident in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Issue Presence and Code Logic\n\n**Are the issues reported actually present?**  \n- The code as provided is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.  \n- The user data is returned directly, which could be a concern if sensitive info is included, but this is typical for an auth endpoint.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- No issues or vulnerabilities are evident in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.  \n- They correctly identify that the code is standard, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.  \n- No logical errors or misinterpretations are apparent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- No notable errors or flaws in the reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Scores Evaluation\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n- All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity is detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n- All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n\n**Security Risk Score:**  \n- Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal concern, mainly about data exposure if sensitive info is returned.  \n- Given the code's nature, these scores seem reasonable.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \n- No change needed; the scores align with the findings.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2.  \n- The highest risk score is 0.2, which is acceptable for a standard auth endpoint that returns user info.  \n- No evidence of significant security risks justifies higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### Claims About Potential Vulnerabilities\n\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge that user data is returned directly, which could be a data leakage concern but not a vulnerability per se.\n- The external URL is a placeholder, not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- No unwarranted claims; the analysis is cautious and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of Scores\n\n- All reports' scores are consistent with their analyses.  \n- Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, risk scores are low, reflecting no malicious or suspicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' conclusions:**  \n- The code is a standard, secure implementation of OIDC authentication in FastAPI.  \n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (slightly above zero due to potential data exposure if sensitive info is returned, but still very low)\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                                  |\n|--------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0      | No malicious behavior detected.                                |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.              |\n| Security Risk      | 0.1    | Minimal risk; potential data leakage if sensitive info is returned, but no vulnerabilities. |\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe code appears secure, standard, and free of malicious intent. The low risk score is appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
