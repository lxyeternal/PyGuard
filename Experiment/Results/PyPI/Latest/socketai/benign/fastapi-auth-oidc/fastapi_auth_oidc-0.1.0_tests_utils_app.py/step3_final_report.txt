{
  "purpose": "Provides a FastAPI endpoint secured with OIDC authentication, returning user info upon successful authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from external OIDC provider URL; depends on user authentication input.",
  "sinks": "Returns user data directly, which could potentially leak sensitive information if misused.",
  "flows": "External URL (source) -> OIDCAuth dependency (source) -> Endpoint processing -> User data returned (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns detected; external URL is a placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of FastAPI with OIDC authentication. It relies on an external configuration URI, uses dependency injection for user info, and handles exceptions properly. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The user data is returned directly, which is typical but could pose data leakage risks if sensitive info is included. The external URL is a placeholder, common in example code, and does not indicate malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to data exposure, but no vulnerabilities such as code injection or hardcoded secrets are detected. The malware score is zero, obfuscation is absent, and confidence is high due to the code's clarity and standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of OIDC authentication in FastAPI with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minimal security risk is due to data exposure potential, which is typical for such endpoints. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
