{
  "purpose": "This code sets up pytest fixtures that mock external OIDC configuration and JWKS data for testing a FastAPI application, isolating external dependencies during tests.",
  "sources": "The code reads mock configuration data via patched properties in fastapi_auth_oidc.OIDCAuthFactory.",
  "sinks": "There are no data flows into external systems or untrusted data sinks; the code only supplies mocked data during tests.",
  "flows": "Mocked configuration data is supplied through patched properties during test execution, with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test setup using standard mocking techniques. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain malicious payloads. The use of patching is typical for isolating external dependencies in tests. No security vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe testing fixture with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports correctly identify its benign purpose, and the scoring is consistent with the code's behavior.",
