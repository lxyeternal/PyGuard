  "purpose": "This code provides test fixtures for a FastAPI application, including mocked configurations for OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment or configuration data via patching functions to mock OIDC settings and JWKS data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; the code only patches configuration methods and creates test clients.",
  "flows": "The code patches configuration functions to supply controlled test data, which are used during testing of the FastAPI app.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard testing practices with mocks and fixtures; no suspicious or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up testing fixtures for a FastAPI app, mocking the OIDC configuration and JWKS responses to facilitate isolated testing. It uses pytest fixtures and unittest.mock.patch, both standard testing tools. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are observed. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be safe, intended solely for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing setup with mocked configuration data for an application, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
