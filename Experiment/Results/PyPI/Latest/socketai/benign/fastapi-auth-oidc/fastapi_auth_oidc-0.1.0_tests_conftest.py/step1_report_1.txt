  "purpose": "Set up test fixtures for FastAPI application using mocks for OIDC configuration and JWKS retrieval",
  "sources": "Reads mock configuration data for OIDC issuer and JWKS from patched functions",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or external data transmission points present",
  "flows": "Test fixtures supply mocked data to application components during tests",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard testing pattern using patch and fixtures",
  "analysis": "The code defines test fixtures that mock OIDC configuration and JWKS retrieval, utilizing 'patch' to replace specific attributes in external libraries. It imports testing libraries, sets up a TestClient for the app, and uses patch to control external configuration data. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured testing setup with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test setup for a FastAPI application using mocked configurations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign and intended for testing purposes only.",
