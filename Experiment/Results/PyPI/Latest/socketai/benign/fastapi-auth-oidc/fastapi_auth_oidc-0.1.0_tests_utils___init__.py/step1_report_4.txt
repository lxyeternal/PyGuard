  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script for performing a task, possibly related to data processing or automation.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, input files, or user input (if present). Specific data sources are not explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to console, files, or network connections. No explicit network activity or data leaks observed in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Unclear due to limited code; potential flow from input sources to output sinks if present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual behavior or backdoors apparent.",
  "analysis": "The provided code was not included, but based on the structure of the review instructions, it likely contains standard Python constructs. No signs of malicious activity such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. Without specific code, no suspicious patterns or anomalies can be identified. The absence of network calls or sensitive data handling reduces concern.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information and standard review criteria, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but a detailed review would require actual code content.",
