{
  "purpose": "This code defines a factory class for creating OIDC authentication providers, handling configuration and JWKS URI fetching.",
  "sources": "Requests are made to external URIs for configuration and JWKS data via requests.get in the jwks() and configuration() methods.",
  "targets": "Untrusted data could be introduced if the fetched JSON is maliciously crafted, but the code does not directly execute or process untrusted data beyond JSON parsing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external URIs through requests.get calls into internal attributes (_jwks, _configuration), which are then used by the class properties.",
  "anomalies": "The properties userinfo_url and issuer incorrectly reuse self._jwks_uri instead of the respective URIs, indicating potential logical errors but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code fetches configuration data and JWKS data from external URIs, caching responses for 5 minutes. There are no hardcoded secrets or credentials. The misused properties suggest possible bugs rather than malicious activity. No obfuscated code, code injection, or malicious behaviors are present. External requests are standard for OIDC implementations but can be exploited if the URIs are maliciously controlled. The repeated use of self._jwks_uri in multiple properties may lead to logical errors, but this is likely a bug rather than malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement a typical OIDC configuration factory with some logical bugs in property implementations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The external requests could pose security considerations if URIs are compromised, but this is standard in such configurations. Overall, low malicious potential, primarily a logical issue.",
