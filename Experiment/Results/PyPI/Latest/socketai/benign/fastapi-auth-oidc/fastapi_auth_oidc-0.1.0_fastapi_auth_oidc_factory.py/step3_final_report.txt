{
  "purpose": "Provides an OIDC authentication provider factory that fetches configuration and JWKS data from external URLs with caching.",
  "sources": "External URLs for configuration, JWKS, and userinfo; requests.get() calls fetching JSON data.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs; JSON parsing; potential reliance on external data sources.",
  "flows": "Initialization uses URLs; properties access cached data or fetch new data; data used by OIDCAuthProvider.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated use of self._jwks_uri in properties 'userinfo_url' and 'issuer' instead of their respective variables; minor logical bugs.",
  "analysis": "The code fetches configuration and JWKS data via requests with caching, which is standard. The properties 'userinfo_url' and 'issuer' incorrectly reuse 'self._jwks_uri', indicating likely typos or bugs, not malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present. External URL fetches pose a typical security consideration but are not inherently malicious. The malware score is correctly 0, as no malicious activity is detected. The security risk score of 0.2 is justified due to external dependencies, but no active threats are evident. The logical bugs should be corrected for proper functionality, but they do not constitute security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard OIDC provider factory with minor logical bugs in URL property implementations. No malware or obfuscation is present. The low security risk score is appropriate given external URL reliance. Fixing the property bugs will improve correctness, but the overall security posture remains benign.",
