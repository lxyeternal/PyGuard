  "purpose": "Factory class for creating OIDC authentication providers, managing configuration and JWKS data fetching.",
  "sources": "Requests to URLs stored in configuration, JWKS URI, and configuration URI properties.",
  "kills": "Requests to external URLs for JWKS and configuration data.",
  "flows": "Initialization fetches configuration and JWKS data from URLs; requests.get called for each fetch; data stored and cached with timestamp checks.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated use of requests.get for URLs; possible typo in userinfo_url and issuer properties, both referencing jwks_uri and the same configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically fetches OIDC configuration and JWKS data, caching responses for 5 minutes. It uses requests.get for network access, which is standard. The properties for 'userinfo_url' and 'issuer' incorrectly reuse 'jwks_uri' and similar variables, which may indicate a logical error or typo, but not malicious intent. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No suspicious network activity beyond standard configuration fetches. No malicious payload or malicious code constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical implementation of an OIDC provider factory with a caching mechanism for remote configuration data. No evidence of malicious behavior or malware. Minor logical issues in property definitions are present but do not suggest security risks.",
