  "purpose": "Factory class for creating OIDC authentication provider instances, handling configuration and key retrieval.",
  "sources": "External network requests via requests.get to fetch JWKS and configuration data.",
  "sinks": "None directly; external network requests could lead to data leakage or injection if the endpoints are compromised.",
  "flows": "Requests to JWKS URI and configuration URI serve as sources; responses are processed and stored internally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no unusual code structures, no obfuscated code present. No suspicious behaviors or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a factory for OIDC authentication objects, retrieving configuration and keys via HTTP GET requests. It caches responses for 5 minutes. No data is written to files, executed dynamically, or handles sensitive data insecurely. There is no suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious behavior present. The network requests are to configurable URIs, which is typical for such classes. The code appears to be standard implementation for OIDC client setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard factory pattern implementation for OIDC authentication, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. It performs network requests for configuration and key data, which is expected behavior. No security risks or malware are evident.",
