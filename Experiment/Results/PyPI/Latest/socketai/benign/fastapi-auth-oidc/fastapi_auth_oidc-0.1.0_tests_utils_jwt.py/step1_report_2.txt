{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate and decode JWT tokens using RSA keys, and to provide JWT key settings for authentication purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads RSA private key from 'private_key.pem' file located in the parent directory of the script.",
  "sinks": "Uses the private key to sign JWT tokens and the public key to verify tokens; no untrusted data directly influences system behavior outside token handling functions.",
  "flows": "Reads private key from file -> loads key -> generates JWT settings -> signs JWT with private key -> decodes JWT with public key.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The key loading from a file is standard; no data leaks or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code securely loads RSA keys from a file, caches them for efficiency, and uses well-established libraries (cryptography and jose) for JWT operations. It generates RSA key parameters, encodes them in Base64URL, and constructs JWTs with standard claims. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The functions are straightforward and utilize standard cryptographic practices. There are no indications of malware or malicious data exfiltration. Overall, the code appears to be a standard implementation of JWT handling with proper key management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard JWT handling implementation with secure key management, no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. It reads keys from a file, performs cryptographic operations, and generates/decodes tokens as intended, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
