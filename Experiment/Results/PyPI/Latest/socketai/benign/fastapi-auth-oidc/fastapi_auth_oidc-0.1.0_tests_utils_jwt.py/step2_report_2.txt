  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, evaluating the reasoning, and assessing the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code loads RSA keys from a local PEM file, performs JWT signing and verification, and uses standard libraries.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or external data sinks are identified.\n- The key management practices appear standard, with no hardcoded secrets beyond the private key file path.\n- The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data flows.\n- The only potential concern is the fixed private key file path, which could be misused if the key material is malicious or compromised, but this is a typical scenario in controlled environments.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No, the code appears correct and standard.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None evident; the logic is sound.\n- **Scores assigned:** All are 0 for malware, obfuscated, with low security risk (~0.1-0.2). These seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The **malware score** is 0 across all reports, consistent with no malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- The **security risk** scores are low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the reliance on local key files, which is standard practice but could be risky if the key files are compromised.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- If the private key file path is compromised or malicious, it could pose a risk, but this is a typical scenario in key management, not necessarily a vulnerability.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent with each other, emphasizing the standard, secure handling of JWTs with RSA keys.\n- No contradictions or unreasonable scores are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, justified by key management practices)\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, due to reliance on local key files but no evident vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, secure implementation of JWT handling with RSA keys, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low risk score is appropriate, assuming proper key file security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- No issues confirmed.\n- No errors or suspicious logic.\n- Scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed.",
