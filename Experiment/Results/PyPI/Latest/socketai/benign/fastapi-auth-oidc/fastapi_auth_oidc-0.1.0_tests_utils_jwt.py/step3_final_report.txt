{
  "purpose": "The code handles RSA key loading, JWT creation, and verification for authentication purposes, using standard cryptographic libraries.",
  "sources": "Reads private RSA key from a local PEM file; extracts key parameters for JWT headers.",
  "sinks": "Uses cryptography and JWT libraries; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Loads key from file -> caches key -> uses key to sign JWTs -> decodes JWTs with public key.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; fixed private key file path is standard but could be a minor concern if compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard RSA key handling and JWT operations with proper caching and cryptographic practices. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The private key is loaded from a local file, which is typical; the fixed path could be a minor security concern but not malicious. No external data exfiltration or network activity is observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, low security risk 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented JWT handling module using RSA keys, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor security concern relates to key file management, which is standard practice but should be secured properly. Overall, the code is safe and aligns with best practices.",
