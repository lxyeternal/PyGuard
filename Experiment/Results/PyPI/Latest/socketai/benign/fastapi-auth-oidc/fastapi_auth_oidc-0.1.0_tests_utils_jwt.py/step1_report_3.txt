{
  "purpose": "This code manages RSA key pairs, generates and decodes JWT tokens using these keys, and provides utility functions for encoding.",
  "sources": "Reads private RSA key from 'private_key.pem' file, reads environment (if any), and uses internal functions for key and token management.",
  "sinks": "Uses cryptographic functions for key serialization and JWT encoding/decoding, with no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Reads key from file -> processes key data -> generates JWTs -> decodes JWTs; no external or untrusted data input beyond the private key file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data handling; code appears to handle cryptographic operations securely, but the private key file path is fixed and may be sensitive.",
  "analysis": "The code securely loads a private RSA key from a local PEM file, derives public key information, encodes JWTs, and decodes JWTs. Uses caching for key objects and configurations. No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. The only potential concern is the fixed path for the private key, which could be misused if the file contains sensitive or malicious key material. No network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is focused on cryptographic operations related to JWT handling with local key management. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks beyond typical cryptographic key handling. The private key management approach should be secured properly, but no malicious intent is apparent.",
