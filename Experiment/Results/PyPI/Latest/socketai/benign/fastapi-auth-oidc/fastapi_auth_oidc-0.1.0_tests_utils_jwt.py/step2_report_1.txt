  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scores, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; reads private key from local PEM file.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses standard cryptography and JWT libraries; no external data sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly states that the code performs standard JWT creation and verification with proper key management, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.1.  \n  The low security risk score is justified given the code's functionality; no issues detected.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate; no issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; reads key from local file.\n- **Analysis & Flaws:** Correctly notes the absence of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.1.  \n  These are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No problems here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar; fixed path for private key, which could be sensitive but not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** Proper cryptographic practices; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.2.  \n  Slightly higher security risk due to fixed private key path, but still within normal bounds.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent; loads key from disk.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity; standard key handling.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others; no external data influence.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior, payload, or exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly higher (0.1-0.2), justified by the fact that the private key is loaded from a local file, which could be sensitive. However, there's no indication of compromise or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — minor concern due to private key file handling, but not inherently risky or malicious.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-implemented JWT handling script using RSA keys, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor security risk relates to key management practices, which should be secured properly but are not malicious in nature.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code and analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
