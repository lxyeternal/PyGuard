{
  "purpose": "The code generates, encodes, and decodes JWT tokens using RSA keys for authentication and signing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads private RSA key from a PEM file located relative to the script, retrieves cached RSA key components, and uses them for JWT operations.",
  "sinks": "Uses cryptographic functions and the jwt library to sign and verify tokens; no external untrusted data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Reads private key file -> loads RSA key -> extracts key parameters -> creates JWTs with user data -> decodes JWTs for verification.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; key loading from file is standard. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script securely loads RSA private key from a local PEM file, caching it for efficiency. It converts RSA public parameters to Base64URL encoding for JWT header inclusion. JWT creation and decoding use standard libraries with proper algorithms. There are no apparent code injections, malicious data flows, or suspicious activities. The key management appears legitimate, with no hardcoded secrets. All cryptographic operations seem appropriate for standard JWT handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard JWT creation and verification using RSA keys loaded from a local file. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security compromises. It appears to be a typical implementation of JWT handling with proper cryptographic practices.",
