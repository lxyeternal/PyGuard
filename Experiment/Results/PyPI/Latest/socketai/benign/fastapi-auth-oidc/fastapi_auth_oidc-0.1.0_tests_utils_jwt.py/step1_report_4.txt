{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate, sign, and verify JWT tokens using RSA cryptography, and to provide JWKS data for public key distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the private RSA key from a PEM file on disk; reads environment variables or files only if specified (none in this code).",
  "sinks": "Uses cryptography library functions to load keys, encode/decode JWTs, and produce key material in PEM format.",
  "flows": "Reads private key from disk -> derives public key -> encodes/decodes JWTs -> provides key material for JWT validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated or suspicious code structures; no network communication or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a private RSA key from a file, converts key components to base64url format, generates JWTs with standard claims, and decodes JWTs for validation. It uses standard cryptography libraries and secure key handling practices. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code are evident. The key is read from a local PEM file, and no user input is directly involved that could lead to injection or injection-like vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for JWT handling with RSA keys. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. It securely manages key material and performs expected cryptographic operations without any hidden or harmful behavior.",
