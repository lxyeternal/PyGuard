{
  "purpose": "This code implements a simple logging utility class that formats and sends log messages to designated logging destinations.",
  "sources": "The code reads log messages generated within the methods (e.g., debug, error, info, warning, critical). It also reads exception info when exc_info=True is passed.",
  "sinks": "LogMessage function calls send log data to specified destinations, potentially external logging systems or files.",
  "flows": "Log message formatting occurs in the logIt method, which then forwards messages to LogMessage. If exc_info is true, traceback info is retrieved and logged. The setLevel method controls logging levels via EnableLog and DisableLog calls.",
  "anomalies": "The use of LogMessage and EnableLog/DisableLog suggests reliance on external functions for actual log handling; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior observed. No evident malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a logger class with methods to log messages at various levels. It formats messages and appends exception info if requested, then sends them through LogMessage. The setLevel method adjusts logging levels by enabling/disabling logs based on severity. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious data flows. The reliance on external functions (LogMessage, EnableLog, DisableLog) appears standard for a logging utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward logging utility without any apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard logging functions and manages log levels. No malware or security threats are evident from this code fragment.",
