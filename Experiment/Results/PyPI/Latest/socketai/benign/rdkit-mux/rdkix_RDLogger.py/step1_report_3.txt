{
  "purpose": "This code defines a logging utility class that manages log messages at different severity levels.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function arguments for log messages, optional exception info from sys.exc_info().",
  "sinks": "LogMessage function calls where log data is output to designated destinations, potentially to files or consoles.",
  "flows": "Logging functions pass message data to logIt, which then directs data to LogMessage; exception info flows from sys.exc_info() to logs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The use of LogMessage and sys.exc_info() is standard for logging.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard logging pattern, with functions for different log levels and a method to set log levels. The logIt function formats messages and logs exception info if provided. No suspicious or malicious patterns, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of global variables is typical for such utilities. No obfuscation or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is designed solely for log management purposes.",
