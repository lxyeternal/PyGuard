  "purpose": "A logging utility class that wraps external logging functions to output messages at various severity levels, including exception info when provided.",
  "sources": "Method parameters (msg, args, kwargs), sys.exc_info() for exception details",
  "sinks": "LogMessage function, which outputs logs to external logging system",
  "flows": "Input data (messages, exception info) flow into LogMessage calls; exception info may flow from sys.exc_info() to logs",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in 'critical' method logging to 'rdApp.error' instead of 'rdApp.critical', but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward logging utility with methods for different log levels, utilizing external functions for output. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious data handling is present. The reliance on external functions is typical and does not indicate malicious intent. The exception handling captures traceback info for logging. No hardcoded secrets or network activity are observed. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign logging utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The low security risk score (~0.1) is justified due to reliance on external functions but does not indicate any threat.",
