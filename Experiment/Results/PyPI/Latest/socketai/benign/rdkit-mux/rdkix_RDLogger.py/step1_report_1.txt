{
  "purpose": "This code implements a logging utility class for recording messages at various severity levels.",
  "sources": "The code reads data primarily from method parameters (msg, args, kwargs) passed to logging methods and the system's exception info during error logging.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the LogMessage function which outputs logs; if msg or exception details contain untrusted data, they could be logged directly.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input from method parameters flows into LogMessage, possibly including exception details if present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code uses standard logging practices and no suspicious code features are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a logger class that outputs log messages to a designated destination using the external LogMessage function. Logging levels are managed via enable/disable functions. Exception details are captured and logged if indicated. No external data sources or network interactions are involved. The code appears straightforward and standard for logging purposes, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical logging utility without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads. The design is conventional and safe.",
