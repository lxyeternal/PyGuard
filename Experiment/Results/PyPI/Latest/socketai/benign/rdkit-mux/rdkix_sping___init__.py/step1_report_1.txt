  "purpose": "Define package version information for spin Graphics",
  "sources": "Assignment statements creating version variables and a formatted version string",
  "sinks": "None; no data is being sent or used in a vulnerable manner",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only variable assignments and string formatting",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behavior; the comment with '$Id$' suggests version control keyword substitution, which is standard practice",
  "analysis": "The code sets version numbers as numeric variables and constructs a version string using string formatting. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or insecure practices. The presence of a version control keyword ('$Id$') is common for version tracking and does not indicate malicious activity. The code is straightforward and standard for version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. It is standard and benign.",
