  "purpose": "Static version declaration with version numbers and a version string.",
  "sources": "Assignment of numeric variables for major and minor versions, string formatting for version string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static code with no external inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "Variable assignments and string formatting; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of '$Id$' comment as a version control placeholder; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static numeric values to version components and constructs a version string via string formatting. It contains no external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The '$Id$' comment is a standard version control keyword, not malicious. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static version declaration snippet with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The scores and assessments are accurate and require no adjustments.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
