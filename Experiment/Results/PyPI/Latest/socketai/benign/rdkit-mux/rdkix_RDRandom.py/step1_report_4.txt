  "purpose": "To provide deterministic random number functions and a custom shuffle implementation for reproducible results in regression testing.",
  "sources": "Import of 'sys' for Python version checking, import of 'random' module for random number generation and shuffling.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only manipulates internal random functions for deterministic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code reassigns standard functions to control randomness but does not perform any malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'random' module and assigns its functions (random, randrange, seed) to local variables for use elsewhere, ensuring deterministic behavior. It checks the Python version to replace 'shuffle' with a custom implementation in Python 3.11 and above, to maintain reproducibility. The custom shuffle function uses the internal '_random._randbelow' and '_random._floor' functions, which are internal and non-public, but their usage appears solely for maintaining deterministic shuffling behavior. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code logic. The code is well-documented and focuses on reproducibility for regression testing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and aims to provide consistent random number outputs for testing purposes. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The usage of internal functions is justified for maintaining consistent shuffle behavior across Python versions. Overall, the code appears safe.",
