{
  "purpose": "To make random number generation consistent across runs for regression testing purposes by overriding default random functions.",
  "sources": "Import of random module, sys.hexversion to determine Python version, potential input for the shuffle function if a custom random function is provided.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is being sent to external systems or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code redefines functions for internal use, primarily affecting in-memory random number generation.",
  "anomalies": "The code reassigns standard random functions to potentially fixed or controlled versions, but there is no malicious intent or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the random module and reassigns its functions (random, randrange, seed) to local variables, effectively controlling random number generation. It checks the Python version and redefines the shuffle function to ensure reproducibility across different Python versions, especially post-Python 3.11 where behavior changed. The new shuffle function optionally accepts a custom random function but does not transmit data externally or perform malicious actions. The code aims solely at deterministic behavior for regression tests, with no signs of malicious payloads or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility designed to ensure reproducible random number generation for regression testing. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious external data handling. The code is well-structured for its purpose and does not pose a security risk.",
