{
  "purpose": "The code redefines and wraps Python's random number generation functions to ensure reproducibility of random sequences for regression testing.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'random' module (_random.random, _random.randrange, _random.seed), and sys.hexversion for version checking.",
  "sinks": "Uses functions like _random._randbelow and _random._floor internally within the custom shuffle function.",
  "flows": "The code assigns the imported functions to local variables, then conditionally defines a custom shuffle function that uses these internal functions, potentially utilizing a provided 'random' function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. The code only wraps standard library functions for reproducibility; no external network access, data exfiltration, or harmful operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing the 'random' module and sys. It then reassigns 'random' functions for use within the module. It checks the Python version; if Python 3.11 or newer, it redefines 'shuffle' to work around deprecations, using internal methods _randbelow and _floor. Otherwise, it uses the original _random.shuffle. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs, and the code appears to be a compatibility and reproducibility utility. No external input or data sinks are involved that could lead to security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a controlled and reproducible random number environment primarily for testing purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. It is a compatibility wrapper with no evident security risks.",
