{
  "purpose": "To override and standardize the behavior of Python's random functions for consistent reproducibility, particularly shuffling.",
  "sources": "Reading from the 'random' module (_random) and 'sys' module for version info.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data or interact with external systems; it only manipulates internal randomness functions.",
  "flows": "The code reassigns or overrides the functions 'random', 'randrange', 'seed', and 'shuffle' based on Python version, ensuring controlled randomness.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, backdoors, or hardcoded credentials are present. The code primarily modifies randomness functions for reproducibility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the standard 'random' module as '_random' and reassigns some of its functions to local variables. It then conditionally overrides the 'shuffle' function for Python versions >= 3.11 to maintain consistent behavior, especially regarding the random argument in shuffle. The override utilizes internal functions of the 'random' module. There is no external data interaction, and the modifications are for deterministic behavior, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a controlled modification of Python's randomness functions aimed at achieving consistent results for regression tests. It does not contain malicious code or behavior. The code's purpose is benign and related to reproducibility.",
