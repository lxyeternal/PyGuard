  "purpose": "Provide consistent random number generation for reproducible regression tests by wrapping Python's random module functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from random module (_random), sys for version checking",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No external data flows; uses internal standard library functions for random number generation",
  "anomalies": "Conditional redefinition of shuffle function based on Python version; no malicious code or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code reassigns the functions random, randrange, and seed to the corresponding functions from the random module, ensuring consistent randomness for regression testing. For Python >= 3.11, it redefines shuffle to maintain reproducibility, aligning with the original behavior despite deprecation. The code contains no external data input, no code injection points, or suspicious behavior. It strictly wraps standard library functions for a specific purpose. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility designed to ensure reproducible random number sequences. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The only notable aspect is the version-dependent redefinition of shuffle, which is a compatible and safe adaptation.",
