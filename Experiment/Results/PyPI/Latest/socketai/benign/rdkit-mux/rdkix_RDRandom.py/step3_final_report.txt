{
  "purpose": "Provides deterministic, reproducible random number generation for regression testing, ensuring consistent results across runs and Python versions.",
  "sources": "Reads from the standard 'random' module functions, particularly during shuffle operations and seed setting.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data leaks; internal functions are used for internal computation only.",
  "flows": "Uses internal functions (_random._randbelow, _random._floor) within the custom shuffle to maintain reproducibility, especially in Python 3.11+.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal, non-public functions (_randbelow, _floor) for maintaining behavior across Python versions; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code wraps Python's 'random' module functions to ensure deterministic behavior, especially handling Python 3.11 deprecations by redefining 'shuffle' using internal functions. No external data, network activity, or malicious code is present. The internal functions used are part of the standard library's implementation and are justified here for compatibility. No vulnerabilities, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are identified. The code is well-documented and purpose-specific, with scores reflecting benign intent. The use of internal functions is a minor concern but justified for reproducibility; it does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for reproducible randomness in testing environments. It does not contain malicious or security-threatening elements. The use of internal functions is justified for compatibility purposes, and no malicious intent is evident. Scores are consistent with this assessment.",
