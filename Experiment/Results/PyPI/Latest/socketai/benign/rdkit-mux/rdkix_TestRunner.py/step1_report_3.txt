{
  "purpose": "Provide context managers for redirecting and suppressing stdout and stderr streams, primarily for debugging, logging, or controlling output flow in Python scripts.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'RDKIX_BUILD_TYPE', accesses and modifies sys.stdout and sys.stderr, interacts with file descriptors and files specified by user inputs or context.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout, sys.stderr, system file descriptors (via os.dup2), and file objects for output redirection.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences behavior; context managers temporarily replace sys.stdout/sys.stderr or low-level file descriptors, then restore them, with optional output suppression or redirection to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secret leaks; no obfuscated code, no network activity, no suspicious data handling; code appears to be standard utility for output management.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Python context managers for redirecting or suppressing output streams. The environment variable 'RDKIX_BUILD_TYPE' is checked to determine build type, which is normal. The redirect classes modify sys.stdout and sys.stderr temporarily, and OutputRedirectC manipulates low-level file descriptors for suppression or redirection. No malicious logic, network activity, or backdoors are present. The code performs expected I/O stream management functions without suspicious patterns or behaviors. No signs of malicious intent or security risks were identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing output streams and does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It is designed for debugging or controlling output and does not pose security threats.",
