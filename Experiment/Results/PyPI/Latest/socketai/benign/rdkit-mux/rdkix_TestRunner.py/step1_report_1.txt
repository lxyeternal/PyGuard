{
  "purpose": "The code provides context managers for redirecting or suppressing standard output and error streams, primarily for controlling where program output is sent or to silence output temporarily.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'RDKIX_BUILD_TYPE' and sys.stdout, sys.stderr, and file descriptors via context managers.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the redirected output could be written to arbitrary files or suppressed, but no untrusted external data or network sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check flows into function isDebugBuild(). Stream objects (sys.stdout, sys.stderr) are redirected via context managers, which manipulate file descriptors and sys streams.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses standard Python modules and well-documented practices for output redirection. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages output redirection and suppression through context managers, using environment variables to determine build type. The stream redirection and low-level file descriptor manipulations are standard techniques with no malicious intent. All file operations are for redirection purposes, and there are no signs of malicious data exfiltration, code injection, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard output and error stream management utilities with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions, data leaks, or network communications. The overall security risk is negligible.",
