      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration script with no malicious behavior. The only security concern is the use of hardcoded default database credentials ('sysdba' / 'masterkey'), which should be replaced with environment variables or secure secrets for production. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content, indicating a benign but insecure default setup."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing environment detection, logging setup, and internal class method modifications for performance. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The current scores are appropriate; a risk score of approximately 0.1-0.2 accurately reflects the minor dynamic modifications without indicating security threats."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign pytest configuration script that conditionally skips tests based on environment dependencies. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk are all 0, with high confidence in this assessment."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured string formatting and rendering module supporting styled text and Greek symbols. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is appropriate, primarily due to reliance on outdated libraries and external dependencies, but these do not pose active security threats."
