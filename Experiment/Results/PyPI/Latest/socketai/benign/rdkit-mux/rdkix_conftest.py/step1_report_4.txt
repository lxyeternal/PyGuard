  "purpose": "Configure pytest test collection behavior based on environment and available modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements and try-except blocks for modules and conditional extensions.",
  "sinks": "Modifications to the 'collect_ignore' and 'collect_ignore_glob' lists, affecting pytest's test collection process.",
  "flows": "Import attempts -> conditional extension of ignore lists based on module availability.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code; conditional import handling is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally modifies pytest collection ignores based on the presence of modules such as 'win32com', 'rdkix.Avalon.pyAvalonTools', 'inchi', and 'IPython'. It uses try-except blocks to check for module availability and adjusts the ignore lists accordingly. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, malicious code, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward, aimed at environment-specific configuration without executing any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign configuration for pytest with environment checks and dynamic ignore list management. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
