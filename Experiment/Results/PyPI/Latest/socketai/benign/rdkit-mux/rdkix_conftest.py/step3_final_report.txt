{
  "purpose": "This code configures pytest test collection behavior based on environment dependencies by conditionally ignoring certain test files if specific modules are missing.",
  "sources": "Import statements within try-except blocks that check for module availability (win32com, rdkix.Avalon.pyAvalonTools, rdkix.Chem.inchi, IPython).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Attempted imports (sources) determine whether ignore lists are extended or modified (sinks), but no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the logic is purely configuration-based.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import optional modules; based on success or failure, it modifies pytest ignore lists to skip tests dependent on missing modules. It uses standard Python constructs without dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling. The logic is straightforward and intended solely for environment-aware test configuration. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behavior is detected. The code's purpose is benign, and the implementation is clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pytest configuration script that conditionally skips tests based on environment dependencies. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk are all 0, with high confidence in this assessment.",
