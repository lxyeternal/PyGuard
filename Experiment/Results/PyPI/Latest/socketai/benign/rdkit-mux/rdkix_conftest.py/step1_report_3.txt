  "purpose": "Configure pytest test collection behavior based on available modules and environment conditions.",
  "sources": "Import statements and conditional module checks that determine which test files or scripts to ignore.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security issues; only environment checks and ignore lists.",
  "flows": "Conditional imports influence the ignore lists for test collection, but no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior detected; the code performs environment checks and configures test ignores.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import optional modules (win32com, rdkix.Avalon.pyAvalonTools, IPython) and adjusts the pytest collection ignore lists accordingly. No data from external sources is processed directly, and no execution of untrusted code occurs. The logic is straightforward, focusing solely on environment-based configuration. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration script that manages test collection ignores based on environment and module availability. It contains no malicious intent or security risks.",
