  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided code and reports:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code performs environment checks via `try-except` import blocks.\n   - Based on import success or failure, it modifies `collect_ignore` and `collect_ignore_glob` lists.\n   - These lists influence pytest's test collection, skipping certain tests if dependencies are missing.\n   - The code uses standard Python constructs, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports uniformly describe the code as a benign, environment-aware pytest configuration script.\n   - They emphasize the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The analysis correctly identifies that the code only modifies ignore lists based on module availability.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or signs of malware are detected.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code clarity.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal to no security risk, which aligns with the code's benign purpose.\n\n4. **Critical Evaluation:**\n   - The code is standard for environment-dependent test configuration.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the reports correctly focus on the code's purpose.\n   - The uniformity and consistency across reports reinforce that there are no overlooked issues.\n\n5. **Final Expert Judgment:**\n   - The code is safe, with no malicious intent.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n   - No modifications needed.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward pytest configuration snippet, adjusting test ignore lists based on environment checks.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behavior is present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence provided.",
