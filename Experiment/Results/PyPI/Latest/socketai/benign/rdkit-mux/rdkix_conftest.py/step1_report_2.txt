  "purpose": "Configure pytest test collection behavior based on available modules and environment conditions",
  "sources": "Import statements and conditional logic checking for module availability and environment configuration",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data processing or output handling present",
  "flows": "Conditional imports and adjustments to the 'collect_ignore' lists based on import success or failure",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected; straightforward environment checks and configuration logic",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically adjusts pytest collection ignore patterns based on the presence or absence of certain modules (win32com, rdkix.Avalon, inchi, IPython). It uses try-except blocks to avoid import errors and modifies ignore lists accordingly. The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or other risky behaviors. The structure is typical for environment-specific test setup and contains no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest configuration snippet with environment-aware adjustments. No malicious or malicious-like behavior detected. It simply manages test collection ignores based on available modules and features.",
