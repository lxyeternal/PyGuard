{
  "purpose": "Set directory paths for various resources relative to the current file or a specified build path.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'RDBASE' (commented out) and the special variable '__file__'.",
  "sinks": "None directly; directory paths are constructed but no data is transmitted or stored externally.",
  "flows": "None, as there is no untrusted data flow or processing of input beyond directory path construction.",
  "anomalies": "Commented out environment variable access; directory paths are hardcoded or derived from __file__, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs directory paths using either a hardcoded path for RDCodeDir or the current file's directory (__file__). The environment variable 'RDBASE' is referenced but commented out, indicating no active reliance on external input for sensitive data. The path manipulations are straightforward and typical for setting resource directories. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply defines resource directories with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard setup code for resource path management, with no evidence of malicious behavior.",
