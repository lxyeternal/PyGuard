  "purpose": "Setup directory paths for resource and project data using __file__ and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'RDBASE' (commented out), using __file__ to determine current directory.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; code constructs paths based on static and environment data without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __file__ which may be undefined in some environments; presence of hardcoded build-specific path in RDCodeDir.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward directory path setup, with no external input, network activity, or obfuscated code. The environment variable 'RDBASE' is commented out, indicating it's not actively used. The hardcoded path in RDCodeDir appears to be specific to a build environment and not malicious. The reliance on __file__ could cause issues in interactive environments but does not constitute malicious behavior. No signs of malicious code, data leaks, or sabotage are present. The minimal risks are associated with environment assumptions, not security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard setup code with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor risks related to environment assumptions are justified and do not indicate malicious activity.",
