  "purpose": "Configuration for environment paths, database connections, and external tools in the RDKix Python project.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (RDBASE, RD_USESQLLITE, RD_MOLVIEWER), imported modules (pyPgSQL, sqlite3, pysqlite2), hardcoded credentials ('sysdba', 'masterkey').",
  "sinks": "Directory path variables, database connection parameters, external visualization tool setting.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence directory paths and database selection; hardcoded credentials are used directly in configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded default database credentials ('sysdba' / 'masterkey'), which are insecure for production use.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration script that sets environment paths, manages database backend selection based on environment variables and module availability, and configures visualization tools. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The main security concern is the use of default credentials, which are insecure if used in production but are common in default configurations. The code relies on environment variables, which could be manipulated, but this is typical for such scripts. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or code injection are detected. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear. The security risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3, primarily due to the default credentials, which should be replaced with secure secrets in deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration script with no malicious behavior. The only security concern is the use of hardcoded default database credentials ('sysdba' / 'masterkey'), which should be replaced with environment variables or secure secrets for production. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content, indicating a benign but insecure default setup.",
