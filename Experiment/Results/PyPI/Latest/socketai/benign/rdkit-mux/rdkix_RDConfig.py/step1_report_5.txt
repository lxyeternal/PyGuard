  "purpose": "Configure environment variables, directory paths, database connections, and visualization tools for the RDKix Python codebase.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('RDBASE', 'RD_USESQLLITE', 'RD_MOLVIEWER'), imports from os, sys, pyPgSQL, sqlite3, pysqlite2, and code reading environment settings.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive environment variables ('RDBASE', 'RDBASE' being set), database connection strings, and environment variables influencing program behavior.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence directory paths and database choice; imports determine database backend; configuration settings influence program behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Use of default credentials ('sysdba' / 'masterkey') is a security concern, but typical for development environments. No suspicious hardcoded secrets beyond default database credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily initializes configuration settings for paths, database connections, and visualization tools. It conditionally imports database modules based on environment variables and availability. The default credentials ('sysdba' / 'masterkey') are insecure but may be placeholders for development. No malicious code, code injection, or obfuscated logic observed. No data exfiltration or backdoors detected. The code relies on environment variables and standard imports, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard configuration module that sets up environment-dependent paths, database connections, and visualization tools. While it includes insecure default database credentials, these are typical placeholders and do not indicate malicious intent. No malware or malicious activity identified.",
