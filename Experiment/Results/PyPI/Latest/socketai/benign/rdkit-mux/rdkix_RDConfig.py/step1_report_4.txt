  "purpose": "Configuration setup for the RDKix Python code, including environment variable management, directory paths, database settings, and visualization tool configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('RDBASE', 'RD_USESQLLITE', 'RD_MOLVIEWER'), os.environ, sys.executable, import statements for pyPgSQL, sqlite3, pysqlite2",
  "sinks": "None identified—no direct output or data leaks, no execution of untrusted input, no external network connections or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence directory paths and database choices; imports determine database modules used based on environment conditions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded credentials ('sysdba' and 'masterkey') in defaultDBUser and defaultDBPassword; environment-based directory configuration is standard; no suspicious code behavior or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets configuration parameters for the application, including environment variable checks, path constructions, database module imports, and visualization tool selection. The hardcoded database credentials are a potential security concern but are common in default configurations. The database selection logic adapts based on environment variables, and the code avoids executing untrusted data or network operations. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior was detected. The code is straightforward and intended for setup purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard configuration code with minimal security risks. The only notable concern is the hardcoded credentials, which could be problematic if exposed, but this is typical for default configurations. No malicious intent or malware detected.",
