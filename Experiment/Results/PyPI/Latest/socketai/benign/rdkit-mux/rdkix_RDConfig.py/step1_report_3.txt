    "Environment variables: 'RDBASE', 'RD_USESQLLITE', 'RD_MOLVIEWER'",
    "os.environ, os.path, sys.executable",

  "flows": [
    "Environment variables 'RDBASE' and 'RD_USESQLLITE' influence database and directory configurations",
    "Import logic depends on presence of modules and environment variables, affecting database choice",
    "Default credentials are hardcoded and could be used for database access",
    "Setting 'RDBASE' in environment leads to path configuration; absence triggers import from rdkix.RDPaths",
    "Visualization preference derived from environment variable 'RD_MOLVIEWER'"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Hardcoded database credentials ('sysdba'/'masterkey') are a security concern",
    "Default credentials are often sensitive and should not be hardcoded in production code",
    "Use of environment variables with potential influence on directory paths and tools, which could be exploited if manipulated",
    "No explicit input validation, but no malicious data handling is evident",
    "The code simply sets configuration parameters without executing untrusted code"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets configuration parameters based on environment variables and module availability. It imports database modules conditionally, based on environment settings and module imports. The hardcoded database credentials pose a security risk but do not directly execute malicious actions. The environment variable manipulations and module imports are typical for configuration scripts, with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. There are no network operations, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms present. The code structure is straightforward and intended for setting up the environment.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a configuration script with some insecure defaults (hardcoded credentials) but no malicious intent or behavior detected. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior but should avoid hardcoded secrets in production. Overall, the risk is low.",
