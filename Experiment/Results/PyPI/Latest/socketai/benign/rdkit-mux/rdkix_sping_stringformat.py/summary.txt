  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured string formatting and rendering module supporting styled text and Greek symbols. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is appropriate, primarily due to reliance on outdated libraries and external dependencies, but these do not pose active security threats."
