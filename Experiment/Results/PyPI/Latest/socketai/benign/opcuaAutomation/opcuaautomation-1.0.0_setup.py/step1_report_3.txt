{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'opcuaAutomation'.",
  "sources": "The code reads package dependencies from the 'install_requires' list, the README.md file for the long description, and metadata such as author, URL, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks indicating malicious data leakage or harmful actions are present; no untrusted data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "The setup process reads static configuration data; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements are present. The URL points to a GitHub repository, but this alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging using setuptools. It specifies package info, dependencies, metadata, and package data. All dependencies are explicitly listed, and the code reads a README file for the description. No user input, network calls, or executable code is present. The dependencies include common scientific and utility libraries, with versions specified. The URL points to a GitHub repository, but no suspicious or malicious content is evident in this setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. No malware, obfuscated code, or malicious intents are detected. The code appears safe.",
