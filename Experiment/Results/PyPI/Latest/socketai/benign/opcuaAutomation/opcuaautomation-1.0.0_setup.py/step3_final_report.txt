  "purpose": "A standard Python package setup script defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, dependencies, and README file; no untrusted input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to potential data leaks or security effects identified.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static configuration data used for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'numpy==2.2.4' dependency, which does not exist; likely a typo or placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools, with no malicious code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious behaviors. The only anomaly is the invalid dependency version 'numpy==2.2.4', which would cause installation issues but does not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or data leaks are present. The dependency typo is a technical issue rather than a security concern. The malware score is correctly 0, as no malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting straightforward code. The security risk score is minimal (~0.1), primarily due to the dependency version typo, which is a minor technical problem.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The only notable issue is the invalid dependency version, which should be corrected to prevent installation errors. Overall, the package is safe, and the risk is negligible.",
