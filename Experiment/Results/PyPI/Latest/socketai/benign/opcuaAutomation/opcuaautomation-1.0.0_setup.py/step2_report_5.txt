  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script using `setuptools` to configure a Python package.\n- It reads package metadata, dependencies, and the README for the long description.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, or network operations are present.\n- Dependencies are explicitly listed with fixed versions, though some versions (e.g., `numpy==2.2.4`) are invalid or suspicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The URL points to a GitHub repository, but this alone isn't suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Invalid dependency version (`numpy==2.2.4`)**: As of current knowledge, `numpy` does not have a version `2.2.4`. This appears to be a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n### Malicious Behavior:\n- **Malware score**: All reports assign a score of 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- **Flow and sink analysis**: No untrusted data, dynamic code, or network activity.\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning issues:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent.\n- The only technical concern is the invalid dependency version, which is a technical issue, not a security threat.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- The malware scores are consistent and justified at 0.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.1), reflecting minimal concern mainly due to the dependency typo.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Adjust the risk score** slightly higher if the invalid dependency could cause supply chain issues, but not necessarily security risk.\n- **Update the dependency version** to a valid one to prevent installation errors.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score**: Given the typo, a small increase to 0.2-0.3 might be reasonable, but not higher unless the typo masks malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, legitimate setup script with no signs of malicious behavior. The only concern is the invalid dependency version, which is likely a typo or placeholder. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code present.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0.2 (to reflect the dependency typo issue, but not a security threat)\n\n**Conclusion:** The package appears safe; the main action should be correcting the dependency version to ensure proper installation.",
