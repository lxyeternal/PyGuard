{
  "purpose": "This code implements a standard OPC UA client for connecting to a server, reading, and writing node values with configurable parameters and logging.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters, node identifiers (namespace and id), external libraries (opcua, resultsObjects, uaDataType).",
  "sinks": "Network connection attempts, node value read/write operations, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Parameters (URL, node IDs) are used to establish connection and perform read/write; data flows from external inputs to network operations and logs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward OPC UA client with connection management, read/write functions, and configurable logging. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation are present. Exception handling and parameter usage are standard. The logging level can be set dynamically, which is typical but could be misused if parameters are externally controlled; however, this does not constitute malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are found. The code relies on well-known libraries and performs expected operations without suspicious network activity or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard OPC UA client implementation with no malicious or suspicious features. It poses minimal security risk, with scores appropriately set at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1. No adjustments are necessary.",
