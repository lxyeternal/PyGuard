{
  "purpose": "The code implements an OPC UA client for connecting to, reading from, and writing to an OPC UA server, with configurable parameters and logging.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: p_URL, p_retry_attempts, p_retry_delay, p_log_level; Data reads from OPC UA nodes via get_node and get_value methods.",
  "sinks": "Data writes to OPC UA nodes via set_value; logs generated during connection, read, write, disconnect, and errors; exceptions raised during network or node operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used during initialization and configuration; connect() attempts to establish connection; read_value() retrieves data from nodes; write_value() sends data to nodes; disconnect() closes connection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious domain connections; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution; logging level can be set but no malicious use evident; exception handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical OPC UA client implementation with connection handling, read/write functionalities, and logging. It uses external libraries (opcua, resultsObjects, uaDataType) in a standard way. No unusual or malicious behavior detected. The exception handling and data operations seem legitimate. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. Logging configuration allows level adjustment, but this is standard practice. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or malicious logic identified. The code appears focused solely on OPC UA client operations with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard OPC UA client implementation with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected functions for connecting, reading, and writing to a server, with configurable logging and retry mechanisms. No malicious or suspicious activities detected.",
