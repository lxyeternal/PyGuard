  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The function `getVariantType` maps Python types (`bool`, `int`, `float`, `str`) to OPC UA variant types.\n- Raises a `ValueError` for unsupported types.\n- No external interactions, no obfuscation, no malicious code, and no suspicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. The code is straightforward and correctly maps types. No issues or vulnerabilities are apparent.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  The reports uniformly agree that the code is simple, safe, and standard. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue?**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which seem appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  No. All are 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n\n- **Malware score considerations?**  \n  All reports correctly assign malware score 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports base their assessments on observable code behavior, which is safe.\n\n- **Consistency of scores?**  \n  Yes. All are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Is there any hidden or obfuscated malicious activity?**  \n  No. The code is a utility function with no network, file, or environment interactions.\n\n- **Any security risks?**  \n  No. The code performs type mapping only.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  No. The only potential issue is passing unsupported types, which raises an exception. This is a deliberate design choice, not a vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the code and the reports, **the overall scores should be:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is a simple, well-defined utility function with no external dependencies, no network activity, no suspicious patterns, and no malicious payloads. The type checks are standard, and error handling is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- No modifications needed; the scores are appropriate.\n- The code poses no security threat.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the observed code behavior and the analysis provided.",
