  "purpose": "Determine the OPC UA variant type of a given value based on its data type.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'value' in the getVariantType function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing the OPC UA variant type; no untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' flows through isinstance checks to determine variant type, then returns corresponding ua.VariantType.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function to map Python data types (bool, int, float, str) to corresponding OPC UA variant types. It uses straightforward isinstance checks and raises a ValueError for unsupported types. No external data sources, network communication, or hidden behaviors are present. The code appears to be a basic utility function without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function for OPC UA data type mapping with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a simple, well-defined task without external data dependencies or suspicious operations.",
