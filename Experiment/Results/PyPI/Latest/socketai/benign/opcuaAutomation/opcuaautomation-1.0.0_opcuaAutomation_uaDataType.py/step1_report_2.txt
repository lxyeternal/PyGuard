  "purpose": "Determine the OPC UA variant type of a given value based on its Python data type.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'value' to the getVariantType function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing ua.VariantType; no external sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' is checked for its type; based on type, a corresponding ua.VariantType is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward and uses standard library and package functions.",
  "analysis": "The function categorizes input data into OPC UA variant types using isinstance checks. It supports bool, int, float, and str. If an unsupported type is passed, it raises a ValueError. The code appears to be a simple utility function without any side effects or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious code is present. The code depends on the 'opcua' library, but library usage alone is not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function for type mapping in OPC UA communication, with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
