  "purpose": "Map Python basic types (bool, int, float, str) to OPC UA variant types for use in OPC UA communication.",
  "sources": "The function reads the input parameter 'value' and checks its type.",
  "sinks": "The function raises an exception for unsupported types; no data sinks or external outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' is checked against type conditions; supported types return a variant type; unsupported types trigger an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with explicit type checks and exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple type mapping with no external interactions, network activity, or data leaks. It only raises an exception for unsupported types, which is a standard practice. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The logic is clear, and the security implications are minimal. The code's benign nature is consistent with the absence of external effects or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility function for type mapping in OPC UA applications. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
