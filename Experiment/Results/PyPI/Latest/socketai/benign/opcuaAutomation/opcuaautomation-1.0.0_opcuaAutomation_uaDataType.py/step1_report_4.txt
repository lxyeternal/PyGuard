{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to determine the OPC UA variant type of a given value based on its Python data type.",
  "sources": "The function reads input via the 'value' parameter passed to getVariantType().",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data into system-level effects or data leaks are present; the function only maps types.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' is checked for its type, and the corresponding OPC UA variant type is returned; no external data flows or manipulations are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are present. The code uses standard Python type checks and straightforward mapping.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a library for OPC UA interactions, defines a function to determine variant types, supports common data types, and raises an error for unsupported types. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It appears to be a utility function for data type mapping, with no external data access or insecure practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate utility function for OPC UA data type mapping with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
