  "purpose": "Provides a utility function to determine the OPC UA variant type based on the input value.",
  "sources": "The function reads the 'value' argument passed to getVariantType.",
  "markets": "No external untrusted input sources are explicitly used; function operates on provided argument.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' is checked for its type, returning a corresponding ua.VariantType; no external data flow or output leak.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function that maps Python data types to OPC UA variant types. It uses standard type checks and raises an exception if an unsupported type is provided. There are no external network calls, data leaks, or security-critical operations. The code appears to be a straightforward utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic utility function without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe, with no malicious payloads or vulnerabilities detected.",
