{
  "purpose": "The code defines a utility function to determine the OPC UA variant type based on the Python value type, supporting bool, int, float, and str.",
  "sources": "Input to the getVariantType function: the 'value' parameter passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "The return statement outputs the OPC UA variant type; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' is checked for its type, then mapped to a corresponding ua.VariantType; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources beyond this function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. The function is straightforward and type-safe. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific module 'ua' from 'opcua' and defines a function to determine the OPC UA variant type based on the Python data type. It handles bool, int, float, and str explicitly and raises an error for unsupported types. The logic is simple, with no evident malicious activity, data leakage, or security risks. The code appears to be a utility function for type mapping, common in OPC UA client implementations. No external network, file, or environment variable interactions are present, and no malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility function for OPC UA variant type mapping, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a type checker and mapper, with safe and standard practices.",
