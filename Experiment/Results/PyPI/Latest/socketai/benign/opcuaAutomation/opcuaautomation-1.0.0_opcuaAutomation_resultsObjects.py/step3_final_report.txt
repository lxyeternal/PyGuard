  "purpose": "Data container classes for OPC UA connection, read, and write results, used to encapsulate operation outcomes.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters initializing class attributes (p_success, p_error, p_value, p_node_type).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Initialization of class attributes from optional parameters; no data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward with standard class definitions; minor docstring typos are superficial.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple classes with constructors assigning optional parameters to attributes. No external input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The classes serve as data structures for OPC UA operation results. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and purpose indicate a benign nature. The reports correctly identify the lack of malicious behavior, assigning malware score 0, security risk 0, and high confidence. Minor docstring typos do not impact security. Overall, the code is safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of benign, straightforward data container classes with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
