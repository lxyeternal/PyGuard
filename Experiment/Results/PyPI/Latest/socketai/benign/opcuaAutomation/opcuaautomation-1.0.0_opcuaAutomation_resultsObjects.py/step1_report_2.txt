  "purpose": "Define classes to represent the results of OPC UA connection, read, and write operations.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; classes only store provided parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions with initializers that assign parameters to object attributes. It lacks external data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No potential for code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior is observed. The code appears to be simple data structures used for representing OPC UA operation results.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions purely as data containers for OPC UA operation results.",
