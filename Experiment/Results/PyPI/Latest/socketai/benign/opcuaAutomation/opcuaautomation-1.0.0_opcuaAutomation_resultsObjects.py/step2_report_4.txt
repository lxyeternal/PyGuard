  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Each Report:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of simple data container classes for OPC UA operation results.\n- They note no external input handling, no data processing, no network communication, or suspicious behaviors.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, considering the code benign and straightforward.\n\n**Step-by-step evaluation:**\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The code is purely class definitions with initializers, serving as data structures.\n   - No issues are present; the code appears correct and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n   - Minor documentation issues: some parameter descriptions refer to \"reading\" or \"reading\" instead of \"writing\" or \"connection,\" but these are superficial and do not impact security.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned by reports:**\n   - All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely data containers with no external input, processing, or network activity, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unjustified.\n   - All reports correctly assign a risk of 0.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - No malicious activity or code is present.\n   - No signs of backdoors, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - No such claims are made; all analyses are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is entirely benign, serving as straightforward data containers for OPC UA operation results. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0              |\n| Security Risk    | 0              |\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for future changes or integrations, but based on the current code, it is safe.",
