{
  "purpose": "Define result classes for OPC UA connection, read, and write operations to encapsulate their outcomes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to class constructors (__init__ methods).",
  "sinks": "None present; code does not process untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters to object attributes; no external or untrusted data flows evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; docstrings are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple data container classes for OPC UA operation results, with no external data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. It appears to be standard, boilerplate code for structured result encapsulation. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as data structures for OPC UA operation results. It does not contain malware or security risks and appears safe for use.",
