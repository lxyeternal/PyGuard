  "purpose": "Defines result classes for OPC UA connection, read, and write operations to encapsulate success states, errors, and values.",
  "sources": "No input reading or external data sources; only class initializers with optional parameters.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; no output or external communication within this code.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of classes with optional parameters; no data flow involving untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of simple data container classes with constructors setting attributes from optional parameters. There is no external input handling, no data processing, no network communication, and no security-sensitive operations. The use of docstrings clarifies purpose but does not suggest malicious intent. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as data structures for OPC UA operation results. It appears safe and standard.",
