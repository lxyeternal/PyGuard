  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code consists solely of simple data container classes with no external input handling, no network communication, and no malicious behavior.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The purpose is to encapsulate OPC UA operation results, serving as data structures.\n\n**Assessment of the code and reports:**\n- The classes are basic, with constructors setting attributes from optional parameters.\n- There are no dynamic behaviors, no code execution, and no external data processing.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent is present.\n- The reports are consistent in their evaluation, assigning a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0.\n\n**Potential issues or points of concern:**\n- The only minor point is a typo in the docstrings: \"readed\" instead of \"read\" and \"succes\" instead of \"success.\" However, these are trivial and do not impact security.\n- The class design is standard and does not pose any security risks.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- Risk: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate; the code is benign.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- No changes needed.\n- The code is safe, and the reports correctly identify it as such.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
