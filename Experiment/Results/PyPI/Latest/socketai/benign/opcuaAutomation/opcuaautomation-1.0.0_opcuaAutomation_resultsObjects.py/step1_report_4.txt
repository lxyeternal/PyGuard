{
  "purpose": "Define classes representing the results of OPC UA connection, read, and write operations.",
  "sources": "No input sources; classes only initialize with provided parameters.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data processing involving untrusted input; class attributes are simple data holders.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; classes store provided parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. Documentation is standard, and class structures are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three classes for encapsulating OPC UA operation results, with constructors initializing attributes. No external input handling, data processing, or network interactions. No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. The code appears to be simple data container classes without any side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as data structures for OPC UA operation results. No malicious intent or security issues detected.",
