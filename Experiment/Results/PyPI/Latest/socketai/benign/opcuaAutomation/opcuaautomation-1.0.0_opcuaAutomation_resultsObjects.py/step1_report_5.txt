{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for representing results of OPC UA connection, read, and write operations.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes with parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be straightforward class definitions with no suspicious logic or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides three classes for encapsulating the outcome of OPC UA operations, with clear constructors and docstrings. There are no input/output operations, no data handling, and no external interactions or data processing. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and purely structural, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as data containers for OPC UA operation results.",
