  "sources": "The 'run' method in CustomInstallCommand executes an os.system call.",
  "sinks": "os.system(\"touch /tmp/ran\") - executes a shell command that creates a file.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method executes a system command to create a file at /tmp/ran.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system with a simple shell command is suspicious but not necessarily malicious; it may be used for setup or testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, when invoked, runs a shell command to create a file /tmp/ran. The use of os.system here is a potential security concern if the command is constructed dynamically or based on untrusted input, but in this static form, it simply creates a file. There are no hardcoded credentials, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors observed. The command appears to be benign, possibly for testing or marker purposes, but its presence is unusual in a setup script. No other suspicious code or obfuscated logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes a harmless shell command during installation to create a temporary file. No malicious intent is evident, though the use of os.system in setup scripts can be suspicious if used maliciously. Overall, this appears to be a benign setup override, with minimal security risk.",
