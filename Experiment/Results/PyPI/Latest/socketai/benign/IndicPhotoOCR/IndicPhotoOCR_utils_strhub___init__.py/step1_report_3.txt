  "purpose": "Commented-out import statements, likely intended to include modules for data handling and model loading.",
  "sources": "The commented-out lines suggest potential sources for data input (`data.module`) and checkpoint loading (`model.utils`).",
  "sinks": "No active code; if uncommented, potential sinks include functions that load data or models which could be misused if the modules are malicious.",
  "flows": "N/A — no active code execution or data flow occurs in the comments.",
  "anomalies": "The code is entirely commented out; no active code, secrets, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet contains only commented import statements, which do not execute or perform any actions. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows, and no suspicious or malicious behavior detectable in the commented lines. Since they are comments, they pose no security risk or malware concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is inactive and consists solely of commented-out import statements. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
