  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The code is entirely commented out; no active code or data flow.\n- No signs of malicious activity or security issues.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same as above: only commented import statements.\n- No active code or malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, only commented import lines.\n- No executable code or suspicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Commented import statements for data and model utilities.\n- No active code or data flow.\n- No malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Commented import statements for modules related to data handling and checkpoint loading.\n- No active code or data flow.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports involve only commented-out import statements.\n- No executable code, data flows, or suspicious behavior.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** 0; no security risks identified.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The comments might be placeholders or remnants of incomplete code, but they do not pose any security threat.\n- The scores assigned in each report seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as inactive and benign. No changes to scores are necessary. The overall risk remains minimal, with no malware or obfuscation concerns.",
