{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to import specific modules or classes related to data handling and model utilities, likely for machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'data.module' and 'model.utils' modules, which may read data or configuration files during import or execution.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the provided code snippet; it only contains commented import statements.",
  "flows": "No active data flow or execution occurs in the commented code; if uncommented, data could flow from imported modules to subsequent code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is entirely commented out, indicating inactive or placeholder code. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two import statements, both commented out. These suggest that the code's purpose is to load data modules and utility functions but currently does nothing. Since the code is inactive, it cannot perform any malicious actions. No suspicious or malicious code is evident in the commented lines. The presence of import statements in itself is normal and not suspicious. No obfuscation or malicious intent can be inferred from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is inactive due to comments and contains only benign import statements related to data and model utilities. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
