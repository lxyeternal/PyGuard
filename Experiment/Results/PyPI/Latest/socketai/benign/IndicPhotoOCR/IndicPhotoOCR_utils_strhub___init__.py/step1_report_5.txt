{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import specific modules or classes related to data handling and model checkpoint loading, likely for a machine learning or deep learning application.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'SceneTextDataModule' from 'data.module' and 'load_from_checkpoint' from 'model.utils'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are observable in this snippet, as it only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code is commented out; no executable code or logic is present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs are visible.",
  "analysis": "The snippet consists solely of commented-out import statements, which do not execute or perform any operations. The imported modules suggest typical ML workflow components. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or unusual behavior. The comments could be placeholders or reminders for future implementation but do not pose security risks in their current form.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet contains only commented import statements with no active code, data flow, or suspicious behavior. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risk in this fragment.",
