  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The code is entirely commented out; no active code or data flows.\n- No anomalies or suspicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0, which is appropriate.\n- Risk score: 0, since no active code or potential vulnerabilities.\n- Confidence: 1 (high, given the clear inactive state).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1: only commented-out import statements.\n- No active code, data flows, or anomalies.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n- Confidence: 0.8, slightly less due to the potential that uncommented code could be added later, but currently inactive.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: commented-out import statements, no active code.\n- No anomalies or suspicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, only commented import statements, no execution.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as others: commented-out import statements.\n- No active code or data flows.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Justification:\n\n- **Code Presence:** All reports contain only commented-out import statements. No executable code, data processing, or logic.\n- **Malware Risk:** Since no code is active, there is no indication of malicious activity. Malware score should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation is present; all code is plain comments.\n- **Security Risk:** Given the inactivity, no security risks are evident. The risk score should be 0.\n- **Potential for Future Risks:** While the commented lines reference modules that could perform data or model loading, their current inactive state poses no immediate threat.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 for all reports.\n\n**Overall,** the reports are consistent, and the scores align with the inactive, benign nature of the code snippets.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis reflects the fact that there is no active malicious or suspicious activity in the provided code snippets.",
