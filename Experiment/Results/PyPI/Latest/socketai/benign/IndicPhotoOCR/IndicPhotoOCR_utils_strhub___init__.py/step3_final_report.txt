{
  "purpose": "The code contains only commented-out import statements, indicating inactive code snippets with no executable logic or data flows.",
  "sources": "Commented import lines referencing data modules and model utilities.",
  "sinks": "No data or untrusted input flows present; no sinks are active.",
  "flows": "No active source-to-sink data flows, as all code is commented out.",
  "anomalies": "All code lines are comments; no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippets are entirely commented out, with no executable code, data processing, or logic. The comments reference modules related to data handling and model loading, but as they are inactive, they pose no security or malicious risk. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, and confidence is high due to the inactivity and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are inactive, benign, and pose no security threat. The current scores are accurate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
