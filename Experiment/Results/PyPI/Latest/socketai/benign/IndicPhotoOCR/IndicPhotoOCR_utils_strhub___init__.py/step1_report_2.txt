  "purpose": "The code appears to be intended for importing modules related to data handling and model utilities, possibly for machine learning or data processing workflows.",
  "sources": "Import statements from data.module and model.utils indicating reading of external modules or packages.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable as no execution or data flow occurs in the commented-out import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Both import statements are commented out, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior is visible.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of commented-out import statements, which suggests incomplete or placeholder code. Since no active code or data processing occurs, there are no security concerns or malicious behaviors present. The absence of executable code or data flows indicates a low threat level. The comments themselves do not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is inactive, consisting only of commented import statements with no executable content. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risks based on this fragment.",
