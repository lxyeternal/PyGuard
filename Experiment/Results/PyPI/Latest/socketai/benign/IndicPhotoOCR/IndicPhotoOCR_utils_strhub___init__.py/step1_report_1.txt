  "anomalies": "All code is commented out; no unusual or malicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of commented import statements for potentially relevant modules. There are no executable statements, data processing, or logic present. The comments reference data and model modules, which are typical in machine learning projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden code, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is inactive and contains only commented lines with standard import statements. There is no malicious intent or security risk evident in this fragment.",
