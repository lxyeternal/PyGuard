  "purpose": "Define a data module for scene text recognition tasks, including dataset loading, transformation, and data loader configuration.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as root_dir, train_dir, img_size, charset_train, charset_test, batch_size, num_workers, augment, remove_whitespace, normalize_unicode, min_image_dim, rotation, collate_fn; dataset creation functions build_tree_dataset and LmdbDataset; transform functions and file system paths.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data is being sent over the network, written to files, or executed as code from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Parameters are used to configure dataset and dataloader creation; datasets are instantiated with specific transforms, and data loaders are returned for training, validation, and testing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behavior are present. The code employs standard dataset handling, with optional augmentation and transformations, and safe path concatenation using PurePath.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard PyTorch Lightning data module setup for image-based text recognition tasks. It includes dataset building functions, image transformations, and data loader creation. The get_transform method conditionally imports augmentation functions only if augmentation is enabled, which is typical. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is detected. The usage of third-party libraries is normal for such tasks. All paths and data flow seem benign and confined to local file systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard data handling module for scene text recognition, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It safely manages dataset loading, transformations, and data loader creation without any evident security issues.",
