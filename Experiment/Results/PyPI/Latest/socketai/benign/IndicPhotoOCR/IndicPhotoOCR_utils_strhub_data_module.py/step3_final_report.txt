  "purpose": "This code defines a PyTorch Lightning data module for scene text recognition, managing dataset paths, transformations, and data loaders for training, validation, and testing datasets.",
  "sources": "Filesystem paths for datasets, external dataset functions (`build_tree_dataset`, `LmdbDataset`), and optional augmentation functions (`rand_augment_transform`).",
  "sinks": "Data is loaded from filesystem paths into dataset objects, then passed into DataLoader instances for model training and evaluation.",
  "flows": "Filesystem paths -> Dataset constructors -> DataLoader instances.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Dynamic import of augmentation function is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for dataset handling in a machine learning pipeline. It uses safe path handling with `PurePath`, standard libraries, and typical dataset functions. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The dynamic import for augmentation is guarded and common. The configuration of data loaders follows best practices. The minor security risk score (~0.1) assigned in some reports is justified by filesystem access but does not indicate actual threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No modifications are necessary.",
