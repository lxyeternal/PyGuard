  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data sources such as environment variables, user inputs, or external files; code reading from these sources.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, or other outputs where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs), including any processing or transformations in between.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, unusual code constructs, or any behavior deviating from normal utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is absent or minimal in all reports, with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected. The reports correctly identify the lack of code or benign code, assigning malware scores of 0 and obfuscation scores of 0. The security risk scores are low (around 0.2), justified by potential untrusted data sources but no active threats. Confidence levels are high (0.7 to 0.9) where detailed review is provided. No anomalies or suspicious flows are observed. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the evidence, and no significant issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are appropriate given the absence of malicious code or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified by potential untrusted input handling but do not indicate active threats. The evaluations are consistent, and no adjustments are necessary.",
