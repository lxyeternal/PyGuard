{
  "purpose": "Extend default image augmentation operations to include additional parameters and override existing functions.",
  "sources": "Import from timm.data.auto_augment, functions like rotate, _randomly_negate.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Input images are processed through rotate_expand which calls rotate; parameters are set via _level_to_arg and applied in the augmentation update.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior; the code only updates augmentation mappings, no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard augmentation functions, defines a rotate_expand function to perform image rotation with expand=True, and updates global dictionaries to override and extend augmentation behavior. It uses partial application to set parameters for different augmentation levels. No input validation, no network access, and no suspicious file handling are present. The code's purpose appears solely to modify image augmentation settings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate extension of image augmentation routines, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only modifies internal mappings for image transformations.",
