{
  "purpose": "The code extends default image augmentation operations by updating global mappings with custom functions and parameter calculations, primarily for image rotation and transformation parameters.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'timm.data.auto_augment' and the code itself where functions like 'rotate', '_randomly_negate', and data structures are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network connections, or external data sinks are present; the code only modifies internal global dictionaries.",
  "flows": "The code updates 'NAME_TO_OP' and 'LEVEL_TO_ARG' mappings with new functions and parameter calculations, without external data flow or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration extension for image augmentation, defining a rotated image function with expand=True and updating global operation mappings. It uses standard library functions and safe practices. No external data, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The code's purpose is benign, intended for augmentation pipeline customization. The global state modification via 'update()' is typical for such configuration code. No anomalies or security issues are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply extends augmentation capabilities in a controlled manner. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1—are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
