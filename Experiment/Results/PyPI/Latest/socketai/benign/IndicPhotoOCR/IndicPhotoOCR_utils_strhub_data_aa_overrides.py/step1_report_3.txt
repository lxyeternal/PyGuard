{
  "purpose": "Extends default image augmentation operations to accept optional parameters for scene text recognition preprocessing.",
  "sources": "Imports from functools and timm.data.auto_augment; functions rotate_expand and _level_to_arg that process image parameters and hyperparameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows leading to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Hyperparameter retrieval and manipulation via _level_to_arg; updating operation dictionaries in apply() with no external input dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies image augmentation behavior by updating operation mappings with functions that handle image rotation and parameter scaling. It uses standard library functions and well-known external modules. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is detected. It appears to be a benign utility for scene text recognition preprocessing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard extension for image augmentation, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply updates augmentation parameters for scene text recognition pipelines.",
