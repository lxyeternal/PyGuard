{
  "purpose": "Extend default image augmentation operations to accept optional parameters and update operation mappings for scene text recognition preprocessing.",
  "sources": "Import statements from functools and timm.data.auto_augment; functions rotate_expand and _level_to_arg; update calls to NAME_TO_OP and LEVEL_TO_ARG.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The code modifies global mappings for augmentation operations without processing untrusted external data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code primarily updates dictionaries with augmentation functions and parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and functions, defines a wrapper for rotating images with expand, and a helper to convert levels to arguments with random negation. It updates global mappings to include these functions for augmentation purposes. No user input, network operations, or sensitive data handling is present. The code appears to be part of a standard augmentation setup for machine learning training, with no suspicious activity or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard image augmentation setup with no indications of malicious or malicious intent. It only modifies global operation mappings for data augmentation and does not handle any untrusted data or perform any harmful actions.",
