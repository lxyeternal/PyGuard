{
  "purpose": "The code extends default image augmentation operations for scene text recognition, primarily modifying parameters for rotation and other transformations.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters from the 'hparams' dictionary and updates the operation mappings using the 'update' method.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to use untrusted data sources directly; it manipulates image transformation parameters locally.",
  "flows": "Parameters from 'hparams' influence the '_level_to_arg' function, which calculates transformation levels used in image augmentation operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code primarily updates operation mappings for image transformations. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific functions for image augmentation and defines a custom rotate function with expand=True. It then defines a helper to convert levels to arguments, scaling based on provided hyperparameters and randomly negating the transformation levels. The 'apply' function updates global mappings with these custom operations. The code appears to serve as an extension for augmentation purposes, with no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. There are no external data transmissions, backdoors, or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension to an image augmentation library, enabling additional transformations with configurable parameters. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
