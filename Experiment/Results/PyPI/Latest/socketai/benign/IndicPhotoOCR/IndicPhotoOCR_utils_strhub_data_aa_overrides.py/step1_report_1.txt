{
  "purpose": "Extend default image augmentation operations with optional parameters, specifically modifying rotation behavior and updating augmentation parameters.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'functools' and 'timm.data.auto_augment'; functions 'rotate_expand', '_level_to_arg', and 'apply' which modify global dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Potentially affected functions are 'rotate' from 'timm.data.auto_augment' and the dictionaries 'NAME_TO_OP' and 'LEVEL_TO_ARG', which could influence augmentation behavior.",
  "flows": "The 'apply' function updates global mappings that control augmentation operations based on parameters. No untrusted input is processed directly; the code merely updates configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code performs standard configuration updates.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a function to perform rotation with expanded image boundaries. It includes a helper to compute augmentation parameters based on input levels and hyperparameters, utilizing partial functions. The 'apply' function updates global augmentation mappings, allowing configurable transformations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a typical extension of augmentation pipelines without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code solely manages image augmentation parameters and updates configuration mappings for data augmentation in a typical machine learning pipeline. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It is a benign configuration extension for image transformations.",
