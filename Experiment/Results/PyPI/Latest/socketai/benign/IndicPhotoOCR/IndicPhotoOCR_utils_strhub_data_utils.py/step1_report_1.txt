{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and methods for scene text recognition, including tokenization and charset transformation, to process and encode text labels for a machine learning model.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input labels provided to the encode methods, and regex patterns for charset filtering.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any evident sinks that send data over networks, write to files, or leak data. No external system calls or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Input labels are transformed via charset filtering and encoded into tensors; these tensors are then processed by decoding functions. No external untrusted data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. All operations are standard for text tokenization and encoding.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard tokenization, charset filtering, and encoding/decoding for text labels used in OCR models. It includes regex-based character filtering, tensor padding, and sequence filtering. There are no suspicious external calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of regex and tensor operations is straightforward and consistent with common NLP preprocessing techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of tokenizers and charset handlers for OCR models without malicious intent. It does not include any malicious behaviors, suspicious network activity, or security risks.",
