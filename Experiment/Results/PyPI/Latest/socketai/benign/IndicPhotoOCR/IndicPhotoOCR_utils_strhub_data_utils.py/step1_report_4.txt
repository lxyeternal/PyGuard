{
  "purpose": "Provides text processing and tokenization utilities for scene text recognition models, including encoding and decoding sequences.",
  "sources": "Reads input labels (strings), processes token distributions, and creates tensors for model training and inference.",
  "sinks": "Decodes model outputs, filters token IDs; no evident direct data leaks or unsafe data handling.",
  "flows": "Input labels -> encoding to tensors; model output tensors -> decoding to strings; filtering in decode method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of regex and token filtering appear standard. No malicious network or system calls observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements character set transformations, tokenization, and decoding logic for OCR tasks. It relies solely on standard Python and PyTorch libraries, with no network access, no system commands, and no obfuscated code. No signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or sabotage are present. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns, and no anomalies suggestive of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, standard for OCR tokenization and decoding purposes, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
