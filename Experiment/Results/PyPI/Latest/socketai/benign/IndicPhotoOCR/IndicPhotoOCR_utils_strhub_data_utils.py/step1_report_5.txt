{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes for text encoding and decoding, specifically for scene text recognition models, including charset transformations and tokenization.",
  "sources": "Input labels for encoding (labels parameter in encode methods), and model output token distributions (token_dists in decode method).",
  "sinks": "Decoded text outputs; no direct untrusted data sink appears to be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "flows": "Labels are transformed via CharsetAdapter and Tokenizer classes, then encoded into tensors. Model outputs (probabilities) are decoded back into text sequences.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of regular expressions for character filtering is standard. No obfuscated code or malicious network activities detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines text processing classes with standard methods for encoding, filtering, and decoding sequences. The classes use PyTorch tensors for batch processing. No input/output operations involve external or untrusted sources other than typical model inputs/outputs. The filtering methods handle sequence termination (EOS) and blank tokens appropriately. No suspicious or malicious logic, such as data exfiltration, network connections, or privilege escalation, is found.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard implementation for scene text recognition, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly handles data transformations within the scope of a machine learning pipeline.",
