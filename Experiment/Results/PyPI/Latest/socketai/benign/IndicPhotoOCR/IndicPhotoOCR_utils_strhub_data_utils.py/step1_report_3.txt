{
  "purpose": "The code implements character set adaptation, tokenization, and encoding/decoding for scene text recognition models.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries (re, abc, itertools, typing) and PyTorch modules; no external or untrusted sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not perform network, file, or system modifications; it processes input data for models.",
  "flows": "Input labels are processed through encoding functions; character filters are applied; decoded outputs are generated from model predictions. No untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior, are detected. The code adheres to standard practices for text tokenization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for charset transformation and tokenization, with methods for encoding, decoding, and filtering tokens. It employs regular expressions, standard Python data structures, and PyTorch tensor operations without executing external commands or network calls. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations are present. The logic is straightforward, and the structure follows typical NLP tokenization patterns. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or potential exploits.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of tokenization and charset filtering for a scene text recognition model, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It operates solely on input data to prepare model inputs and outputs.",
