{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes for text encoding, decoding, and preprocessing used in scene text recognition models.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as 're', 'torch', and 'torch.nn.utils.rnn', and defines functions and classes for label transformation, tokenization, and encoding.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands are present that could be exploited for data leaks or malicious activities.",
  "flows": "Input labels are processed through CharsetAdapter and tokenizers, encoded into tensors, and decoded back into text; no external or untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated logic are evident. The code is standard for a text recognition preprocessing pipeline.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of charset adaptation, tokenization, and encoding/decoding for text recognition tasks. It uses well-known libraries like 'torch' and 're'. There are no indications of malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No suspicious behaviors or backdoors are detected. The code appears focused on data transformation without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical text preprocessing module for scene text recognition models, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe for use, assuming the dependencies are secure and unmodified.",
