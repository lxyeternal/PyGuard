{
  "purpose": "The code implements charset filtering, tokenization, encoding, and decoding for OCR models, facilitating label processing and sequence management.",
  "sources": "Input labels (strings) provided to encode(), regex patterns for charset filtering, and internal data structures for token management.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data flows from labels to tensors and back within the system, with no network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Labels -> charset filtering -> token to ID mapping -> tensor encoding -> tensor decoding -> token reconstruction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries (re, torch) for charset filtering and tokenization. It defines classes for handling character sets, token encoding/decoding, and filtering. No external system calls, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The regex filtering is typical for character validation. The tokenization logic handles special tokens (BOS, EOS, PAD) appropriately. The filtering methods truncate sequences at EOS or remove duplicates and blanks, respectively. Overall, the implementation is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with common OCR preprocessing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of charset filtering and tokenization for OCR tasks. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation (0), and minimal security risk (0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's content.",
