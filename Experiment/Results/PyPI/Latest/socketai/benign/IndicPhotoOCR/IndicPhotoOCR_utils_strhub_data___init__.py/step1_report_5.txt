  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'SceneTextDataModule' from a relative package, likely used for data handling or processing in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The import statement is the only source, which may load code or data from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network operations, file writes, or external system calls are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident from the import statement alone; it merely loads a module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "analysis": "This snippet is a simple import statement, referencing a local module. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or other operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior can be inferred from this single line. Without additional context or code, there are no indicators of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to import a module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this import statement.",
