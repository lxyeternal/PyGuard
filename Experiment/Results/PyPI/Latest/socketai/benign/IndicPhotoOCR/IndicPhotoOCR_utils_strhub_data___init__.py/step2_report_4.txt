  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports concern a single import statement: `from .module import SceneTextDataModule`.\n- Most reports note that the code is benign, straightforward, and involves only a local import.\n- Several reports mention that the import statement is commented out, indicating possible placeholder or incomplete code.\n- No reports identify any actual malicious activity, external data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code snippets are minimal and typical for Python projects.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Presence:\n- **Issue presence:** All reports agree that the code contains only an import statement, with some commented-out. No actual malicious code or data flow is present.\n- **Code correctness:** The import statement appears syntactically correct and standard.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **No flaws detected:** The reports correctly identify that these snippets are benign and standard. There are no assumptions about vulnerabilities or malware that are unsupported.\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation evident.\n- **Risk score:** All are at 0 or very close, reflecting minimal or no security risk.\n\n### Potential Issues or Misjudgments:\n- The repeated mention of commented-out code suggests these are placeholders or incomplete snippets, but this does not imply malicious intent.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all are cautious and accurate.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores seem reasonable and consistent** with the evidence.\n- **No adjustments needed** based on the current data.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n**Additional note:** Given the minimal and benign nature of these snippets, I agree with the provided scores. However, if these snippets are part of a larger codebase, a comprehensive review of the entire project would be necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nBased on all reports and the code snippet, I conclude:\n- The code is benign, standard import statements with no malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- No further action is required.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the current evidence and the nature of the code snippets.",
