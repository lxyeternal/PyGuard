  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code snippets.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports involve a simple import statement of `SceneTextDataModule` from a local module.\n- The code snippets are either active import statements or commented-out lines.\n- No data flows, external data sources, or sinks are involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious activity are present.\n- The reports consistently conclude benign intent, which aligns with the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code presence and correctness:\n\n**Original code:**\n```python\n# from .module import SceneTextDataModule\n```\n- This is a commented-out import statement.\n- The actual active code is absent; only a comment exists.\n- The import syntax appears correct if uncommented, assuming the local module `module` exists and contains `SceneTextDataModule`.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is syntactically valid if uncommented.\n- As it stands, it does nothing; no runtime activity occurs.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Import class/function.  \n- Findings: No suspicious activity; benign.  \n- Confidence: 1  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above, but the line is commented out.  \n- Findings: No active code, no malicious intent.  \n- Confidence: 1  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Similar analysis; standard import statement.  \n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n- Confidence: 1.0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Commented-out import, possibly placeholder.  \n- No active code or data flow.  \n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) due to the commented line, but still benign.  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Similar to others; import from local module.  \n- No suspicious activity.  \n- Confidence: 1  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking scores:\n\n- All reports correctly assign malware scores of 0, reflecting no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n- Security risk scores are 0, appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Confidence levels are high, given the simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code is a simple import statement, which is syntactically correct if uncommented.\n- **Malware potential:** None detected; all scores align.\n- **Obfuscation:** Absent.\n- **Risk level:** No security risk evident.\n\n**However,** since the code is only a commented import, it does not execute or pose any risk in its current state. If uncommented, it would be a standard import with no issues.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (benign import statement)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their benign assessment. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No adjustments are necessary.",
