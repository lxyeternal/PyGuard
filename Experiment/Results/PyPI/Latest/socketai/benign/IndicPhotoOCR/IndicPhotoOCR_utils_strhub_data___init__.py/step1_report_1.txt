  "purpose": "Importing a class or function named SceneTextDataModule from a local module",
  "sources": "Import statement at the beginning of the code",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "None; only an import statement without runtime data flow",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code suggests prior or alternative code; no suspicious activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement, which is a standard practice for modular programming in Python. It imports SceneTextDataModule from a local module within the same package. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The import line is straightforward and common in Python projects. No external data sources, user input, or potentially dangerous operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, consisting solely of an import statement. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks based on this minimal code.",
