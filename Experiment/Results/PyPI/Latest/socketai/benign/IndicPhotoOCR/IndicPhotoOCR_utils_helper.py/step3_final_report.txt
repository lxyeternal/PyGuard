  "purpose": "Group recognized texts into lines based on vertical overlap and sort words within each line by their x-coordinate.",
  "sources": "recognized_texts dictionary containing 'txt' and 'bbox' for each recognized word.",
  "sinks": "None; the code processes data internally without external data flows or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input recognized_texts -> calculate_overlap for each pair -> group by overlap threshold -> sort within groups by x-coordinate.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward spatial grouping with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The function defines a helper to compute normalized vertical overlap between bounding boxes. It iterates through recognized texts, grouping them into lines if their vertical overlap exceeds 0.4. Within each line, words are sorted by their x-coordinate. The commented-out code block is complex but inactive, serving as an earlier or alternative implementation. The active code performs standard OCR post-processing without external effects or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard spatial grouping and sorting utility for OCR results. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The commented-out code is inactive and does not impact security. The overall security risk is negligible.",
