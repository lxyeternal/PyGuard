{
  "purpose": "The code implements an OCR pipeline for detecting, identifying script language, and recognizing text in images, primarily for use with Indic scripts.",
  "sources": "Reads image files via file paths, loads models for detection and recognition, reads and writes images using cv2, and creates directories for temporary files.",
  "sinks": "Saves cropped images to disk, saves annotated images with bounding boxes, potentially displays images with plt, and calls external model methods.",
  "flows": "Reads image paths -> detects text regions -> crops regions -> saves cropped images -> identifies script language -> recognizes text -> outputs results.",
  "anomalies": "Uses temporary file creation for cropped images without cleanup (commented out removal), creation of directories for saving images, and potential verbose print statements. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious external network calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard OCR tasks with model inference, image processing, and file I/O. Temporary files are created for cropped images but are not deleted (though cleanup code is commented). Directory creation is handled safely. No evidence of data leakage, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. No suspicious network activity or backdoors. The code relies on external models and processes images securely. No obfuscated or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical OCR pipeline with no malicious intent. It handles image processing and model inference securely, with standard I/O operations. Minor concerns about temporary file cleanup, but overall, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
