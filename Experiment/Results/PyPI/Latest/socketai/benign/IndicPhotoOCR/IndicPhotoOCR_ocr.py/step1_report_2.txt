{
  "purpose": "The code implements an OCR pipeline for detecting, classifying, and recognizing text in images, particularly focusing on scripts and language identification.",
  "sources": "Reads image files (via cv2.imread), reads input paths (via function arguments), reads environment variables indirectly via os and cv2 modules, and temporary saves cropped images to disk.",
  "sinks": "Writes images to disk (cv2.imwrite), creates directories (os.makedirs), potentially displays images (matplotlib, though plt is not imported), and prints debug/info messages.",
  "flows": "Loads image data, detects text regions, crops regions using masks, saves temporary crop images, identifies script language from cropped images, then recognizes text, and finally outputs results.",
  "anomalies": "Uses temporary files for cropped images without explicit cleanup (os.remove is commented out), and directory creation is dynamic, which could be misused if path inputs are manipulated. No hardcoded credentials or secret data are present. No apparent obfuscated code or hidden backdoors. No network connections or data exfiltration evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard OCR tasks with typical use of libraries like cv2, numpy, and deep learning models for script detection and recognition. It creates temporary images for script identification, which could be exploited if an attacker supplies malicious image paths or path manipulations. The lack of cleanup for temporary files and the dynamic directory creation are potential security considerations but do not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or credential leaks are present. The code appears to be a typical OCR implementation with no overt malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard OCR pipeline with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It uses temporary file handling for intermediate steps, which could be misused in a hostile environment but is not inherently malicious. No malware or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
