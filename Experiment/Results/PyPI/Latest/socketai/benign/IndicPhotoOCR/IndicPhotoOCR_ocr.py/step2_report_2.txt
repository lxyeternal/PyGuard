  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard OCR pipeline for Indic scripts.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Reads images, loads models, saves images, possibly displays images.\n- **Anomalies:** Temporary files are created but cleanup is commented out; directories are created safely.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, network activity, or data leakage. The code uses external models and standard image processing. No obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, typical OCR code.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n- Risk: 0.2 (low, minor concern about temp files not cleaned)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on temporary files and directory creation.\n- **Anomalies:** Same temporary file creation without cleanup, no network activity.\n- **Analysis:** Standard OCR pipeline, potential minor concern about temp files but no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 — consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar again, standard OCR with temporary files.\n- **Anomalies:** No cleanup, no network, no secrets.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same pattern, no suspicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Temporary files, no cleanup, no network.\n- **Analysis:** Typical OCR pipeline.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same general structure, no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Anomalies:** Temporary files, no cleanup, no network.\n- **Analysis:** Standard OCR code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero, justified by temporary file handling without cleanup, but overall low.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No modifications needed.\n- The code appears to be a legitimate OCR pipeline with no security concerns beyond minor temporary file handling issues.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (minor concern about temp file cleanup, but not significant)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, safe OCR implementation with appropriate scoring.",
