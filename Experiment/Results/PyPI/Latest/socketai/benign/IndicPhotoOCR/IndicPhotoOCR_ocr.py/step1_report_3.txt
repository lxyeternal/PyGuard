{
  "purpose": "The code implements an OCR pipeline for detecting, segmenting, classifying script, and recognizing text in images, primarily for Indic scripts.",
  "sources": "Reads image files via cv2.imread(), loads models and configuration files, creates directories for temporary storage, and receives image paths as input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Writes temporary cropped images to disk, saves visualized images with cv2.imwrite(), and displays images with plt.show().",
  "flows": "Image paths are read to load images; detections are obtained from models; cropped regions are saved to disk; script identification is performed on these cropped images; recognized text is returned and possibly saved or displayed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. Temporary image files are created and deleted without direct user input. No network communications or system commands are executed. Model files and configuration are imported but not shown to contain malicious code. The code appears to be structured for normal OCR tasks without suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs image processing and model inference for OCR with typical data flow: reading images, detecting text regions, cropping images, identifying scripts, and recognizing text. The creation of temporary image files for intermediate steps is standard. No code executes external commands, network communication, or accesses environment variables. The commented-out sections do not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated or unusual language constructs are detected. The use of models and helper functions appears standard and safe. Overall, the code is consistent with typical OCR pipelines and does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard OCR implementation utilizing third-party models and image processing libraries. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. The temporary file handling is benign and necessary for processing. Overall, the code is safe and intended solely for OCR purposes.",
