{
  "purpose": "The code implements an OCR pipeline for text detection, script identification, and text recognition, primarily for images containing various scripts/languages.",
  "sources": "Reads image files via file paths, loads models for detection, identification, and recognition, and temporarily saves cropped images for processing.",
  "sinks": "Saves temporary cropped images, visualized images, and final output annotations; calls external detection, identification, and recognition models.",
  "flows": "Reads input image -> detects text regions -> crops regions -> saves temporary images -> identifies script -> recognizes text -> compiles results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code uses temporary file saving, but no evident malicious intent. The code structure is straightforward and lacks obfuscated segments or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code conducts OCR tasks using multiple models. It loads models, processes images, and saves temporary cropped images for script identification. Temporary files are saved in a dedicated directory, which could be used maliciously if the directory or filenames are manipulated, but in this context, it appears standard. There are no network calls, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. Commented-out code does not introduce risks. All functions appear to handle data locally without external communication or suspicious activity. The use of 'cv2.imwrite' and temporary file creation could pose a minor risk if user-controlled inputs are passed directly without validation, but in this scenario, input sources are fixed file paths.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate OCR pipeline with no clear malicious or sabotage behavior. It processes images and saves temporary files for script detection and recognition, but does not perform any harmful actions such as data theft, system manipulation, or network communication. The overall risk is minimal.",
