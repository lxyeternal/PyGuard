  "purpose": "OCR pipeline for text detection, script identification, and recognition in Indic scripts.",
  "sources": "Image files read via cv2.imread, temporary cropped images saved with cv2.imwrite, detection results from detector.detect.",
  "sinks": "Detected bounding boxes used for cropping, recognized text stored in output dictionary.",
  "flows": "Image input -> detection -> cropping (via mask and bounding rect) -> script identification -> recognition -> output.",
  "anomalies": "Temporary image files created for script identification are not deleted (cleanup code commented out). Directory creation handled safely.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard OCR tasks with external models. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Temporary files are used for intermediate steps but are not cleaned up, which is a minor operational concern. No malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage patterns are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical OCR workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign OCR pipeline with no malicious intent or obfuscation. Minor temporary file handling issues exist but do not constitute security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
