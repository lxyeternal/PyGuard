{
  "purpose": "The code implements an OCR pipeline for detecting, identifying scripts, and recognizing text in images, utilizing multiple deep learning models and OpenCV for image processing.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from specified paths, loads models (likely from disk), and reads environment variables implicitly through os and cv2 functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses cv2.imwrite to save images, cv2.imread to load images, and potentially creates directories with os.makedirs. Also temporarily writes cropped images to disk for script identification.",
  "flows": "Loads images from disk -> detects text regions -> masks and crops regions -> saves temporary images -> identifies script -> recognizes text -> outputs structured results.",
  "anomalies": "Creates and deletes temporary image files without validation or cleanup, uses hardcoded file paths for temporary storage, and contains commented-out code that suggests incomplete or leftover code segments. No clear malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system damage present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard image processing and deep learning inference for OCR tasks. It reads input images, detects text, crops regions, identifies scripts, and recognizes text using models stored locally. Temporary files are saved but not deleted, which could be a concern for disk space or information leakage. The code does not include any network communication, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code beyond model inference and image I/O. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are observed. The commented-out code and incomplete cleanup procedures are typical of development artifacts rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard OCR processing pipeline with no indications of malicious behavior. It performs expected functions for an OCR system, with no evidence of sabotage, malware, or security risks beyond minor concerns about temporary file management.",
