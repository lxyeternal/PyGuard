  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General observations from the code:**\n\n- The code performs standard OCR tasks: detection, script identification, and recognition.\n- It uses external models loaded via imported modules.\n- Temporary images are created for script identification, saved to disk, but cleanup (os.remove) is commented out.\n- Directory creation is handled safely with os.makedirs.\n- No network calls, external data exfiltration, or hardcoded secrets are evident.\n- No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.\n- Verbose print statements are optional and benign.\n- The code does not execute system commands or access environment variables directly.\n- The overall data flow is straightforward and typical for OCR pipelines.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard OCR pipeline for Indic scripts.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent, standard libraries, no suspicious network activity.\n- **Concerns:** Temporary files are created but cleanup code is commented out.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. The low risk score aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar OCR with script classification.\n- **Analysis:** Same pattern—temporary files, no cleanup, no network activity.\n- **Concerns:** Potential misuse if paths are manipulated, but no actual malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. No issues with the scoring.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** OCR for Indic scripts, detection, segmentation.\n- **Analysis:** Standard image processing, no network, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Concerns:** Temporary files are created without cleanup, but this is typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Valid and consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar OCR pipeline with deep models.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, no network, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Concerns:** Temporary files are created but cleanup is commented out.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** OCR with multiple models.\n- **Analysis:** Same pattern—standard image processing, no malicious activity.\n- **Concerns:** Temporary files, no cleanup, but no actual harm.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Judgment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently rate 0, which aligns with the code's behavior—no malicious code, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk score:** 0.2 is conservative, acknowledging minor concerns about temporary file handling, but nothing serious.\n\n**Important note:** The temporary files are created but not deleted (commented out cleanup). While this is a minor concern, it does not constitute malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — minor concern about temporary file cleanup, but not a security risk per se.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured OCR pipeline with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor issues related to temporary file cleanup are typical in development code but do not indicate security threats.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The scores provided in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.2\n\nThe code appears safe, with only minor concerns about temporary file management that do not elevate the security risk meaningfully.",
