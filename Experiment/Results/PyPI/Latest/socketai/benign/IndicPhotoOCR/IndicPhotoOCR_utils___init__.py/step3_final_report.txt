  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code segments involving environment variables, network connections, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, dynamic eval/exec, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into network or file sinks, potentially via eval/exec or hardcoded secrets.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec'/'eval' with dynamic strings, hardcoded credentials, network connections to suspicious domains, misleading variable names, unnecessary complexity, obfuscation tactics.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits multiple malicious indicators: dynamic code execution with 'exec'/'eval', hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, obfuscation tactics, and misleading variable names. These patterns suggest intentional malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or backdoor access. Other code snippets show benign, well-structured code with no suspicious patterns. The overall assessment assigns high malware (0.75-0.8), obfuscation (0.7), and security risk (0.75-0.8) scores to the suspicious code, justified by the indicators. Benign code receives zero or minimal scores with high confidence. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms malicious indicators in the code with high confidence, warranting elevated malware and security risk scores. Benign code is correctly scored low. The overall assessment aligns with the evidence, emphasizing the need for cautious handling of the suspicious dependency.",
