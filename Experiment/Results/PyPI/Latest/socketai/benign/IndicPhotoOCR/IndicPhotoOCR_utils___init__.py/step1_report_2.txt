  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but the specific intent is unclear due to lack of comments and context.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from environment variables, function arguments, and possibly external modules or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing to console, writing to files, executing commands, or sending data over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs/env vars) through processing functions to sinks (output, network, file).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation detected. No suspicious network calls or data leaks evident.",
  "analysis": "A step-by-step review of the code shows standard Python syntax with typical use of functions and imports. No malicious code or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network attacks are identified. The code does not exhibit obfuscation, dynamic execution, or unusual language features. Overall, the code seems benign, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be legitimate, with standard functionality and no malicious behaviors observed.",
