  "purpose": "Unit and integration testing of CLI commands related to URL processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments (--url, --hello) via the invoke method in the test cases.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command execution in this test code.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are passed to the 'main' function via CLI simulation; no untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs straightforward unit testing without suspicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a unittest framework to test CLI behavior, invoking the 'main' function with various arguments and checking exit codes. It does not process or handle data beyond command-line argument passing. No code injection, network activity, or credential handling is present. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code is clean, standard for unit tests, and limited to testing expected CLI behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test suite for CLI commands and shows no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It only interacts with the CLI interface internally and does not perform any harmful actions.",
