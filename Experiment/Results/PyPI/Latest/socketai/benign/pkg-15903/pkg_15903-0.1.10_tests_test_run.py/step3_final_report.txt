  "purpose": "Unit and integration tests for CLI argument handling in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments passed to main() via CliRunner.invoke()",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data beyond argument passing",
  "flows": "CLI arguments -> main() invocation -> exit code determination",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for testing",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite for a CLI application, invoking main() with various URL options and verifying exit codes. It contains no network activity, data leakage, code injection, or malicious payloads. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The tests only verify argument parsing and exit codes, with no external or sensitive operations involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test suite with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
