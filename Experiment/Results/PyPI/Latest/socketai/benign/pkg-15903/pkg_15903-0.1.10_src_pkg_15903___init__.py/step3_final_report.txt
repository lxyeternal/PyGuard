  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable in a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns a static string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code is a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or unusual code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward assignment of a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packaging. It contains no external data handling, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no malicious code. The code's simplicity and transparency indicate no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. There are no anomalies or suspicious behaviors to consider.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, representing a standard version declaration in Python packages. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
