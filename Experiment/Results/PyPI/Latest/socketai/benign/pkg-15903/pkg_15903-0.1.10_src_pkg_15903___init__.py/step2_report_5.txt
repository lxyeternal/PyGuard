  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is simply assigning a version string to `__version__`. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data flow.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' reasoning:**  \n   The reasoning is consistent and accurate. Each report emphasizes the minimal and benign nature of the code, correctly dismissing any suspicion.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code.\n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. No malicious behavior is evident.\n   - **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports agree that the code is just a version string assignment with no suspicious activity, the overall security risk should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports, reflecting no malicious intent.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a standard version declaration.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (benign, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code snippet is a standard, benign version string assignment with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo changes needed.",
