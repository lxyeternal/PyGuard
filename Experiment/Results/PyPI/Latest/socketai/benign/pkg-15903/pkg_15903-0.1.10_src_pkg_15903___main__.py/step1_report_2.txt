  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing and possibly interacts with external resources, but the exact purpose is unclear due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include input functions, environment variables, or imported modules reading external data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks possibly through intermediate variables or functions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. No suspicious network activity or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, processes data in a straightforward manner, and does not contain malicious patterns such as code execution or data exfiltration. Lack of context prevents definitive conclusions, but no suspicious activity is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, though limited context restricts complete certainty.",
