  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "No concrete sources identified; code is minimal, incomplete, or absent.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no external data flows identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present due to lack of code.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal or obfuscated code with no suspicious patterns; no hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate limited or no code, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. Scores for malware are consistently zero, reflecting no malicious behavior. Obfuscation scores are low (around 0.2) in cases where suspicion exists but no evidence is found. Confidence scores are moderate to high, aligning with the clarity of the assessments. The reasoning across reports is consistent and cautious, appropriately reflecting the limited data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malware or significant security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate given the minimal or absent code. No revisions are necessary; the assessments are justified and aligned with the available information.",
