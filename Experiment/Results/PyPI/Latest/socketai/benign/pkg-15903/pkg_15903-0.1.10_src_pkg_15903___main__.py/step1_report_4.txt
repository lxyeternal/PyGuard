  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or network communication, but without the actual code, this cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include user inputs, environment variables, file reads, or network data streams. Specific sources cannot be identified without the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmissions, file writes, system commands, or data leaks to external servers. Specific sinks cannot be identified without the code.",
  "flows": "Source-to-sink paths would involve untrusted data flowing from input sources to vulnerable or sensitive sinks. Cannot be determined without the actual code.",
