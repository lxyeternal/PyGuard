{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to perform an HTTP GET request to a specified URL, defaulting to 'https://google.com', and print the response status code.",
  "sources": "The code reads the URL input from a command-line option ('--url') and imports version info from a package (__version__).",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() function fetches data from the provided URL, and print outputs the response data.",
  "flows": "User provides URL via command-line argument -> requests.get() retrieves data from the URL -> Response URL and status are printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; usage of standard libraries; no suspicious network domains; no unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it takes an optional URL input, performs a GET request, and outputs the result. It relies on trusted libraries (click and requests). The default URL is a well-known domain (google.com). No input validation or sanitization is performed, but for a command-line URL parameter, this is typical. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network connections. The code appears to be a simple test script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a test script to perform an HTTP request to a specified URL. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
