  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that performs an HTTP GET request to a user-specified URL and outputs the response status and URL.",
  "sources": "Input from command-line option '--url'.",
  "sinks": "Requests to the specified URL; outputting response URL and status code.",
  "flows": "User provides URL -> requests.get() fetches URL -> response is printed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign URL fetcher using 'click' and 'requests'. It accepts user input for the URL without validation but does not perform any malicious actions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The only potential concern is misuse of the URL parameter, but this is typical for such scripts. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk but acknowledging potential misuse if used maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign URL request utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
