  "confidence": 0.9,
  "purpose": "The code provides a comprehensive suite of bioinformatics functions for data normalization, visualization, spatial analysis, network modeling, and statistical testing within biological research workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from AnnData objects, CSV files, pandas DataFrames, and external files; processes data through standard normalization, regression, and spatial computations.",
  "sinks": "Produces figures, dataframes, and network graphs; visualizations are saved locally if specified; no external network communication or data exfiltration detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through normalization, statistical modeling, and visualization functions; no suspicious external data flows or code injections observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; functions are domain-appropriate and transparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is domain-specific, employing standard libraries for data processing, visualization, and network analysis. No signs of malicious activity such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation. The functions are well-structured, with clear purposes aligned with bioinformatics workflows. No suspicious patterns or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign bioinformatics utility suite with no malicious intent or security concerns. The low risk score reflects the typical potential for misuse in visualization but no actual security threat.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
