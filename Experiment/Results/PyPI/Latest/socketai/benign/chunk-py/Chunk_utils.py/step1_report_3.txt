{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for analyzing and visualizing biological data, including gene expression normalization, spatial analysis, interaction network plotting, and statistical testing within a bioinformatics pipeline.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from external files (e.g., gene length files, AnnData objects, interaction DataFrames), user-supplied parameters, and model weights (e.g., linear weights from models). It also accesses data from adata.obsm and adata.X for spatial and gene expression data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include plotting functions that generate figures, file saving operations (e.g., savefig), and network or heatmap visualization. No direct data exfiltration, command execution, or code injection sources are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as files or dataframes through normalization, analysis, and filtering steps into visualization outputs. Model weights influence spatial plots; statistical results influence heatmaps and network visualizations.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes advanced visualization libraries (e.g., PyComplexHeatmap, openchord) and spatial analysis functions, but these are typical for bioinformatics. No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. No dynamic code execution or unsafe data handling is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code extensively utilizes external libraries for bioinformatics and visualization without performing unsafe system operations. Functions mainly process biological data, generate statistical analyses, and create plots. There are no functions or code segments that connect to network endpoints, send data over the network, or execute system commands. The code does handle input files and user parameters, but nothing indicates malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate bioinformatics utility collection with no evident malware vectors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of data processing, analysis, and visualization functions for biological data, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It is typical of scientific Python packages used in bioinformatics workflows. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present.",
