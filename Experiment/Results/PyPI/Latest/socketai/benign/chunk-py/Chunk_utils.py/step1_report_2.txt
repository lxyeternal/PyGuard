  "purpose": "Utility functions for processing and analyzing single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data, including normalization, visualization, and cell-cell interaction analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads data from CSV, AnnData objects, numpy arrays, and dataframes; accesses adata.obsm, adata.X, adata.var, and adata.obs; reads files via importlib.resources and Path.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted input includes counts matrices, gene length files, and dataframes. No explicit data sinks that transmit data externally; however, visualization functions save figures to disk if specified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through normalization, filtering, and analysis functions, culminating in visualization or data export (e.g., savefig). No external network communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.resources for default gene length file; extensive use of visualization libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, PyComplexHeatmap, etc.) with options to save figures; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors identified. Functions like getPosipotentialCCI and getNegapotentialCCI manipulate model weights and plot embeddings but do not transmit data externally.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data processing, normalization, statistical modeling, and plotting within a typical single-cell analysis pipeline. Functions for spatial analysis, ligand-receptor interactions, and network visualizations do not include network calls or external data exfiltration. No code indicates malicious intent such as data theft, reverse shells, or system damage. The inclusion of standard libraries and visualization tools is consistent with analytical workflows. The use of obscure or heavily obfuscated code is absent; most code is transparent and typical for data analysis. The only potential concern is the extensive visualization and figure saving which could be misused to generate misleading figures, but this is within normal scope for analysis tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a comprehensive set of analysis and visualization functions for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data. No evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware is found. The script performs data normalization, statistical modeling, visualization, and network analysis in a standard manner, with no external network communications or data exfiltration observed.",
