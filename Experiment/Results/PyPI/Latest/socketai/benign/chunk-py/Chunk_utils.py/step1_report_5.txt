{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for data processing, visualization, and analysis in bioinformatics, particularly for spatial transcriptomics and cell interaction data.",
  "sources": "Data is read from CSV files, AnnData objects, gene length files, and interaction data. Inputs include expression matrices, model weights, spatial coordinates, and interaction tables.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include plotting functions, network construction, and data merging; no direct data leaks or external connections are evident. Model weights and expression data are used locally within functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source inputs (files, AnnData objects, model outputs) through processing and filtering steps, into analysis functions, visualization, and statistical testing. No external network calls or data exfiltration points are detected.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive visualization functions, but no suspicious obfuscation, hard-coded secrets, or suspicious external calls are present. Use of external libraries appears standard for bioinformatics (e.g., scanpy, networkx, matplotlib). No malicious code patterns like reverse shells, system damage, or unauthorized data transmission are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code predominantly involves standard data processing, normalization, statistical analysis, and visualization for bioinformatics datasets. Functions like counts2FPKM/TPM, regression analyses, network visualization, and interaction heatmaps are typical for this domain. Usage of external libraries such as scanpy, networkx, and plotting libraries is appropriate. There are no indicators of malicious intent, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or system damage. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The code performs legitimate analyses, and all data handling appears to be local with no network transmission or covert channels.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard utility code for bioinformatics data analysis and visualization. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident. The code is consistent with expected functionalities in this domain and does not contain malware or obfuscated malicious logic.",
