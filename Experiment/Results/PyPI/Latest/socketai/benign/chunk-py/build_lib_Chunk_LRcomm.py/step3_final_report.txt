  "purpose": "Implementation of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithms for data decomposition, feature extraction, and source separation, utilizing standard scientific libraries.",
  "sources": "Input matrices X and S (for phenotype or similarity), data read from numpy arrays converted to torch tensors, no external data input during runtime.",
  "sinks": "No external data exfiltration, network communication, or file I/O; all computations are local within the process.",
  "flows": "Data flows through matrix operations within the code, including matrix multiplication, regularization, and eigen-decomposition, with no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected. The code employs standard algorithms and libraries without hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-known scientific algorithms (NMF, ICA) using established libraries such as torch, sklearn, numpy, and scipy. It includes regularization and convergence checks typical for such methods. No network activity, file system manipulation, or obfuscation is present. The functions serve legitimate purposes in data analysis and source separation. No anomalies or signals of malicious intent are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate scientific software implementing standard matrix factorization and ICA algorithms. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal risk consistent with the code's purpose.",
