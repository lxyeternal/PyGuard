  "purpose": "Implementation of various network-regularized statistical models including linear, Cox, ordinal logit, and logistic regression, with optional Laplacian regularization based on a similarity matrix.",
  "sources": "Input features X, similarity matrix Omega, survival times, event indicators, labels, and model parameters.",
  "sinks": "Model computations confined within the process; no external network communication, file I/O, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input through feature centering, model forward pass, loss calculation (including regularization), and optimizer updates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Logging statements are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard ML training routines with regularization based on graph Laplacians. No signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data theft, or sabotage. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses common libraries. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The use of sparse matrices and regularization matrices is typical for graph-based models. The print statements are benign and for monitoring training progress.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of graph-regularized statistical models with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is set to 0, the obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the benign and standard nature of the code.",
