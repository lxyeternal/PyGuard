{
  "purpose": "This code consists solely of import statements from internal modules related to data analysis and communication inference, with no runtime data processing, network activity, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules such as .CCcomm, .LRcomm, .preprocess, and .utils",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks in this static import context",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out lines do not indicate malicious intent; code is straightforward and static",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of import statements importing functions and classes from internal modules. No runtime execution, data handling, or network activity is present. The code structure is typical for a Python package organizing dependencies. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is zero. The import statements do not pose any security threat or obfuscation concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
