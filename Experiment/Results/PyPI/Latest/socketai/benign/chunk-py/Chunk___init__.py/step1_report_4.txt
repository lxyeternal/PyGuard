{
  "purpose": "The code imports various functions and classes from local modules related to communication inference, data preprocessing, utilities, and analysis in a computational biology context.",
  "sources": "Imports from modules: .CCcomm, .LRcomm, .preprocess, .utils",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no network, file system, or sensitive data handling observed",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly static imports",
  "anomalies": "All lines are commented out or straightforward import statements; no suspicious code execution, obfuscated logic, or hidden behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of import statements from internal modules, with some imports commented out. There are no hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or network operations. The imports suggest a scientific computing context, focusing on data filtering, correlation, and visualization functions. The absence of executable code, payloads, or suspicious patterns indicates low risk of malicious behavior. The structure and format are typical for a Python module import section, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of import statements for a scientific or analytical project. There are no indications of malicious code, sabotage, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate component of a data analysis pipeline.",
