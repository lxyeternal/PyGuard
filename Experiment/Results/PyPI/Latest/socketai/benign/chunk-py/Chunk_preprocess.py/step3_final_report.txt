{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for preprocessing biological data, including filtering gene expression matrices, constructing ligand-receptor interaction matrices, and processing clinical data for various analyses.",
  "sources": "File reading via importlib.resources.path for default database CSV; data input from pandas DataFrames and AnnData objects; gene expression data from adata.X; clinical data from DataFrames.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrames or AnnData objects through filtering, normalization, and matrix construction functions; no external untrusted data flows or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard libraries and patterns; benign warnings for missing genes; no suspicious code constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard bioinformatics preprocessing tasks, including filtering gene expression data, generating ligand-receptor pairs, normalizing clinical data, and constructing communication matrices. It relies on safe practices such as resource management via importlib.resources and pandas DataFrames. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The use of print warnings for missing genes is benign. The overall structure and behavior are consistent with typical scientific data processing scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious features. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
