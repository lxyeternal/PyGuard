{
  "purpose": "The code provides various utility functions for bioinformatics and spatial transcriptomics analysis, including data normalization, visualization, and interaction analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from files (e.g., genelen CSV, AnnData objects), function arguments (e.g., model weights, dataframes), and data attributes within AnnData objects.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include model parameters (e.g., model.linear.weight), dataframes, and outputs that could be used for further analysis or visualization. There are no functions directly executing untrusted code or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (files, dataframes, AnnData attributes) through processing functions (normalization, statistical modeling, visualization), with some functions using model weights or intermediate computed metrics to generate plots or statistical results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspiciously unusual code patterns detected. The code extensively uses third-party libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, statsmodels, scanpy, torch, networkx), but their usage appears consistent with normal bioinformatics workflows. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variable names observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical data normalization, statistical testing, and visualization tasks commonly used in bioinformatics analysis pipelines. It employs established libraries and standard data processing workflows. No code snippets or patterns suggest malicious intent or sabotage. There are no calls to system commands, external network communications, or hidden payloads. The functions operate within expected parameters for data analysis, with no evidence of malware behavior. The usage of model weights and data attributes is transparent, with no suspicious manipulations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of bioinformatics utility functions aimed at data normalization, interaction analysis, and visualization. No malicious behaviors, sabotage, or malware signals are detected. It appears safe and legitimate for its intended purpose within scientific data analysis workflows.",
