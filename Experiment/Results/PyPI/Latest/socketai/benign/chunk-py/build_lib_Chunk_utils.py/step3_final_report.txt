{
  "purpose": "The code provides bioinformatics utilities for data normalization, visualization, and interaction analysis, primarily for gene expression and spatial transcriptomics data.",
  "sources": "Reads data from CSV files, AnnData objects, and matrices; processes counts, gene lengths, and spatial coordinates.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include dataframes, plots, and network graphs; no external system calls or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input files or objects through normalization, statistical modeling, and visualization functions, with no external command execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden system calls detected; dependencies are standard and transparent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard bioinformatics functions for normalization (FPKM, TPM), statistical testing (regression, correlation), and visualization (heatmaps, network graphs). No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The functions operate within expected scientific workflows, with clear data flow and no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate collection of bioinformatics utilities with no malicious or sabotage behavior. It employs standard libraries and practices, with no external system calls or hidden payloads. The overall security risk is very low.",
