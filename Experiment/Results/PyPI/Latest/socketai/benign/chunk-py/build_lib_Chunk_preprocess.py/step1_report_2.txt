{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for preprocessing and analyzing biological data, including bulk, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomics data, as well as clinical data for research on ligand-receptor interactions and clinical constraints.",
  "sources": "Data read from CSV files, DataFrame inputs, and external resource paths via importlib.resources.",
  "sinks": "Potential data outputs to DataFrames, NumPy arrays, or CSV files; no explicit data sinks that leak data externally or perform dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrames and CSVs through processing functions to produce filtered data, expression matrices, and calculated matrices for downstream analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code, no suspicious code patterns. Use of importlib.resources is standard for packaged data access. No network operations or external data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data preprocessing tasks including filtering, normalization, and construction of clinical and interaction matrices. It reads data from files, processes expression matrices, and computes statistical measures. No parts of the code execute system commands, connect to external servers, or perform malicious actions. No suspicious code segments, backdoors, or hidden behaviors identified. All functions operate on data for scientific purposes with standard libraries. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscated or suspicious code blocks. The only minor concern could be the use of print warnings, but these are typical for data validation and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed for biological data analysis and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for scientific data processing with standard, safe practices. No evidence of malware or sabotage detected.",
