{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for preprocessing biological datasets, including filtering, normalization, and constructing ligand-receptor interaction matrices, primarily for bulk, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomics data.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV files for ligand-receptor pairs, accesses package data via importlib.resources.path, and reads data from pandas DataFrames and AnnData objects.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include filtered ligand-receptor pair DataFrames, expression matrices, and communication matrices; no external network or file writes are performed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrames and AnnData objects through filtering, normalization, and matrix operations, with no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. Use of standard libraries and safe data handling practices are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard bioinformatics data processing routines, including filtering based on expression thresholds, logarithmic transformation, and matrix construction. It uses safe, well-established libraries (pandas, numpy, importlib.resources). No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is detected. The functions operate in-memory, with no external command execution or data exfiltration. The logic is straightforward, and no suspicious patterns are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured biological data preprocessing module with no signs of sabotage, malware, or obfuscation. The security posture is sound, and the code is safe for use in supply chain contexts.",
