  "purpose": "Implementations of various graph-regularized machine learning models (regression, survival, ordinal, logistic) using PyTorch and sparse Laplacian matrices for regularization.",
  "sources": "Input data (X, y, time, event, labels), sparse similarity matrices (Omega), feature centering in center_features function.",
  "sinks": "No external network communication, data exfiltration, or system commands; data flows are internal within training routines.",
  "flows": "Data from input variables to model forward passes, regularization terms, and loss computations; no external data or network flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors; use of sparse matrices and standard ML routines is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple models with Laplacian regularization, converting sparse matrices to PyTorch tensors, performing standard training routines with Adam optimizer, and no external communication. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are present. The regularization approach and data handling are standard in graph-based ML. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses common libraries and practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of graph-regularized ML models with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk scores (around 0.1-0.2) are justified given the benign nature and standard practices. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. The overall assessment indicates minimal supply chain security concern.",
