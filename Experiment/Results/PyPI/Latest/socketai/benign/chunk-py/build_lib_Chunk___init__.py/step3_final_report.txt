{
  "purpose": "Import statements for various modules related to bioinformatics or data analysis, setting up functions and classes for downstream processing.",
  "sources": "Local module imports (.CCcomm, .LRcomm, .preprocess, .utils). No external data sources or input handling observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow or untrusted data handling within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A; only import statements, no data or control flow.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out import lines are benign; no obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, with function and class names indicating a scientific or bioinformatics context. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The functions imported could process untrusted data in usage, but the import statements themselves are harmless. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is zero.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of import statements for data analysis modules. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores should reflect a very low threat level.",
