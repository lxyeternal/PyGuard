  "purpose": "Define custom pagination classes compatible with Django REST Framework, supporting page number and limit-offset pagination styles.",
  "sources": "Request object methods (get_full_path), class attributes, and internal methods for count and URL construction.",
  "sinks": "URL manipulation via urlparse._replace and geturl methods.",
  "flows": "Request URLs are fetched and modified to generate next/previous links based on pagination parameters.",
  "anomalies": "URL modification via urlparse._replace(query=...) could potentially manipulate query strings, but in this context it is a controlled operation for pagination links; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious data found.",
  "analysis": "The code implements pagination logic with standard input validation and URL manipulation for generating navigation links. No untrusted data flows directly into unsafe sinks; URL modifications are standard and based on request URLs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The URL handling appears correct for pagination purposes. The code's structure and usage are typical for pagination implementations, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides standard pagination classes for API responses without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs URL modifications safely for pagination links, with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks.",
