{
  "purpose": "Provides DRF-compatible pagination classes for handling paginated responses via URL or limit-offset parameters.",
  "sources": "request.get_full_path() for URL retrieval; URL parsing via urlparse for link generation.",
  "sinks": "URL modification using urlparse._replace() to generate next/previous links.",
  "flows": "Request URL is parsed and modified to produce pagination links based on page or offset parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; straightforward URL manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard pagination logic using URL parsing and string formatting. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. URL modifications are controlled and typical for pagination links. No external untrusted data injection or unsafe operations are observed. The security implications are minimal, with URL manipulations being safe in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of pagination classes for DRF, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minor variations in security risk scores (0.1–0.2) are justified by the URL handling but do not indicate any vulnerability or malicious intent.",
