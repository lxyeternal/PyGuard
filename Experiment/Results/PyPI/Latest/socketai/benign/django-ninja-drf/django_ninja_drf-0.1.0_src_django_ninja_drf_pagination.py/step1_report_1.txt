{
  "purpose": "Provides pagination classes compatible with Django Rest Framework (DRF) for paginating querysets via page number or limit-offset methods.",
  "sources": "Input data from the request object (get_full_path method), specifically the request's URL and query parameters.",
  "sinks": "URL parsing and modification via urlparse and _replace to generate next/previous links; these are safe operations without external data injection points.",
  "flows": "Request URL is fetched via request.get_full_path(), then the URL is parsed, query parameters are replaced with new page/offset values, and a new URL is generated. No external untrusted data flows into the URL modification logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. Pagination logic is standard and secure. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two pagination classes: PageNumberPagination and LimitOffsetPagination, both inheriting from PaginationBase. They handle pagination logic by computing offsets and generating next/previous links using URL parsing functions. Input schemas validate page, limit, and offset parameters. The URL modification process relies on standard library functions without executing or evaluating external data beyond URL parsing and string formatting. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware-like actions are present. The code appears to be well-structured, with standard practices for URL manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of pagination classes for DRF, with no malicious or suspicious elements. It securely handles URL parameters and pagination logic without evident security issues or malware indications.",
