  "purpose": "Provides pagination classes for API responses, implementing DRF-compatible page number and limit-offset pagination schemes.",
  "sources": "User request data via request.get_full_path() for constructing pagination links.",
  "sinks": "URL manipulation via urlparse and _replace to generate next and previous page links.",
  "flows": "Input page/offset parameters from request; pagination methods calculate next/previous links based on URL and query params.",
  "anomalies": "Use of urlparse and _replace to modify query parameters; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two pagination classes that generate next/previous links by parsing and modifying the URL query parameters. Data flows from request.get_full_path() into URL construction functions, but these operations are standard URL manipulations without any dynamic or unsafe code execution. No embedded or hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code strictly handles pagination logic without external data or system commands. No obfuscated or malicious code structures detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, secure pagination logic with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It correctly manages URL modifications for pagination links without introducing vulnerabilities.",
