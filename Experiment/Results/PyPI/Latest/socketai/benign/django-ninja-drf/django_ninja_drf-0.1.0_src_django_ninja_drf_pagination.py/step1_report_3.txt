  "purpose": "Defines pagination classes compatible with Django REST Framework, providing page number and limit-offset pagination methods.",
  "sources": "request.get_full_path() calls for obtaining current URL; input parameters page, limit, offset from schemas.",
  "sinks": "URL manipulation using urlparse and _replace, potential for malformed URL if inputs are manipulated, but not inherently dangerous.",
  "flows": "request.get_full_path() -> urlparse -> _replace(query=...) -> geturl() for constructing next/previous links.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard pagination logic with safe URL manipulation. It uses standard libraries and pattern without any malicious behaviors. No suspicious data leaks, code injections, or malicious network activity detected. The URL modifications are straightforward and based solely on input page or offset values. No data is sent over network or stored maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of pagination classes without malicious intent. It does not contain malware or security risks. The logic is clear, and URL handling is safe with proper use of urlparse.",
