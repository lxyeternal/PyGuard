  "purpose": "A simple Python function returning a static greeting string, with no inputs or external dependencies.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external data or inputs.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the function simply returns a hardcoded string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a trivial function returning a static string with no inputs, external calls, or dynamic behavior. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present, and the code does not perform any risky operations. The analysis confirms that the code is safe and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The current scores and analysis are appropriate and do not require modification.",
