  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content Verification**:\nThe original code is a very simple function:\n```python\ndef hello() -> str:\n    return \"Hello from django-ninja-drf!\"\n```\nIt is a static function returning a hardcoded string with no inputs, external calls, or dynamic behavior.\n\n2. **Assessment of Reports**:\nAll five reports consistently state that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. They note the absence of data flows, external data reads, or suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**:\n- The reports are accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is simple and safe.\n- There are no errors or flawed reasoning in the reports.\n\n4. **Scores Given and Their Reasonableness**:\n- `obfuscated`: 0 for all reports — correct, as there's no obfuscation.\n- `malware`: 0 for all reports — correct, as there's no malicious activity.\n- `securityRisk`: 0 for all reports — appropriate, given the benign nature.\n- `confidence`: 1 for all — justified, given the simplicity and clarity.\n- The reports' conclusions align well with the code's actual behavior.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are made, and none are implied.\n- The reports do not overstate the risk or suggest any hidden malicious intent.\n- The code is too trivial to contain obfuscation or malware.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n- Since the code is static and simple, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The reports are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a straightforward, static function returning a greeting string. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe current scoring and analysis are appropriate. The code poses no security or malicious concern, and the reports accurately reflect this.",
