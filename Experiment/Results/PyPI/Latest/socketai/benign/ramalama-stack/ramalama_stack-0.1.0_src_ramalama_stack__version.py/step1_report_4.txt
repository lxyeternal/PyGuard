{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, for use in package metadata and version control.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns static version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows or can lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; all data is statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes conditional type hinting that does not execute at runtime, and version information is hardcoded with no secrets or dynamic content.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple version metadata module, with no external input, no dynamic data handling, no suspicious code patterns, no code execution, and no data leakage points. The conditional import for type hints is standard practice and does not introduce security risks. The version information is static and explicitly set. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign, non-malicious code primarily used for package versioning. It does not contain any malware or security risks.",
