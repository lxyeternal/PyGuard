  "purpose": "Define version information for the package using static assignment, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings assigned to variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from external inputs to sensitive functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static with no dynamic or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module defining version variables, including __version__, version, __version_tuple__, and version_tuple. It contains a conditional type checking block, which is standard for type hints. All assignments are static and hardcoded, with no input handling or external data fetching. There are no suspicious functions or code constructs that could indicate malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a version information holder generated by setuptools-scm. No malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risk is present.",
