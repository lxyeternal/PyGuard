  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm, providing version strings and tuples.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external output.",
  "flows": "Assignment from hardcoded version strings to module variables; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the version information is hardcoded and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version variables for a Python package using static, hardcoded values. There are no sources of untrusted input, no data flows from external input, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be a standard generated version info module, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version info module with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply defines static version data for a package.",
