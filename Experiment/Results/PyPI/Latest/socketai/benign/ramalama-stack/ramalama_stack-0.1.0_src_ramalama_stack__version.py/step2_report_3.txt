  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review**:\n   - The code is a straightforward module defining version information variables (`__version__`, `version`, `__version_tuple__`, `version_tuple`) with static, hardcoded values.\n   - It includes a conditional block for type hints (`TYPE_CHECKING`) which is standard practice.\n   - There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, or obfuscated code.\n   - The comments indicate it is auto-generated by `setuptools-scm`.\n   \n   **Conclusion**: The code appears benign, serving solely as a version metadata holder.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports**:\n   - All reports uniformly state that the code is straightforward, static, generated by `setuptools-scm`, with no suspicious behavior, no data leaks, no external inputs, and no malicious intent.\n   - They assign a `malware` score of 0, `obfuscated` score of 0, and `securityRisk` score of 0.\n   - The confidence level is high (1) across all reports.\n   - The analysis in each report is consistent and accurate.\n\n3. **Potential Issues or Flaws**:\n   - No issues are present in the code.\n   - No logical flaws, vulnerabilities, or malicious patterns are identified.\n   - The reports do not overstate or understate the security implications.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is detected.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The security risk score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or attack vectors are present.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is auto-generated and static, there is no reason to suspect supply chain tampering.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or used maliciously.\n\n**Final Justification**:\n- The code is a benign, static version info module.\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that there is no malicious intent or security concern here.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: The code is a standard, benign version metadata file generated by `setuptools-scm`. All reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the absence of any security issues.",
