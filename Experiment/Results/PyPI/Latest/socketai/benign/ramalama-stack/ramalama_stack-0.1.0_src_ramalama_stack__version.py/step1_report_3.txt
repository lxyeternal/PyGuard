  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version variables, string literal defining version number.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string to variables; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns version information to variables, includes type hints conditioned on TYPE_CHECKING, and avoids any runtime data input or external data processing. There are no suspicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs. The comments specify that this file is auto-generated by setuptools-scm, and it only defines version metadata. No external inputs, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version definition file with no malicious intent or security issues. It serves solely to provide version metadata for the package.",
