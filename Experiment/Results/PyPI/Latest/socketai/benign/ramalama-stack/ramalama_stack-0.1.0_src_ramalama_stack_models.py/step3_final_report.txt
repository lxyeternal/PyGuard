  "purpose": "Configuration of model registry entries with static identifiers and metadata for various llama models and embeddings.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings within function calls such as build_hf_repo_model_entry, build_model_entry, and direct instantiation of ProviderModelEntry objects.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static data used solely for configuration purposes.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from hardcoded identifiers into data structures without any dynamic or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a list of model entries using predefined functions and static strings, serving as configuration data for model registration. No external data fetching, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The functions used are imported modules likely designed for configuration, and the data appears consistent and appropriate. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are detected. The structure and purpose are clear and standard for such configuration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration script for registering models and embeddings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified given the nature of the code.",
