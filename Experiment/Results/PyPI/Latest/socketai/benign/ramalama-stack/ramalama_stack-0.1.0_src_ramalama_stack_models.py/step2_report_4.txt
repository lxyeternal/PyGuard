  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the code is a straightforward configuration script with static data, no malicious activity, and no anomalies.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 aligns with the analysis. Obfuscated 0 is appropriate. Security risk 0 is justified given the static, benign nature.\n- **Potential issues:** No issues found. The code is purely data setup.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes static data, no external inputs, and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0 are appropriate.\n- **Potential issues:** No concerns. The functions used appear to be standard for configuration.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is a static configuration with no dynamic or suspicious elements.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0 fit the observed code.\n- **Potential issues:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; static data, no external data or suspicious code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; static configuration for model registration.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is purely configuration with static data. No dynamic code execution, no external data fetching, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, no network activity.\n- **Malware concerns:** None. The code only constructs data structures for models.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; standard configuration code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks evident)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign configuration script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are consistent, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
