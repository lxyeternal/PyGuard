  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a static configuration setup, importing functions and creating data structures with fixed data. No dynamic code execution, external data, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment appears accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it notes static data, no external inputs, and straightforward function calls. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid and consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is static, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The functions used seem to be standard for configuration.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—static configuration, no external or untrusted data, straightforward function calls.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous, no suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is purely configuration with static data.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected; the code doesn't perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Risk scores:** All are appropriately set to 0, given the benign nature.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Potential for higher scores:** None justified; the code is a straightforward setup script.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the code poses no security risks or malicious intent. The scores reflect this appropriately.",
