  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration class with a placeholder string for environment variables. It does not perform any dynamic environment variable expansion or code execution, and there are no malicious or obfuscated elements. The environment variable syntax is just a string pattern, not an active feature, resulting in no security risk. The current scores are appropriate; the risk score could be lowered to zero for accuracy. Overall, the code is safe and supply chain secure."
