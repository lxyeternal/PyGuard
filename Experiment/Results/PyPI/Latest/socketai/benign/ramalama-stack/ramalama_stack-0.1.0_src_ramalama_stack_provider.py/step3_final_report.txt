  "purpose": "Configuration for remote inference provider with specified API, adapter, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'llama_stack.providers.datatypes'; static return of 'remote_provider_spec' with fixed parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Function get_provider_spec() returns a configuration object with static parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; hardcoded package versions are standard in configuration files.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific data types, defines a function that returns a configuration object with fixed API type, adapter specifications, and pip packages. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or untrusted data handling are present. The static nature and standard dependencies suggest a benign setup. All reports correctly identify the code as a straightforward configuration with no malicious intent. Malware scores are appropriately zero; security risk scores are low (~0.1), justified by the static configuration and dependency management. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration snippet for setting up a provider. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
