  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected; code is straightforward configuration.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is low (0.1). These seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** The report correctly states no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and standard dependencies.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected; standard configuration.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0.0–0.1, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **Justification:** The code is simple and typical for configuration; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected; straightforward setup.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is low (0.1).\n- **Justification:** The code is static, with no dynamic or malicious elements.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; configuration code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is low.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; standard configuration.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is low.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious patterns or behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, static code.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (0.1), reflecting minimal security concern, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned across all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low security risk, typical for static configuration code)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns well with the code's benign, configuration-only nature.",
