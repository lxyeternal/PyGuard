{
  "purpose": "This code extends the jiwer library to support token pre-computation for word error rate and alignment calculations between texts and edits.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: texts and edits; Data transformations via jiwer's transform functions; External library calls: _apply_transform, _word2int, get_opcodes.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effects could occur if untrusted input is processed without validation; however, the code only performs transformations and computations without external communications or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Input texts and edits are transformed, converted to integers, and aligned via get_opcodes; counts of errors are accumulated; final metrics are calculated and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected. The code mainly performs data validation, transformation, and computation. No dynamic code execution or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input types and non-empty strings, applies transformations, and converts text to integer tokens for alignment. It uses the rapidfuzz library for sequence alignment and computes standard metrics for text similarity. All operations are typical for a text processing library extension. No external system calls, network communication, or obfuscated code are present. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate extension of jiwer for improved token-level processing. It performs expected transformations and computations without malicious behavior. No security risks are evident based on this review.",
