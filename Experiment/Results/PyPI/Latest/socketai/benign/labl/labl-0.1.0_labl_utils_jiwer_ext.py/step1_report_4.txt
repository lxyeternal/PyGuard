{
  "purpose": "Extend the jiwer library to support token pre-computation for word error rate and alignment calculations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: texts, edits, and optional transforms; usage of _apply_transform and _word2int functions; external get_opcodes function for sequence comparison.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no code writes to files, network, or system resources. No use of untrusted external data sources or sensitive info handling.",
  "flows": "Input data is transformed via _apply_transform, then converted into integers by _word2int; sequence comparison is performed using get_opcodes; results are aggregated and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation present. No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. Usage of casting is standard for type safety.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard text processing for computing word error rates, with input validation, optional pre-transformation, and sequence alignment. It uses established libraries and functions for comparison, with no signs of malicious logic. No external network calls, file I/O, or obfuscated code features are present. It appears to be a typical implementation extension for processing text data in the context of speech or text recognition evaluation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard extension for computing word-level Levenshtein distance and alignment, with no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It adheres to expected behavior for its purpose, with safe handling of inputs and outputs.",
