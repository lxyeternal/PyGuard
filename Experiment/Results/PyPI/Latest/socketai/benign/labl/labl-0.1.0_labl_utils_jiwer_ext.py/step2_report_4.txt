  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code to verify claims, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code extends 'jiwer' to support token pre-computation, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes that the code performs standard input validation, transformation, and alignment using trusted libraries (`jiwer`, `rapidfuzz`). No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; the code appears legitimate and secure.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a legitimate extension with no malicious intent, and no external sinks or suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies that the code performs standard processing steps, with external functions (`_apply_transform`, `_word2int`) presumed safe. No network, file, or environment manipulations are evident.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning aligns with the code; no malware or security risks are apparent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the slight securityRisk is acceptable given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is a standard extension, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The review correctly points out that the code only performs internal processing, with no external data leaks or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent with the code; no issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; no suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard processing.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis matches the code's operations, which are straightforward and rely on trusted libraries.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a legitimate extension with no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The review correctly notes the absence of external system calls, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe and standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that the code performs standard text processing, leveraging trusted external libraries and internal functions. No network, file, or environment manipulations are present.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident.\n- **Security Risk:** Given the code's scope and operations, the security risk is minimal, mostly related to handling untrusted input, which is standard for such processing functions.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0** — no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** Should be **low (around 0)**, reflecting the benign nature of the code, with perhaps a minor securityRisk (0.1) if considering potential input validation concerns, but overall negligible.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Recommended Value | Justification                                                      |\n|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                   | No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior present.      |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                   | Code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard libraries.       |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1 (or 0)        | Slightly elevated due to input handling, but no real risk detected. |\n\n**Final note:** The detailed review confirms that the code is a legitimate, safe extension of the 'jiwer' library, with no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
