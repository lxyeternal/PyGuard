  "purpose": "Extends jiwer to support token pre-computation for word error rate calculations, involving input validation, transformations, tokenization, and alignment.",
  "sources": "Input texts and edits, which are validated, transformed, and tokenized internally.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no external sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input texts/edits -> transformations -> tokenization -> alignment via get_opcodes -> calculation of error metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard text processing for error metrics, using trusted libraries and internal functions. It validates inputs, applies optional transformations, converts texts to integer tokens, and aligns sequences to compute metrics like WER. No external system calls, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The logic is straightforward and consistent with legitimate text processing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe extension of the 'jiwer' library for token pre-computation, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
