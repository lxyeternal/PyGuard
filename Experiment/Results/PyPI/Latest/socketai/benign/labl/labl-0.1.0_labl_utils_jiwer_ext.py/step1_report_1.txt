{
  "purpose": "This code extends the 'jiwer' library to support token pre-computation for computing word error rate and related metrics between texts and edits.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'texts' and 'edits' (user-provided data), 'texts_transform' and 'edits_transform' (transform functions). Internal functions '_apply_transform' and '_word2int' process data, and 'get_opcodes' retrieves alignment data.",
  "sinks": "Data processing occurs within the function; no external sinks like network or file operations are present. No untrusted data flows into system-critical functions or external systems.",
  "flows": "User inputs ('texts', 'edits') are transformed via '_apply_transform'; these transformed data are converted into integers via '_word2int'; then 'get_opcodes' analyzes sequences for alignment and error metrics.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard text processing, with no unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The usage of type casts appears routine. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input types and content, applies optional transformations, and ensures matching lengths of input data. It uses 'get_opcodes' for sequence alignment, which is a standard approach. Counts of hits, substitutions, deletions, and insertions are accumulated to compute error metrics. No external calls or network operations are performed. The functions used are from trusted, open-source libraries, and there are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate text processing tasks to compute word error rates and related metrics. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The structure and functions used are standard for such applications. No security risks or malware indications are evident.",
