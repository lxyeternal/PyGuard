{
  "purpose": "The code extends the jiwer library to support token pre-computation for word error rate calculations, specifically processing texts and their edits to produce alignment and error metrics.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'texts' and 'edits', environment variables (indirectly through potential transform functions), and imported functions like '_apply_transform' and '_word2int'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks directly handle untrusted data; computations are internal. No network operations, file I/O, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through validation, transformation, and mapping functions, then into alignment and error counting procedures. No external sinks for data are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard processing steps for string transformation and alignment; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code patterns. Casts and validation are normal.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs input validation, applies transformations, converts text into tokenized integers, and aligns sequences using get_opcodes. All operations are standard for error rate calculations. No evidence of malicious code such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It uses external functions like '_apply_transform' and '_word2int' which are presumed safe based on context. No obfuscated or misleading code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate extension of the jiwer library for token pre-computation in error rate metrics. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks in the provided code fragment.",
