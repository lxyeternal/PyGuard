{
  "purpose": "The code extends the jiwer library to support token pre-computation and calculates word-level alignment and error rates between texts and edits.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: texts, edits, and their respective transformations. Also, external functions like _apply_transform and _word2int for processing.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, perform network operations, or handle untrusted outputs directly.",
  "flows": "Inputs (texts and edits) are transformed via _apply_transform, then converted to integers via _word2int, and processed with get_opcodes for alignment. The results are aggregated and returned as a WordOutput object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses standard Python practices and external libraries for string processing. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution is present. The use of _apply_transform and _word2int appears standard and safe. No network activity, file I/O, or environment variable use is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation, applies transformations, and computes Levenshtein-based alignments and error rates. It relies on external, reputable libraries (jiwer, rapidfuzz) and internal functions. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors are evident. The code functions solely for text processing and alignment. The use of external libraries is standard, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate extension of the jiwer library for token pre-computation and text alignment. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. Its design is consistent with text processing tasks and does not pose a supply chain threat.",
