  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of inter-annotator agreement metrics, with no malicious or obfuscated components. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's functionality. No modifications are necessary; the code is safe for use in standard reliability assessments."
