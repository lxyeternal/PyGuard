{
  "purpose": "The code computes inter-annotator agreement metrics such as Krippendorff's alpha and Spearman's rank correlation for label data, primarily for evaluating consistency in annotations or labelings.",
  "sources": "Inputs include labels_array (NDArray of label values), label_type (type of labels), and optional level_of_measurement. These are used to calculate agreement scores.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to write data to external sources, execute system commands, or perform network communication. It mainly processes data internally for statistical calculations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'labels_array' into agreement calculations, with internal use of functions from numpy, krippendorff, and scipy to produce agreement metrics. No untrusted data output to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code uses standard libraries and well-known statistical methods. No obfuscated or hidden code identified.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward calculation of inter-annotator agreement metrics. It validates input types and shapes, computes Krippendorff's alpha for categorical or ordinal data, and Spearman's correlation for binary-encoded numeric labels. There are no signs of malicious logic, such as network operations, data exfiltration, or code injection. All operations are statistical and data processing related. No hidden or obfuscated elements are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate statistical utility for measuring inter-annotator agreement. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on its structure and functions. No signs of sabotage or malware are detected.",
