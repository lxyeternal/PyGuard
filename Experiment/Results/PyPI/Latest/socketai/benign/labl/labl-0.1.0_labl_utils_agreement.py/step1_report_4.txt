{
  "purpose": "The code computes inter-annotator agreement metrics (Krippendorff's alpha and Spearman's rho) for labeled data, supporting different measurement levels and data types.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'labels_array' parameter, which is a NumPy array of label values.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data influences system commands, file writes, network calls, or sensitive data transmission.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'labels_array' through calculations involving Krippendorff's alpha or Spearman correlation, ending with the creation of an AgreementOutput object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code constructs are present. The code performs standard statistical calculations and formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and third-party packages for statistical analysis. It defines data classes and functions to calculate agreement scores. The main function 'get_labels_agreement' determines the level of measurement based on input data type, computes unique label values, and then calculates either Krippendorff's alpha or Spearman's rho depending on data characteristics. The code includes standard data validation, type handling, and output formatting. No network operations, file I/O, or dynamic code execution is present. It strictly performs statistical computations on input label data, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of statistical agreement measures with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It only processes data provided as input and produces agreement scores, with no evident malicious behavior.",
