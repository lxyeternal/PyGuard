{
  "purpose": "The code computes inter-annotator agreement metrics, specifically Krippendorff's alpha and Spearman correlation, for label datasets.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'labels_array' parameter, including shape and dtype, and potentially reads label values from the array.",
  "sinks": "Uses external libraries 'krippendorff' and 'scipy.stats' to compute statistical metrics; no direct data leaks or malicious actions observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'labels_array' flows into calculations of unique values, agreement scores, and pairwise metrics, then outputs structured AgreementOutput object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or misleading variable names. The code performs standard statistical calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and external packages to perform statistical agreement calculations. It dynamically determines the measurement level based on input types, performs checks on data types, and calculates agreement scores with well-defined logic. No suspicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads is present. The use of external libraries 'krippendorff' and 'scipy' is standard for statistical analysis. The code handles different data types and includes validation for unsupported types, ensuring robustness. The overall structure is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of inter-annotator agreement metrics, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard statistical methods and libraries, and there are no suspicious or malicious operations observed.",
