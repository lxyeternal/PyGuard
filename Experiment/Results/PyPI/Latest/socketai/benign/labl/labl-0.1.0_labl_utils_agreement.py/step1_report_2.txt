{
  "purpose": "The code computes inter-annotator agreement metrics, specifically Krippendorff's alpha and Spearman correlation, for labeled data.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from a numpy ndarray (labels_array), and input parameters such as label_type and level_of_measurement.",
  "sinks": "Returns an AgreementOutput object containing computed agreement scores; no data sinks or external communications are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from labels_array and input parameters through calculations involving krippendorff and spearmanr functions, culminating in the AgreementOutput object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code patterns are present. External libraries are used appropriately for statistical calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs statistical computations for agreement measures, using standard libraries and functions. It verifies label types and handles numeric and string labels properly. No code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. It utilizes well-known scientific libraries without suspicious dynamic code execution. No hidden or malicious behaviors are detected. All logic appears focused on valid statistical analysis, with appropriate data validation and error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate statistical analysis module for inter-annotator agreement metrics. It employs standard libraries with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The overall security risk is very low.",
