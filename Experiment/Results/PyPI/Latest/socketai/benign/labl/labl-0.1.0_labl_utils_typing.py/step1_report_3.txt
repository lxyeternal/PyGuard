  "purpose": "Definition of a type alias LabelType that can be str, int, float, or None.",
  "sources": "No input sources; this is a type alias declaration.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only declares a type alias.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple type alias with no unusual constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a type alias named LabelType which can be one of four types: str, int, float, or None. It uses Python 3.10's union type syntax. There are no input sources, no data handling, no control flow, and no suspicious or malicious constructs present. It appears to be a straightforward type alias for clarity or type hinting in larger codebases.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type alias declaration with no malicious intent or security risks.",
