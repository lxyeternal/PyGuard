  "purpose": "Define a type alias 'LabelType' that can be a str, int, float, or None.",
  "sources": "None; the code only declares a type alias without input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows since the code only defines a type alias.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward type alias declaration with modern syntax using the union type annotation.",
  "analysis": "The code declares 'LabelType' as a type alias for a union of str, int, float, and None. It employs the new Python 3.10+ syntax for union types, which is valid and standard. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no untrusted data handling. The code appears to be a simple, safe type hinting statement without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type alias declaration with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It simply provides a flexible type hint for labels.",
