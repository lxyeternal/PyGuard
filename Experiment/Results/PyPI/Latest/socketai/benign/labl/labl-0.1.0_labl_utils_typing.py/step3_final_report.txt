  "purpose": "Define a type alias 'LabelType' as a union of str, int, float, or None for type hinting purposes.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a simple type alias declaration with no input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data flows, untrusted data, or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "None; no source-to-sink data flow exists in this code.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, using standard Python syntax for type unions, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a modern Python type alias declaration using the union operator '|', introduced in Python 3.10+. It serves solely for type hinting and does not process data, read inputs, or perform any system operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign purpose, with no potential for malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard type alias declaration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security concerns. All signals and reports correctly identify it as safe, and the scores are appropriate and consistent with its benign nature.",
