  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a type alias `LabelType` defined as `str | int | float | None`.\n- The code is purely a type hint declaration, with no data processing, input/output, or system interaction.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and uses modern Python syntax.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports indicate any actual issues in the code. The code snippet is syntactically correct and semantically benign.\n- **Malicious behavior:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Logical and scoring review:\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign a security risk score of 0, which is consistent given the benign nature.\n- **Purpose and analysis:** All reports correctly identify the code as a simple type alias declaration, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.\n\n### Score justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate; no security risk.\n\n### Any potential issues with the reports?\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as benign and do not overstate any risks.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores are appropriate and consistent with the code and the reports.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the review, I concur with the reports. The code is a simple, benign type alias with no security implications.\n\n**Proposed scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** No security concerns or malicious intent detected. The code is safe and standard.",
