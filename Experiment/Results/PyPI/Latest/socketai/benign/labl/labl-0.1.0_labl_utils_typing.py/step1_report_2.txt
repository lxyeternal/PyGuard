{
  "purpose": "Defines a type alias 'LabelType' that can be a string, integer, float, or None.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing occurs; this is a type alias declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual or suspicious aspects are absent; the code is a simple type annotation.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a type alias named 'LabelType' using Python's union type notation. It allows 'LabelType' to be either str, int, float, or None. This is a straightforward, common pattern in type hinting and does not include any executable logic, data handling, or external dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code's simplicity and lack of data processing indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign type alias declaration with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard Python type annotation and does not contain any suspicious elements.",
