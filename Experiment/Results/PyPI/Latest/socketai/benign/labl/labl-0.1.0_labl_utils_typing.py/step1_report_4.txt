  "purpose": "Definition of a type alias 'LabelType' as a union of basic data types (str, int, float, None).",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources used in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points; the code only defines a type alias.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow; purely a type annotation definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a type alias 'LabelType' using Python's Union syntax with type hints. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or side effects. It is a simple type annotation for use elsewhere in a codebase. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation, and the code appears to be standard Python syntax for type hints.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign type alias definition with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and serves a type hinting purpose.",
