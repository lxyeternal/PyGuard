{
  "purpose": "Define an interface and a simple function for aggregating label data, used in NLP annotation tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'labels' sequence input parameter in 'label_sum_aggregation'. No other external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The code does not have any data sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The main flow involves taking a sequence of labels and combining them via addition, with type checks to ensure consistency.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The use of 'type' comparison and addition is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a protocol for label aggregation and implements a sum-based aggregation function. It checks for consistent types among labels before summing. There are no external calls, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No obfuscation or malicious intent is apparent. The code is straightforward and appears solely to support label aggregation in NLP annotation workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for normal label aggregation purposes. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
