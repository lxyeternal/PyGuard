{
  "purpose": "Provides aggregation functions for combining and summarizing multiple labels in NLP tasks, such as span labeling and sequence merging.",
  "sources": "The code reads input labels from sequences passed to the label_sum_aggregation function.",
  "targets": "The code does not explicitly write to any external system or file; it processes data internally.",
  "flows": "Input labels are aggregated via the label_sum_aggregation function, which combines labels by summation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses type checks to ensure type consistency but nothing appears malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a protocol interface for label aggregation, with an implementation of a sum aggregation function. It performs type checks to ensure all labels are of the same type before summing them. There are no obfuscated constructs, network operations, or file manipulations. The code is straightforward and designed for internal data processing without external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of label aggregation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected data processing tasks securely and transparently.",
