{
  "purpose": "This code provides aggregation functions for combining multiple label annotations, primarily for use in natural language processing tasks such as span-to-token label propagation and sequence alignment.",
  "sources": "The code reads input labels from the 'labels' sequence parameter in the 'label_sum_aggregation' function.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data leads to potential harm, such as network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input labels are taken from the 'labels' sequence; the aggregation function processes these labels by summing them if types match, returning an aggregated label.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns, unusual language features, or hidden behaviors. The use of type checks and simple summation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a protocol for label aggregation and implements a sum-based aggregation function. It performs input validation by checking for type consistency among labels before summing. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious operations are present. The code's intent is benign, focusing on combining labels in a straightforward manner. No external data sources, network activity, or credential handling is involved.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign implementation of label aggregation with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs simple operations and adheres to expected coding practices.",
