  "purpose": "Provides functions and protocols for aggregating label data in text annotation tasks.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs are read; the code primarily defines functions and protocols.",
  "sinks": "No data is sent to external systems, network, or stored; the code only performs in-memory aggregation.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows involving untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and follows typical patterns for label aggregation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Protocol interface for label aggregation and a concrete implementation 'label_sum_aggregation' which sums labels of the same type. The implementation includes type checking to ensure all labels are of the same type before summing, which mitigates potential errors. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors. The code is purely functional, intended for label processing within a larger system. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for label aggregation in text annotation workflows. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks within this module.",
