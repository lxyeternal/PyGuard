  "purpose": "Provides functions for aggregating and summarizing multiple labels, useful in NLP tasks such as span-to-token label propagation, gap merging, and multi-edit summarization.",
  "sources": "The code reads label sequences passed as function arguments in 'label_sum_aggregation'. No external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or external data outputs; the code operates entirely in-memory on provided label sequences.",
  "flows": "Input label sequences are processed within 'label_sum_aggregation', with type checks and summation, resulting in an aggregated label; no external flows or data leaks occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code performs straightforward type-checked summation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a label aggregation protocol and implements a sum-based aggregation function that sums labels of the same type with a type check to prevent mismatches. It returns None for empty inputs. The implementation is simple, safe, and does not involve external data, network activity, or obfuscation. The type check ensures type safety, and the summation relies on labels supporting addition. No malicious or security-related issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for label aggregation with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
