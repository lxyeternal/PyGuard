{
  "purpose": "Provides aggregation functions for combining and summarizing multiple label values, specifically for token and span label propagation, gap merging, and multi-edit summarization in NLP tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'labels' parameter in the function 'label_sum_aggregation'. Imports from standard libraries and a local module 'labl.utils.typing'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed in a way that could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'labels' parameter through the aggregation function, combining label values via addition, returning the result or None if empty.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a type check to ensure all labels are of the same type before aggregation. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present. The use of 'type(l) is not type(out)' is precise but may be slightly unconventional compared to 'type(l) != type(out)'.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a protocol for label aggregation and implements a sum-based aggregation function that sums labels of the same type. It performs a type check to prevent combining incompatible label types. No external or untrusted input is manipulated in a risky way. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, safe implementation of label aggregation, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It functions solely to combine labels via addition, with appropriate type checks.",
