  "sources": "Input string 's' in process_string methods, external model identifiers in AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained.",
  "sinks": "Conversion of token IDs to tokens, tokenizer.tokenize method, loading models from external sources.",
  "flows": "Input string -> regex or tokenizer -> tokens; model identifier -> model loading -> tokenizer input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. External model loading could be exploited if untrusted sources are used.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries and practices for NLP tokenization. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern is the potential for loading malicious models if identifiers are untrusted, which is a known supply chain risk but not an active malicious behavior within the code itself. The regex pattern and tokenizer usage are typical and safe. The code's structure is clear, and no suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard NLP utility module with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The only minor risk relates to external model loading from untrusted sources, which should be managed by the user. Overall, the code is safe and well-implemented.",
