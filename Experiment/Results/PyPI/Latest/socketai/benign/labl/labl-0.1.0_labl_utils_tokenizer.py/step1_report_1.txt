{
  "purpose": "Defines various tokenizer classes for text processing, including whitespace, word boundary, and Huggingface tokenizers, along with utility functions for handling tokenization, detokenization, and offsets.",
  "sources": "Inputs include text strings, lists of strings, and tokenizer objects; data is read when tokenizing or detokenizing text and when computing character offsets.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage occurs when token offsets or raw text are exposed; no evidence of data exfiltration or network communication is present.",
  "flows": "Input text -> tokenization (via different tokenizer classes) -> optional gap addition -> offsets computation -> detokenization (if called) -> output tokens or text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides well-defined classes for tokenizing and detokenizing text, with methods for managing token offsets and gaps. It utilizes trusted third-party libraries like transformers and jiwer without executing untrusted code or making network calls. No suspicious or malicious logic, such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or cryptomining, is present. The functions are primarily for text processing, with no signs of sabotage or malware. The only minor concern is the use of assertions that rely on matching token and offset list lengths, which are standard for debugging but do not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate and intended for text tokenization tasks. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or supply chain attacks. It safely leverages third-party libraries for its purpose and does not include hidden or suspicious logic.",
