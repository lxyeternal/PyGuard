  "purpose": "Classes for tokenizing and detokenizing text, supporting multiple tokenization strategies and managing offsets, gaps, and special tokens.",
  "sources": "Input strings for tokenization, external libraries (`transformers`, `re`, `jiwer`) for token processing, and internal methods for offset and gap management.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, network activity, or external data exfiltration observed. No malicious sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input texts are processed through tokenization functions, offsets are computed, gaps are added or removed, and tokens are detokenized. No suspicious data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard NLP tokenization utilities using trusted libraries. It manages offsets, gaps, and special tokens with well-understood methods. Assertions for length matching are standard debugging checks. No network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The code structure is clear, and the logic aligns with typical NLP processing tasks. The security scores from the reports are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation, indicating no malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured NLP utility module with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.1). It is safe for use in supply chain contexts.",
