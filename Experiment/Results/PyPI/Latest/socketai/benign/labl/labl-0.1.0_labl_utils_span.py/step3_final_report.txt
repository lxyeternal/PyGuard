  "purpose": "Define data structures for text spans with serialization and deserialization methods.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; internal class attributes and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "Input data (dicts or sequences) are converted into Span instances via from_dict and from_list methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward data modeling with standard Python features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Span dataclass with attributes for text span annotation, including methods for string representation, conversion to/from dicts, and batch creation from sequences. The SpanList class extends list to hold multiple Span objects with custom string output. There are no external data sources, network calls, or untrusted data handling. The code is simple, clear, and uses standard Python practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for handling text span annotations, with no security risks or malware. All reports correctly identify its safe and straightforward nature. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and minimal security risk are justified.",
