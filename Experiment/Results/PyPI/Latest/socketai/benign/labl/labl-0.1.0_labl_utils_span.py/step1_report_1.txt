  "purpose": "Define data structures and utility methods for representing text spans with labels, including serialization and deserialization functions.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only internal data structures and methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed into sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Conversion from dictionaries to Span objects and from sequences to SpanList.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; standard use of data classes and list subclassing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Span dataclass with attributes for start, end, label, and optional text. It provides methods for string representation, conversion to and from dictionaries, and creation from sequences. The SpanList class extends list with custom string formatting. There are no external inputs, network operations, or data manipulation beyond standard data structure handling. No hardcoded secrets, unsafe code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of span data structures with serialization support. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. It serves purely as utility code for handling labeled text spans.",
