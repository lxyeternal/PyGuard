  "purpose": "Define data structures for representing text spans with attributes and conversion methods.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attributes, and method parameters handling data input such as dictionaries and sequences.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is processed in a way that leads to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Data is initialized from dictionaries or sequences into Span objects, then converted to dicts or string representations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. Code appears standard for data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for text spans with methods for conversion between dicts and class instances, including batch creation. It handles input data as dictionaries or existing instances. No external input handling or network operations are present, reducing risk. No obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious patterns are detected. The code focuses solely on data modeling and representation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, safe implementation of data structures for text span annotation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities.",
