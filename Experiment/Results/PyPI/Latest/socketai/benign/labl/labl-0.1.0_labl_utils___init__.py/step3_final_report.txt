{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific tokenizer classes from a module and defines an export list for the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'labl.utils.tokenizer' (or similar path), which read module components.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network calls, or data leaks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "flows": "Import source to the module namespace; no data flow beyond static import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export setup. No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup importing three classes and defining __all__ for exports. No dynamic execution, no data handling, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns are present. The import path is standard; no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores from reports are consistent with this benign analysis, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores all at 0, and high confidence (1.0). There are no anomalies or issues detected. The code's simplicity and clarity strongly suggest it is safe and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or warnings are necessary.",
