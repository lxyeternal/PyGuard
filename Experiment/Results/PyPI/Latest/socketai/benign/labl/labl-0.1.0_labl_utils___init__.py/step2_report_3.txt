  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: importing three classes from a module and defining an `__all__` list.\n- The import paths differ slightly (e.g., 'labl', 'lablw'), but all are consistent with standard module import statements.\n- The code is static, with no dynamic execution, data handling, or network activity.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The reasoning in all reports is consistent and aligns with standard Python module practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present\n- **Issue presence:** None of the reports indicate any actual issues or anomalies in the code. They all conclude the code is benign and straightforward.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors or flaws are identified. The logic is sound, and the code performs a simple import/export setup.\n\n### Reviewing scores\n- **Confidence:** All reports assign a confidence of 1.0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All scores are 0 or 0.0, which is correct.\n- **Malware:** All scores are 0, which is justified since no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Security risk:** All scores are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5\n- No issues or suspicious behavior justify a higher risk score. The code is standard module setup code with no security concerns.\n\n### Malware score considerations\n- Since no malicious activity is observed or claimed, malware scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n### Challenging assumptions\n- All reports assume the code is benign, which is consistent with the static import and export pattern.\n- The only potential concern could be if the import path is malicious or if the imported classes contain malicious code. However, this cannot be assessed from this snippet alone. Given the context, it's reasonable to assume the import paths are legitimate.\n\n### Consistency of scores\n- All scores are consistent with the code and analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment and recommendations:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward module import/export setup with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are correct in their benign assessment. No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
