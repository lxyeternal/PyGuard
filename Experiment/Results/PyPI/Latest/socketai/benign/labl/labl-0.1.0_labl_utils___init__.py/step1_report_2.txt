{
  "purpose": "The code defines and exports a list of tokenizer classes for use in NLP processing.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'lablw.utils.tokenizer' module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data handling or untrusted input processing present",
  "flows": "Import -> Exported list; no data flow or processing logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import and export of class names",
  "analysis": "The code imports three classes from a module within 'lablw.utils.tokenizer' and exposes them via __all__. There is no data processing, no user input, no network activity, or any suspicious code. The structure is typical for defining exports in a Python module. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple module that imports and exposes tokenizer classes with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
