  "purpose": "This code defines the public API for a module that exports three tokenizer classes for natural language processing.",
  "sources": "The code imports three classes from 'lablw.utils.tokenizer'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or output operations are shown.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes and declares them in __all__, but no data flow occurs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The import path appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific classes from a module and exports them via __all__. It does not process data, execute untrusted input, or perform any operations that could lead to security issues. No malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies are present. This is a straightforward module definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module interface declaration without any malicious intent or security risks.",
