{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the package version of 'labl' using importlib.metadata or fallback to reading pyproject.toml; expose module attributes and export specific classes and utilities.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata for package version; local pyproject.toml file as fallback; module attribute access via __getattr__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processed; no data leaks or external effects; no sinks identified",
  "flows": "Metadata retrieval flows from importlib.metadata or local file; attribute access flows through __getattr__ to version retrieval functions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version retrieval and attribute exposure; no suspicious or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code safely retrieves package version info, handling missing metadata by reading local pyproject.toml, and exposes version info via dynamic attribute access. It imports classes and functions without processing untrusted data or performing network operations. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The fallback to reading local files is standard practice and does not indicate malicious intent. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for package version management and module attribute exposure. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The fallback to local file reading is standard and safe. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
