{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves package version information and exports certain classes and utilities related to datasets and tokenizers.",
  "sources": "Reads its own file system to locate the pyproject.toml file and retrieves package metadata using importlib.metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are evident; no data is sent externally or written insecurely.",
  "flows": "The code reads package information from local files or package metadata, and exposes this information via attribute access.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code dynamically loads version info from local files as fallback.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python library functions and external libraries (toml, importlib.metadata). It includes a function to determine the package version either from installed package metadata or local pyproject.toml file, appending '+' if from local source. It provides attribute access to version info and exports classes related to datasets and tokenizers. No network activity, no code execution, or other malicious behavior is present. The structure and logic are typical for version management modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs benign package version retrieval and exports relevant classes and utilities. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or security risks.",
