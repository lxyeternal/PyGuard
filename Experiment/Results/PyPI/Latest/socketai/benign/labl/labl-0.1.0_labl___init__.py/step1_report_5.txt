{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for retrieving package version information and exposing certain classes and functions for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own metadata via importlib.metadata, the filesystem to locate 'pyproject.toml', and the module's own attributes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code flows from reading package version info to exposing module attributes and constants, with no external input handling or data flow to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, or hidden behavior observed. The version retrieval is straightforward, with fallback to local files if package metadata is absent.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to determine package version via importlib.metadata, with fallback to reading 'pyproject.toml'. It exposes package attributes via __getattr__, and declares public API in __all__. There are no dynamic code executions, no input handling beyond standard package info reading, and no suspicious constructs. The purpose appears to be utility and version management, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code for managing package version info and exposing module components. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are present.",
