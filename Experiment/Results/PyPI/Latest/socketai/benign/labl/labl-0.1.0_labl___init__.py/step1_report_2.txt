{
  "purpose": "The code defines utility functions and imports related to package version management and dataset processing, providing access to version info and dataset/tokenizer classes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version from the installed package metadata or from a local pyproject.toml file.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading package version info from either installed metadata or local configuration files; no untrusted data flows from external sources to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are detected. The version retrieval logic is straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code performs safe imports and defines functions to retrieve package version information. It uses standard library functions and reads local configuration files only if package metadata is unavailable. There is no evidence of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation. The code’s purpose is typical for package modules to report version info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely retrieves package version details and exposes dataset/tokenizer classes, consistent with standard practices.",
