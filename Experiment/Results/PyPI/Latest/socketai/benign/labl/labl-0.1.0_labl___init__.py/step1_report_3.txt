{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to determine and expose the version of the 'labl' package and define exports for module attributes and classes related to datasets and tokenizers.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata via importlib.metadata, reads the pyproject.toml file, and accesses module attributes.",
  "sinks": "None of the data sources directly lead to security-sensitive sinks such as network operations, file writes, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Package version retrieval flows from importlib.metadata or pyproject.toml; attribute access flows from __getattr__ to version functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code uses standard Python modules and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package version detection, falling back on reading a local pyproject.toml if the package is not found in the environment. It defines a mechanism to expose package attributes dynamically, which is typical for versioning. There are no suspicious code patterns, no network calls, no data exfiltration, or malicious logic. The code operates in a read-only manner, focusing on metadata extraction and module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning to retrieve package version info and define module exports. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
