{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to retrieve and expose package metadata, specifically the version, and to define some dataset and tokenizer classes for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the importlib.metadata module, the filesystem (pyproject.toml), and the module's own attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data in a way that could lead to data leaks or execution of malicious code.",
  "flows": "The code flows from package/version retrieval functions to attribute access, but there are no external untrusted data flows or dangerous data manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are detected. The version retrieval logic is standard and handles missing metadata gracefully.",
  "analysis": "The script's primary function is to determine and expose its package version, attempting to do so via importlib.metadata or fallback to reading pyproject.toml. It employs straightforward error handling and does not execute untrusted data or perform network operations. The structure and use of standard libraries suggest typical package metadata handling without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for package version retrieval and module attribute management, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and purposefully designed for its metadata functions.",
