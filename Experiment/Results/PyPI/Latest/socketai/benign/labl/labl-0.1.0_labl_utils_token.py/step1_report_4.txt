{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures and utility functions for handling labeled tokens, likely for NLP tasks, including conversion from various input formats.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read within this code; it operates on provided data structures.",
  "sinks": "There are no functions or operations in the code that send data over networks, write to files, or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "The methods convert input data structures (tuples, lists, objects) into internal `LabeledToken` objects, with some filtering based on labels.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior, are present. The code performs straightforward data processing and formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a type definition for labeled token inputs and a class `LabeledToken` with methods for creation, string representation, and batch conversion from various formats. The `LabeledTokenList` class extends list to provide custom string formatting. There are no network operations, file I/O, or code injection mechanisms. The code appears to be a standard data handling utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign utility code for managing labeled token data structures, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
