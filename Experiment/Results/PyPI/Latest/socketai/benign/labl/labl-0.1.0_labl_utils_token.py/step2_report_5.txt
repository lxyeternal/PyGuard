  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior.\n- The code is primarily data modeling and transformation for labeled tokens, with no external system interaction, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- The only notable logic involves filtering labels in `from_list`, which is a common pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code appears correct and does not contain any errors or vulnerabilities.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The logic for label filtering is standard and does not raise concerns.\n- No external data sources or sinks are present, and no suspicious behaviors are evident.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are identified in the code.\n- The only minor point is the use of `list[...]` syntax, which requires Python 3.9+; assuming environment compatibility, this is acceptable.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, as there is no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0.0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The reports are consistent; no need to adjust scores.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The `from_list` method's label filtering logic is standard and not suspicious.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified; the code is safe.\n- The code does not perform any external calls, network operations, or contain hidden behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0.0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n**Risk score:** 0.0\n\nThe code is a benign utility for handling labeled tokens, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their benign assessment. The code is safe, straightforward, and well-structured. No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure environment compatibility with newer syntax features like `list[...]`.",
