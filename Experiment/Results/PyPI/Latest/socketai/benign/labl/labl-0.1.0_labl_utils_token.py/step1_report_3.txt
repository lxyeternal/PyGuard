{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and utility methods for handling labeled tokens, typically used in NLP tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, defines classes, methods, and type annotations; no external data input or output operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data, network, or system operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows within class methods, such as transforming tuples/lists into LabeledToken objects, but no external or malicious data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic detected. The code is straightforward and for data handling only.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data types, parsing, and conversion methods for labeled tokens in NLP tasks. It includes safe type checking, conversion methods, and a custom string representation. There are no external I/O, network operations, or potentially malicious constructs. The structure and functions are typical for such data classes, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for handling labeled token data in NLP. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, and its purpose appears benign and aligned with typical data processing workflows.",
