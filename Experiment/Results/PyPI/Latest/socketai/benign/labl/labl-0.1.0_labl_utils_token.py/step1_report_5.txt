  "purpose": "Define data structures and methods for handling labeled tokens, including conversion from tuples/lists and string representation.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; class methods convert input data to internal objects.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or external data outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input data (tuples, lists) flows through 'from_list' method to create 'LabeledToken' objects.",
  "anomalies": "None; code appears to be straightforward data handling without suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'LabeledToken' class and associated list subclass for handling labeled tokens, with methods for creation, string representation, and filtering. The 'from_list' method processes input data, allowing filtering based on labels. No external data sources or sinks are evident. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code relies solely on standard Python features and simple data manipulations. The overall structure and logic are clear and typical for data modeling in NLP tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for handling labeled tokens in NLP contexts, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
