  "purpose": "Utility for handling labeled tokens in NLP tasks, including data conversion, filtering, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Input data in the form of lists or tuples containing tokens and labels.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data exfiltration points; purely in-memory data processing.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed in 'from_list' to create 'LabeledToken' instances, filtered based on labels, then stored in 'LabeledTokenList' for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with standard Python features. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes and utility functions for NLP token labeling. 'from_list' filters labels based on provided keep and ignore lists, which is standard. String representations are for visualization. No external calls, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for NLP token labeling with no security risks or malicious intent. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
