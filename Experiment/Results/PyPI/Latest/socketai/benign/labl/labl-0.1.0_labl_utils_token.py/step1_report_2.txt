{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and utility functions for handling labeled tokens, primarily for NLP tasks.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; the code uses input parameters for methods like `from_list`.",
  "sinks": "No direct output sinks that could leak data or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Input data is transformed within methods, with no untrusted data flow to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code constructs. The code appears standard and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass `LabeledToken` and a list subclass `LabeledTokenList` for handling tokens with labels. The methods perform data conversion, filtering, and string representation. No external system calls, network operations, or obfuscated code are present. The functions involve type checking and label filtering, which are standard procedures. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data structure implementation for NLP token labeling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
