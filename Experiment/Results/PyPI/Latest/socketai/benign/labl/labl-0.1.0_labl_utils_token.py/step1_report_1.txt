{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures and utility functions for handling labeled tokens, likely for NLP or data annotation tasks.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources are present; the code defines classes and type annotations. It uses standard library imports and a custom import (`labl.utils.typing.LabelType`).",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks or data output functions that handle untrusted input or data transmission. No external calls or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code creates and manipulates `LabeledToken` instances from input lists or tuples, applying label filtering and conversion. There are no external or network flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code are evident. The code does not contain obfuscated or suspicious logic, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. The class and function structures are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides data models and methods for processing labeled token data. It imports standard modules and a custom type, with no external system interactions or dynamic code execution. The `from_list` method filters labels based on keep and ignore lists, but this is a typical filtering pattern. No hardcoded credentials, system modifications, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for handling labeled tokens, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs data transformations and formatting without external or sensitive data handling. Overall, it is a safe and standard implementation.",
