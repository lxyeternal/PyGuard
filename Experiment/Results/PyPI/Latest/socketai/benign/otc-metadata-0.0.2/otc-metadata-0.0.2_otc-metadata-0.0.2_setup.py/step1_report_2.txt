{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with a custom install command that outputs a message to a file during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the setuptools package, the install command class, and executes os.system() during the run method.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executes a shell command that writes to a file in /tmp directory.",
  "flows": "During installation, the run() method triggers os.system(), which writes a message to /tmp/seasides2025_pypi_poc.txt.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() to execute a shell command during installation; the command writes a static message to a temp file. No actual malicious code or data exfiltration, but executing shell commands in setup scripts can be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script extends the install command to run a custom method that executes a shell command, writing a message to a temporary file. This behavior is unusual for typical package installation and could be used for side effects or malicious purposes, such as leaving a marker or exfiltrating data. The message appears to be a placeholder or proof of concept, with no evident malicious payload or data theft. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or other malicious indicators. The use of os.system() during install is uncommon and could be exploited for malicious intent, but in this context, it seems benign. However, executing arbitrary shell commands in setup scripts is generally discouraged.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple side effect during installation by writing a message to a temp file. There is no clear malicious behavior, but the use of os.system() in a setup script is unusual and potentially risky. It does not appear to contain malware or significant security risks, but it is a suspicious pattern that warrants caution.",
