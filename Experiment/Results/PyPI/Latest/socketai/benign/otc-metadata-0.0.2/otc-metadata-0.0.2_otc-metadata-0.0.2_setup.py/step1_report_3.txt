{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup configuration with a custom install command.",
  "sources": "The code imports from setuptools and defines a custom install command class; the run() method executes a system command.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executes a shell command that writes to a file in /tmp, which could be a way to demonstrate code execution or a placeholder.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run() method is invoked, executing os.system(), which writes a string to /tmp/seasides2025_pypi_poc.txt.",
  "anomalies": "The os.system() command is used to write a message to a temporary file during installation, which could be benign or a placeholder. No hardcoded credentials or data leakage observed. The message appears to be a demonstration statement rather than malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports setuptools and extends the install command to execute an os.system() call that writes a specific message to a file in /tmp. This behavior occurs during package installation, which is unusual for typical setup scripts and may be intended as a proof of concept or demonstration. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors like data exfiltration or network communication are present. The code is simple and appears non-malicious, likely serving as a placeholder or example.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes a benign command during installation, likely as a placeholder or demo. No malicious intent detected, though executing system commands during install is generally discouraged unless necessary. Overall, this appears to be a minimal demonstration with no malicious behavior.",
