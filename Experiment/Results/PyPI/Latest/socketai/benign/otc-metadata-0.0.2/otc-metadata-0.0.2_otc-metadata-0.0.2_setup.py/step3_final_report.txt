{
  "purpose": "The code executes a shell command during package installation to write a message to a temporary file, likely for demonstration or placeholder purposes.",
  "sources": "The run() method in PostInstallCommand calls os.system() to execute 'echo ... > /tmp/seasides2025_pypi_poc.txt'.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executes a shell command that writes to /tmp, which could be exploited for arbitrary command execution if the command were dynamic.",
  "flows": "Source: run() method invoking os.system(); Sink: shell command writing to /tmp file.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of an arbitrary shell command during setup, which is unconventional and potentially risky; no obfuscation or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, during execution, runs a shell command to write a message to a file in /tmp. This pattern is unusual for setup scripts and can be exploited if the command is dynamic or malicious. However, in this static form, it appears benign and likely intended as a demonstration. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The use of os.system() in setup scripts is discouraged but not inherently malicious. The behavior does not indicate malicious intent or sabotage, just an unconventional side effect.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes a benign shell command during installation, likely for demonstration purposes. There is no evidence of malicious activity or payloads. The pattern of executing commands in setup scripts is suspicious but not malicious in this context. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a risk score around 0.1 to 0.2.",
