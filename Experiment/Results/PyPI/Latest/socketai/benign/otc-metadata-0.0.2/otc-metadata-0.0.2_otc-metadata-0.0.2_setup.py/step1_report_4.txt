  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with a custom install command.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata and runs a custom command during installation.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a command that writes to a file, which could be a side effect, but not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method is executed, triggering the os.system call.",
  "anomalies": "The os.system command writes a message to a file in /tmp during install, which is unusual and may be unnecessary. No user input or untrusted data is involved.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the standard setuptools install command with a custom run method. This method executes a shell command that writes a message to a temporary file. While this is not malicious by itself, embedding side effects like writing to /tmp during installation without clear purpose could be considered suspicious or undesirable behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or obfuscated code. The command appears to be a demo or placeholder message. The package metadata is minimal and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes a benign side effect during installation, likely for demonstration purposes. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior but exhibits an unusual side effect that warrants caution in production environments.",
