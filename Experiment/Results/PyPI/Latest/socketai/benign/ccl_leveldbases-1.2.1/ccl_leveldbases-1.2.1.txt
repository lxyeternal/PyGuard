      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for database file parsing and analysis. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The primary security concern is resource exhaustion via crafted decompression data, which is a standard risk and not indicative of malicious intent. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is justified by the inherent risks of decompressing untrusted data, but does not reflect malicious activity."
