  "purpose": "The code attempts to perform a relative import from the 'area' module using wildcard syntax.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no other data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow or execution occurs in this static import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The syntax `import .area import *` is invalid in Python; correct syntax should be `from .area import *`. This syntax error is a critical anomaly that prevents code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a syntax error that invalidates execution, which is a fundamental flaw. The reports correctly identify the use of wildcard and relative import syntax but overlook the invalid syntax. Since the code cannot run, there is no malicious activity or security risk. The malware score should be 0, and the security risk score should also be 0, reflecting the syntax error rather than malicious intent. Confidence in this conclusion is high, as the syntax error is clear and unambiguous. No obfuscation is present. The primary concern is code correctness, not security.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet is syntactically invalid in Python, which is a critical flaw. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this static import statement. The scores should be adjusted to reflect the invalid syntax, with malware and security risk scores set to 0. The reports should highlight this syntax error as a primary issue, and the overall security assessment indicates no threat.",
