  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the module '.area' within the current package or directory.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is the source, importing from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; this line does not directly execute untrusted code or handle data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident from this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a relative import with a wildcard (*) can sometimes indicate obfuscation or incomplete code, but by itself, it is not suspicious. No other unusual patterns or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a single import operation from a relative module '.area' using a wildcard. This pattern is common in package modules to include multiple functions or variables from a submodule. No malicious behavior or security risks are directly apparent in this statement. It does not execute any code or handle untrusted data; it merely imports symbols. Without additional context, this line alone does not suggest malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is simple and standard within Python packages. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks based solely on this line. Additional code would be needed to perform a more comprehensive assessment.",
