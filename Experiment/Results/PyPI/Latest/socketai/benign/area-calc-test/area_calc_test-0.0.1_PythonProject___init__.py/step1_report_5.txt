{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a relative import statement intended to include contents from the 'area' module or package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which loads the 'area' module or package.",
  "sinks": "This statement does not contain any direct data sinks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; this is just an import statement without further code or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The import syntax uses a relative import with a wildcard ('*'), which is generally discouraged due to potential namespace pollution. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or code obfuscation from this line alone.",
  "analysis": "The line is a relative import from the current package/module, importing all symbols from 'area'. No data input, output, or execution of untrusted code is evident here. The code is minimal and standard in structure. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are detected beyond the minor concern of using a wildcard import, which can be considered a bad practice but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard relative import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a minimal import line and does not pose a security threat by itself.",
