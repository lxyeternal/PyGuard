  "purpose": "Calculate the area of geometric figures (circle and triangle) based on provided parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters via **kwargs for figure dimensions (radius, sides). No external input reading; data is passed through function arguments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data is sent over network, stored insecurely, or written to files. No use of untrusted sources or external data streams.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the instantiation of the class with parameters to the calculation methods; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code handles errors locally with print statements but does not include obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an 'Area' class with an 'calc_area' method that computes areas for circles and triangles based on parameters. It performs basic mathematical calculations with standard Python math library functions. Error handling is limited to printing messages without propagating exceptions or logging. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is straightforward, with clear logic and no obfuscated elements or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This source code performs legitimate geometric calculations with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is simple, well-structured, and does not contain any malicious behavior or vulnerabilities that threaten security.",
