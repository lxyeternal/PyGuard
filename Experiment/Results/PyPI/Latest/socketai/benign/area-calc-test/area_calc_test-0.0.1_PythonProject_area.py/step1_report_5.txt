  "purpose": "Calculate the area of different geometric figures based on provided parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in kwargs for figure type and dimensions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is sent to external systems or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are read from kwargs; calculations use math functions; no external data flow or untrusted output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution. The code performs straightforward mathematical calculations with proper exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for calculating areas of figures, handling input parameters securely with exception handling. It uses the math library for calculations and does not interact with external systems or perform suspicious operations. No malicious logic, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system manipulation, is present. The structure is clear, and the code's purpose is legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It safely performs geometric calculations without external interactions or security risks.",
