  "purpose": "Calculate the area of geometric figures (circle, triangle) based on provided parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters provided via **kwargs during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not write to external systems or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (**kwargs) to calculations within calc_area().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code performs straightforward calculations with exception handling for missing data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Area class for computing areas of circles and triangles. It uses math module functions securely. Input parameters are passed dynamically and used locally without external influence. No network operations, file manipulations, or environment variable usage are present. The exception handling is standard and does not introduce security issues. The code does not contain obfuscated constructs or malicious behavior. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard geometric calculator with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely processes input parameters for area calculations and handles missing or invalid data appropriately.",
