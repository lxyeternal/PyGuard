  "purpose": "Calculate the area of different geometric figures based on input parameters",
  "sources": "Input parameters via **kwargs for figure type and dimensions",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data being sent to external systems or storage",
  "flows": "Input data from **kwargs used directly in calculations within calc_area()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures; no dynamic execution or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for calculating areas of shapes, with input parameters provided through **kwargs. It performs straightforward mathematical calculations for circles and triangles, including basic validation. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or system manipulations are present. No signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior are detected. The exception handling is minimal but standard, and no unusual or obfuscated code structures are used.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for geometric calculations without any malicious behavior or security risks. It neither contains malware nor shows signs of supply chain attack vectors.",
