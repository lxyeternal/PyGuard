  "purpose": "Calculate the area of different geometric figures based on provided parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters via kwargs (e.g., 'r' for radius, 'a', 'b', 'c' for triangle sides).",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data manipulation or data leak sources identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used directly in calculations; no untrusted data flows into system commands or sensitive outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected. Use of standard math functions and straightforward control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for computing areas of basic geometric figures. It accepts figure type and dimensions as kwargs. Calculations are straightforward, with error handling for missing parameters. No dynamic code execution, network access, or insecure operations are present. The implementation appears standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors. The only potential concern is printing error messages, which is benign in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple area calculations with basic input validation. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code appears safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.",
