  "purpose": "Calculate areas of circles and triangles based on provided parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters via kwargs for radius and triangle sides.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; calculations are internal and safe.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from kwargs to calculation formulas; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal error handling with print statements; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of geometric area calculations with standard math functions. It handles missing parameters with print statements and performs basic validation for triangle sides. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The logic is correct, and no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. Error handling could be improved by raising exceptions, but this does not impact security. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It functions as a simple utility for geometric calculations. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (0.1) are appropriate; however, setting the security risk to 0 would be even more conservative and justified.",
