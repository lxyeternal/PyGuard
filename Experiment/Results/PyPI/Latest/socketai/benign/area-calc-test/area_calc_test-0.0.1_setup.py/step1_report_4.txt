  "purpose": "Defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'area_calc_test'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file to obtain long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data, no data leaks or insecure data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reads the README file, then executes setup() to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module. It reads a README file for documentation, specifies package details, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious activity is present. External URL links appear legitimate, and dependencies are standard. No source-to-sink data flows indicate potential security issues. The code structure is straightforward and consistent with common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
