The reports should highlight this syntax error as a primary issue, and the overall security assessment indicates no threat."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It functions as a simple utility for geometric calculations. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (0.1) are appropriate; however, setting the security risk to 0 would be even more conservative and justified."
