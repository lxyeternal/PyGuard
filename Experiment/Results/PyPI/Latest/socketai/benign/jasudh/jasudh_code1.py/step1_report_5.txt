  "purpose": "Data analysis and visualization of housing data, model training and evaluation for price prediction.",
  "sources": "Reading CSV file 'USA_Housing.csv' using pandas.read_csv.",
  "sinks": "No data is written or transmitted externally; no sensitive data handling observed beyond reading the CSV.",
  "flows": "CSV data read -> data processed for visualization and modeling -> predictions and evaluations performed locally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. No obfuscation or obfuscated code elements.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard data loading, visualization, feature selection, train-test split, linear regression modeling, prediction, and evaluation. It uses common libraries without any suspicious or malicious functions. No inputs are taken from or outputs sent to external sources aside from reading a CSV file; no network connections or system commands are invoked. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with typical data science workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, focused on housing data analysis and modeling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It solely processes data locally for predictive modeling.",
