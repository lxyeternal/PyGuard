{
  "purpose": "The code performs exploratory data analysis and linear regression modeling on a housing dataset to predict house prices.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV file 'USA_Housing.csv' to load data; no other external data inputs or user inputs are read during execution.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include printed error metrics and plots displayed via matplotlib; no data is written to external locations or transmitted over network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reading ('pd.read_csv') into data processing, then into model training, prediction, and visualization. No external data or untrusted input flows into sensitive sinks such as system commands or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual control flows. The code is straightforward for data analysis and modeling.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a dataset, performs exploratory data analysis with plots, splits data into training and test sets, trains a linear regression model, makes predictions, and evaluates the model. All operations are standard for data science workflows. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data analysis and machine learning script with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is safe in the context of supply chain security.",
