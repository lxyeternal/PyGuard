  "purpose": "Standard data analysis and modeling pipeline: loading data, visualization, feature selection, train-test split, linear regression, prediction, and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Reading 'USA_Housing.csv' file from local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network activity, or untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "Data loaded from CSV → processed and visualized → features selected → split into train/test → model trained → predictions made → evaluation metrics computed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries (pandas, seaborn, sklearn, matplotlib) for data analysis and modeling. It performs typical ML tasks without any network activity, external data leaks, or malicious code. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The data source is a local CSV file, and the code does not handle untrusted inputs or outputs. The scoring in the original reports assigns malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (mostly 0, with one report at 0.1), which aligns with the benign nature of the code. The code's straightforward structure and lack of external communication indicate no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The original reports' assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's content. No further modifications or warnings are necessary.",
