  "purpose": "The code loads housing data, performs exploratory data analysis, trains a linear regression model, and evaluates its performance.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'USA_Housing.csv'; imports libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data leading to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Reads data from CSV -> Data analysis -> Model training and prediction -> Visualization -> Evaluation metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network connections, or unusual code patterns. All imports and functions are standard for data analysis and modeling.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical data science tasks: loading data, visualizing, training a model, and evaluating results. There are no indications of malicious intent such as network communication, code obfuscation, or backdoors. The code uses standard libraries and functions with clear purposes. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data analysis and modeling script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard in structure and function, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
