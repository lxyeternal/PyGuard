{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform exploratory data analysis and regression modeling on a housing dataset to predict house prices.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the file 'USA_Housing.csv' using pandas.read_csv.",
  "targets": "The code does not contain any evident untrusted data sinks such as network transmission, file modification, or sensitive data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the CSV file into pandas, then into visualization and modeling functions. There are no data flows that lead to untrusted or malicious sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code constructs are present. The code uses standard data analysis and modeling libraries without obfuscation or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a dataset, performs exploratory visualizations (pairplot, histograms), computes correlations, splits data for training/testing, fits a linear regression model, makes predictions, and evaluates model performance with standard metrics. All operations are typical for data analysis and machine learning workflows. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or malicious code patterns. No use of eval, exec, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code is detected. The code appears clean, standard, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard data analysis and machine learning tasks without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical, benign script for predictive modeling. No indicators of malware or malicious behavior are present.",
