  "purpose": "The code is intended for analyzing housing data, visualizing relationships, training a linear regression model, and evaluating its performance.",
  "sources": "Data is loaded from a CSV file named 'USA_Housing.csv'. No other data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks that process untrusted data in a security-sensitive manner; it only performs data analysis and model training locally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame, then through feature selection, train-test splitting, model fitting, prediction, and evaluation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. All operations are standard data analysis and machine learning procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script performs data loading, visualization, feature selection, train-test splitting, model training, prediction, and evaluation. There are no indications of malicious intent, suspicious data handling, or obfuscated code. Usage of common libraries and straightforward code structure suggest normal behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data analysis and modeling script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely processes local data and performs typical ML tasks.",
