{
  "purpose": "This code trains, evaluates, and visualizes a sentiment analysis model using the IMDB dataset with TensorFlow and Keras.",
  "sources": "The code loads the IMDB dataset via tf.keras.datasets.imdb.load_data.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include printed classification report, evaluation metrics, and plots for training history, confusion matrix, and training process.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading to preprocessing, then into model training, evaluation, prediction, and visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard libraries and functions without suspicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries (TensorFlow, matplotlib, sklearn, numpy). It loads the IMDB dataset directly from TensorFlow's dataset module, processes the data with padding, builds an LSTM-based sentiment analysis model, trains for 5 epochs, evaluates on test data, predicts probabilities, and displays metrics and visualizations. All steps utilize conventional practices without hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or hidden behavior. The data flow and functions follow standard patterns for model training and evaluation. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for sentiment analysis using TensorFlow with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely performs model training, evaluation, and visualization using publicly available datasets and libraries.",
