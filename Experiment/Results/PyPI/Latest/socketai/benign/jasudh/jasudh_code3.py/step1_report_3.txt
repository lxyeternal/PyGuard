{
  "purpose": "Build, train, evaluate, and visualize a sentiment analysis model using TensorFlow and related libraries.",
  "sources": "Loading IMDB dataset with tf.keras.datasets.imdb.load_data, reading seed value with tf.random.set_seed, and plotting with matplotlib.pyplot.",
  "sinks": "Model training and evaluation, prediction generation, and visualization functions do not directly handle untrusted input or output sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Input data from load_data flows through padding, then into the model for training and evaluation; predictions flow from model.predict to analysis and visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed; code appears standard for a machine learning workflow.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical TensorFlow Keras implementation for sentiment analysis using the IMDb dataset. It sets a seed for reproducibility, loads data, processes it, constructs a neural network model with embedding and LSTM layers, trains the model, evaluates performance, and visualizes results. No suspicious or malicious functions, data leaks, or backdoors are present. The code does not read from or write to untrusted sources, nor does it perform network connections or system modifications. The use of standard libraries and datasets suggests a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard machine learning pipeline for sentiment classification with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs data loading, preprocessing, modeling, and visualization in a typical manner. No malware or security vulnerabilities are identified.",
