{
  "purpose": "The code implements a sentiment analysis pipeline using TensorFlow and Keras, loading the IMDB dataset, preprocessing it, building an LSTM-based neural network, training, evaluating, and visualizing results.",
  "sources": "Dataset loaded via tf.keras.datasets.imdb.load_data; data is preprocessed through padding sequences.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include evaluation metrics, predictions, and plots; no external or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading, through preprocessing, model training, evaluation, prediction, and visualization steps.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard sentiment analysis implementation using TensorFlow and Keras, with clear structure and trusted libraries. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. It does not perform any external network communication, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted input beyond dataset loading. The code is straightforward, with no anomalies or obfuscation, and adheres to common ML practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard machine learning script for sentiment analysis with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the detailed analysis.",
