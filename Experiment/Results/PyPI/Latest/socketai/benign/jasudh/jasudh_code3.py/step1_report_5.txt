{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load, preprocess, train, and evaluate an IMDb movie review sentiment analysis model using TensorFlow/Keras.",
  "sources": "Data loading from tf.keras.datasets.imdb.load_data(), reading input data, and model predictions.",
  "sinks": "Model prediction output, visualization functions (plt.show()), and print statements for reports.",
  "flows": "Data loaded from dataset -> model trained -> predictions made -> evaluation outputs generated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior observed. Use of standard libraries and methods consistent with common ML workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard TensorFlow, Keras, matplotlib, and sklearn libraries. Data is loaded from a trusted source (tf.keras.datasets), and the model is built using common layers (Embedding, LSTM, Dense). There is no use of untrusted input, no dynamic execution, and no network communications or system modifications observed. Visualization functions are used solely for plotting training history and confusion matrix. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors identified. The script appears to be a straightforward ML pipeline.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard implementation of a sentiment analysis model using TensorFlow/Keras with data visualization. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. It is a typical example of an ML workflow with no security concerns identified.",
