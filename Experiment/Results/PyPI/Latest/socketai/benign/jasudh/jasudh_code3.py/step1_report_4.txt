{
  "purpose": "The code loads the IMDB movie review dataset, preprocesses it, builds and trains a sentiment analysis model using TensorFlow, and visualizes the results.",
  "sources": "Data is loaded via tf.keras.datasets.imdb.load_data, model training and evaluation are performed on this data, and visualizations are generated using matplotlib.",
  "sinks": "Predictions are made with model.predict, and results are printed and plotted, but no data leaks or insecure data handling are observed.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from TensorFlow's dataset API, processed in memory, passed through model training, and predictions are generated from test data, then results are displayed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code uses standard libraries and functions for dataset loading, preprocessing, modeling, and visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code follows a typical machine learning workflow: data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization. All steps use standard, reputable libraries without suspicious or malicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity is present. The data handling appears safe and standard, and no hardcoded secrets or potentially malicious actions are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign machine learning script intended for sentiment analysis using TensorFlow. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It relies solely on standard libraries and datasets for typical ML tasks.",
