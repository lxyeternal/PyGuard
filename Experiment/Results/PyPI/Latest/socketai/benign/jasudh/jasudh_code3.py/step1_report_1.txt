  "purpose": "Train and evaluate an IMDb sentiment analysis model using TensorFlow and Keras.",
  "sources": "Loading dataset from tf.keras.datasets.imdb.load_data, setting random seed with tf.random.set_seed.",
  "sinks": "Model training, evaluation, and prediction outputs. No untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input data from load_data flows into padding, then into model training, evaluation, and prediction steps. No external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed. All code appears standard for ML workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries for deep learning, data visualization, and metrics calculation. It loads the IMDB dataset via TensorFlow's built-in function, applies standard preprocessing, builds a typical LSTM-based sentiment classifier, and performs evaluation and visualization. No external network connections, system commands, or suspicious activity observed. The data flow is straightforward, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical machine learning script for sentiment analysis; it does not contain malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware signals identified.",
