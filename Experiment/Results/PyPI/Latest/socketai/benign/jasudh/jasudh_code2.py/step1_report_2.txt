{
  "purpose": "The code loads the MNIST dataset, preprocesses it, builds, trains, and evaluates a CNN model for digit classification.",
  "sources": "Data is loaded from tensorflow.keras.datasets (mnist.load_data()), which is a trusted library source; user input is not involved.",
  "sinks": "Model training, evaluation, and plotting functions; no data is sent over network or written to external systems; outputs are plots and printed metrics.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading to preprocessing, into model training, and then into evaluation and visualization. No untrusted input flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard data loading, normalization, model building with Keras, training, and evaluation. All library imports are from well-known sources. No external or untrusted data inputs are processed. No network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications are evident. The code structure aligns with typical ML workflows. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a MNIST classifier using TensorFlow and Keras, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
