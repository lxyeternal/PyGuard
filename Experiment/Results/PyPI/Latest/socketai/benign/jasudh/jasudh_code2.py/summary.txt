  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of an MNIST classifier with no malicious or suspicious elements. The security risk and malware scores should be 0, and the obfuscated score should also be 0. The slight elevation in one report's security risk score (0.1) is unnecessary given the benign nature of the code."
