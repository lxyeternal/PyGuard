{
  "purpose": "The code trains and evaluates a CNN model on the MNIST dataset for digit classification.",
  "sources": "The code loads data from tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist, uses tf and keras APIs for data processing, model building, training, and evaluation.",
  "sinks": "The code performs predictions and displays plots; no sinks are identified that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading to normalization, reshaping, encoding, then into model training, and finally to evaluation and visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs standard ML tasks without hidden or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical MNIST digit classifier implementation using TensorFlow/Keras. It loads the dataset, preprocesses it, constructs a CNN, trains for 5 epochs, evaluates, and visualizes results. No suspicious data flows, obfuscated code, or malicious actions are detected. It does not contain network communications, file system manipulation, or secret handling. It appears to be a legitimate ML example without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard machine learning script for image classification with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely within the scope of data processing, model training, and evaluation. No malicious or suspicious elements are identified.",
