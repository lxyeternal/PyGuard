{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load the MNIST dataset, build, train, and evaluate a convolutional neural network classifier for digit recognition.",
  "sources": "The code loads data using mnist.load_data(), reads data from the dataset, and uses user-supplied input data during training and testing.",
  "sinks": "Model training and evaluation, prediction outputs, and visualization display (confusion matrix, classification report). No untrusted data is written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from the MNIST dataset, processed, fed into the model for training, then predictions are made on test data, leading to evaluation and visualization outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. Usage of standard libraries and functions is typical for ML workflows. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard machine learning tasks: data loading, preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation. It uses TensorFlow/Keras libraries as intended, with no suspicious network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The visualization and evaluation steps are routine for such tasks. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and relies solely on open-source ML libraries and datasets.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a MNIST digit classifier. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a typical machine learning example script.",
