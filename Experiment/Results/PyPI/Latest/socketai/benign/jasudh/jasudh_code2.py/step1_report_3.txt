  "purpose": "Train and evaluate a CNN model for classifying MNIST handwritten digits.",
  "sources": "mnist.load_data() for dataset loading; user input not explicitly present.",
  "sinks": "Model training and evaluation functions; no untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded, preprocessed, fed into the model for training, then predictions are made on test data, with results visualized and evaluated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads the MNIST dataset, preprocesses images and labels, constructs a convolutional neural network using Keras, compiles, trains the model, and evaluates its performance. All operations are standard for image classification tasks. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and well-structured, with no obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical machine learning pipeline for MNIST digit classification. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. All code appears benign and aligned with standard practices.",
