{
  "purpose": "The code implements a standard convolutional neural network to classify MNIST handwritten digits using TensorFlow/Keras, involving data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Data is loaded from trusted Keras datasets; no external untrusted input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include model evaluation metrics and visualizations; no external data exfiltration or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading through preprocessing to model training and evaluation; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code follows a typical ML pipeline with standard library usage, no suspicious behaviors, external communications, or malicious code. It processes trusted data, trains a model, and visualizes results without any anomalies or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of an MNIST classifier with no malicious or suspicious elements. The security risk and malware scores should be 0, and the obfuscated score should also be 0. The slight elevation in one report's security risk score (0.1) is unnecessary given the benign nature of the code.",
