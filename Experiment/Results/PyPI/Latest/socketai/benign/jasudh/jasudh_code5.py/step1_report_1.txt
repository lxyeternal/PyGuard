{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for sentiment analysis using a pre-trained neural network model on text data, including data loading, model training, evaluation, saving, and applying sentiment analysis to a network graph's nodes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from IMDB dataset, loads model and tokenizer files from disk, reads text attributes from graph nodes, and loads saved models and tokenizers.",
  "sinks": "Writes model and tokenizer files to disk, updates graph node attributes with sentiment labels.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading to model training, evaluation, then saving; and from graph node texts to tokenizer, to model prediction, and back to graph node attribute updates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard use of libraries for NLP tasks, model persistence, and graph attribute handling. No hardcoded secrets, malicious network calls, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses common libraries (Keras, TensorFlow, NetworkX, pickle) for sentiment analysis, with straightforward data flow: loading data, training a model, saving the model and tokenizer, then applying the model to graph node texts. It includes data evaluation and visualization steps. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious network activity detected. All file operations are typical for model persistence. The functions and main execution flow align with legitimate machine learning practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate sentiment analysis pipeline without malicious intent. It handles model training, evaluation, and inference, and saves artifacts appropriately. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident.",
