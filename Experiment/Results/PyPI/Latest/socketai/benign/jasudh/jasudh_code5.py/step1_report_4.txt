  "purpose": "The code performs sentiment analysis on text data using a neural network model trained on IMDb movie reviews, then applies this model to annotate nodes in a NetworkX graph with sentiment labels.",
  "sources": "Reads IMDb dataset through keras.datasets.imdb.load_data; loads saved model 'sentiment_rnn_model.h5'; loads tokenizer 'tokenizer.pickle'; reads node attributes 'text' from a NetworkX graph.",
  "sinks": "Uses model.predict() to generate sentiment probabilities; assigns sentiment labels to graph nodes; saves model and tokenizer files.",
  "flows": "Loads data and models -> processes text data -> predicts sentiment -> annotates graph nodes with sentiment labels.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscated code detected. The code follows standard data science and NLP practices without suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads the IMDb dataset and preprocesses it for training a sentiment analysis model using Keras with an Embedding, LSTM, and Dense layers. It trains and evaluates the model, then saves the trained model and tokenizer to disk. The 'perform_sentiment_analysis' function loads a saved model and tokenizer to predict sentiment labels on node texts in a NetworkX graph. The main block creates a sample graph, performs sentiment analysis, and prints sentiment distributions. All file operations are standard, and no suspicious or malicious activity is detected. The code uses common libraries for machine learning and network analysis, with no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The only notable behavior is the model prediction and graph annotation, which is typical for NLP workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard sentiment analysis pipeline utilizing pre-trained models and graph annotations. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are evident. It appears to be a legitimate implementation for NLP tasks with standard data handling and model operations.",
