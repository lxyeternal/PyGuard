{
  "purpose": "The code trains a sentiment analysis model using IMDB dataset, saves the model and tokenizer, and provides a function to perform sentiment analysis on nodes of a NetworkX graph based on text data.",
  "sources": "Reads IMDB dataset from keras.datasets, loads saved model and tokenizer files from disk, reads 'text' attributes from graph nodes, loads model via load_model, loads tokenizer via pickle",
  "sinks": "Model prediction step (model.predict), file I/O for loading model ('sentiment_rnn_model.h5') and tokenizer ('tokenizer.pickle'), writing sentiment attributes to graph nodes",
  "flows": "Reads dataset from keras datasets -> loads model and tokenizer -> processes text from graph nodes -> predicts sentiment -> attaches sentiment label to nodes",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard data processing, model training, saving, and inference code are used. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical machine learning workflow: loading data, defining and training an LSTM-based sentiment model, evaluating, saving model and tokenizer, and performing inference on graph node text attributes. All file I/O operations are straightforward. The perform_sentiment_analysis function loads a saved model and tokenizer to classify node texts, appending sentiment labels. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious network activity. The code's structure and functions are standard for a sentiment analysis pipeline.",
  "conclusion": "The script implements a legitimate sentiment analysis model workflow without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It uses standard libraries and practices. No indicators of malware or security risks are present.",
