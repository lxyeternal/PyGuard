      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate sentiment analysis pipeline with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the code's operations. Overall, the code appears safe and trustworthy."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard image classification pipeline with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores of malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified based on the analysis."

      "confidence": 0.7,
      "conclusion": "The code pattern is suspicious due to unconventional naming and import style, which could conceal malicious modules. However, no direct malicious activity is evident in this fragment. The syntax error suggests the code is incomplete or intentionally obfuscated. The overall malware risk is low, but further inspection of the imported modules is recommended to confirm their content."

      "security_risk": 0,

      "confidence": 1,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of an MNIST classifier with no malicious or suspicious elements. The security risk and malware scores should be 0, and the obfuscated score should also be 0. The slight elevation in one report's security risk score (0.1) is unnecessary given the benign nature of the code."
