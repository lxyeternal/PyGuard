{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform image classification on a rice dataset using a CNN model, including dataset preparation, model training, and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Reads dataset files from directories, loads images via ImageDataGenerator, and reads class labels from directory structure.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; model training and evaluation are standard procedures.",
  "flows": "Dataset files are loaded from specified directories; images are processed and fed into the model; predictions are generated and visualized.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets observed. The code appears standard for image classification workflows. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by setting dataset paths and creating a validation split from the training data. It uses standard Keras ImageDataGenerator for data loading. The CNN architecture is straightforward, with typical layers for image classification. Model training includes early stopping to prevent overfitting. Evaluation involves generating predictions, a confusion matrix, and classification report. All operations are typical for machine learning workflows, with no evidence of malicious activities such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard image classification implementation with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in a typical manner. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
