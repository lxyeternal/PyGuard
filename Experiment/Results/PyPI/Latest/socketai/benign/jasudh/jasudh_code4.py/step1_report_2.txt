{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform image classification using a CNN on a rice image dataset, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Data reading from directory structure (`os.listdir`, `flow_from_directory`), image data generators, and the model input from local dataset files.",
  "sinks": "Model prediction output, plotting functions, and printing classification report; no untrusted data being sent externally or stored maliciously.",
  "flows": "Input data from directory -> data generators -> model training -> model prediction -> evaluation (confusion matrix, classification report).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden functions.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard image classification pipeline using TensorFlow/Keras with typical data handling and model training steps. No signs of malicious intent or malicious code segments are present. It uses common libraries and standard practices. No external network connections outside of predictable package imports. No code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate implementation of a CNN-based image classifier, with no indications of malicious or sabotage behavior. It is safe and suitable for its intended purpose.",
