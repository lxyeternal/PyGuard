{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform image classification on a rice dataset using a convolutional neural network (CNN). It prepares data, creates a model, trains it, and evaluates its performance.",
  "sources": "Reads dataset images from directory paths, loads images via ImageDataGenerator, and reads class labels from directory structures.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include training logs, confusion matrix visualization, and classification report; no untrusted data is written or transmitted over networks.",
  "flows": "Data is read from directory structures -> processed by ImageDataGenerator -> fed into CNN model -> predictions are generated -> evaluation metrics are computed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard libraries and practices for image classification tasks. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with setting up dataset directories and splits training data into training and validation sets, which is standard practice. It then creates image data generators for normalization. The CNN model is constructed with typical convolutional, pooling, dropout, and dense layers. Training is performed with early stopping. Evaluation includes generating a confusion matrix and classification report. All operations rely on well-known libraries and do not perform any malicious actions or suspicious data manipulations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of CNN-based image classification with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It does not contain obfuscated or suspicious code segments. Overall, it appears safe and intended for legitimate model training and evaluation.",
