  "purpose": "Importing multiple modules with numeric names using wildcard imports, potentially obfuscated or malicious modules.",
  "sources": "Modules named .1, .2, .3, .4, .5 imported via relative import statements.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; potential for imported modules to execute malicious code upon import.",
  "flows": "Import statements trigger execution of module code; no direct data flow visible in snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual module names starting with digits, wildcard imports, syntax invalid in standard Python, suspicious naming pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from modules with numeric names, which are unconventional and can be used to obfuscate malicious modules. The syntax 'from .1 import *' is invalid in Python, indicating either the code is a placeholder or has been obfuscated. The use of wildcard imports ('*') can hide malicious code within modules. No direct malicious activity is observable in this snippet, but the pattern warrants further inspection of the imported modules. The suspicion level is moderate due to naming and import style, but no evidence of malicious behavior is present in the code itself. The invalid syntax reduces immediate risk but highlights potential obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern is suspicious due to unconventional naming and import style, which could conceal malicious modules. However, no direct malicious activity is evident in this fragment. The syntax error suggests the code is incomplete or intentionally obfuscated. The overall malware risk is low, but further inspection of the imported modules is recommended to confirm their content.",
