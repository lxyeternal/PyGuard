{
  "purpose": "The code exports a collection of widget classes for use in a Python GUI application.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'jbqt.widgets' package modules and classes, and a list of exported class names.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external communication, such as network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Imports do not process untrusted data; exports simply define accessible classes for external use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports several widget classes from a 'jbqt.widgets' package and defines an __all__ list for module exports. It appears to be a straightforward module designed for re-exporting widgets. There are no data inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module re-exporting GUI widget classes with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears benign and standard for organizing package exports.",
