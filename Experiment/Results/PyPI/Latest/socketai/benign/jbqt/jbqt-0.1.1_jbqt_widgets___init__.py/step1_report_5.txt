  "purpose": "This code serves as an aggregation module that imports specific widget classes from the 'jbqt.widgets' package and exports them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'jbqt.widgets' submodules: 'chip_button', 'chips', 'multiselect', 'simple', and 'toast'.",
  "sinks": "The code only imports classes and defines __all__; no data is processed or output; no untrusted data handling or network communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports and re-exports classes without any data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors; the code is straightforward and only manages imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific widget classes from the 'jbqt.widgets' package and defines an '__all__' list to specify what is exported. It does not process user input, handle data, or perform any actions beyond module import/export management. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present, and there are no signs of obfuscation or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module for re-exporting widget classes with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks. It is standard Python package code with no indications of malware or security issues.",
