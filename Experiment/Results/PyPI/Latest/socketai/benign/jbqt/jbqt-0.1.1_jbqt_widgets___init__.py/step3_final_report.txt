{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports specific widget classes from submodules within the 'jbqt.widgets' package and re-exports them for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports classes from internal modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code does not process untrusted input or perform network/file operations.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes from internal modules and exposes them via the __all__ list; there are no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple re-export module that imports specific widget classes and defines an __all__ list for exports. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code structure is standard, and there are no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns. No anomalies or security concerns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module for organizing and exporting widget classes. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
