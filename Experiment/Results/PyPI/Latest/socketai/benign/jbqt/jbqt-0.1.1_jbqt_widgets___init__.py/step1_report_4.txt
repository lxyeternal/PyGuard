  "purpose": "This code exports a collection of widget classes from a package for use in a GUI application.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'jbqt.widgets' modules and the __all__ declaration listing exported classes.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources are evident.",
  "flows": "Imported classes are included in __all__, facilitating their use elsewhere; no data flow from untrusted sources detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious constructs, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific widget classes from submodules of 'jbqt.widgets' and defines an __all__ list for exports. It functions as a typical module aggregator. No input sources, data handling, or execution of untrusted code are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python module practices. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module that organizes and exports widget classes for use in GUI applications. There are no security concerns, malicious behaviors, or anomalies detected in this code.",
