  "purpose": "Defines a QWidget subclass for a chip button UI component.",
  "sources": "Imports from abc module, PyQt6.QtCore, and PyQt6.QtWidgets.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only class inheritance and method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines an interface class (IChipButton) extending QWidget, with a constructor that calls the superclass constructor. It imports standard modules for UI components and abstract methods, but does not implement any logic or data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a straightforward UI component definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign class definition for a UI element with no malicious intent or security issues.",
