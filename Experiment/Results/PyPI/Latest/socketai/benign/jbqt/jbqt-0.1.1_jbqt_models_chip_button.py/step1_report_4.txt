  "purpose": "Defines an interface for a chip button widget using PyQt6 framework.",
  "sources": "None - no input data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "None - no data sinks or data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow identified; code is purely structural and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines an abstract base class 'IChipButton' inheriting from QWidget, and has a simple constructor. It is a minimal, standard PyQt6 widget class definition with no signs of malicious behavior, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard interface class definition for a UI component with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical implementation in PyQt6 applications.",
