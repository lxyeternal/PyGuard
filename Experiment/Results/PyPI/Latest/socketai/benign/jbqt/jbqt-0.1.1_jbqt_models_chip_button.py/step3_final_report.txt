  "purpose": "Define a PyQt6 widget class intended as an interface or base class for a chip button component.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; imports are static and unused.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Class instantiation flow; no data flow or execution beyond constructor call.",
  "anomalies": "Unused imports of 'abstractmethod' and 'ABC'; class name suggests interface but implemented as concrete class.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal PyQt6 widget class with an unused import of abstract base class components. It contains no data handling, network activity, or malicious logic. The class appears to serve as a base or interface for further extension. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate a benign purpose. The unused imports suggest incomplete design but do not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward PyQt6 widget class with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and risk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
