  "purpose": "Define a widget class for a chips button in a PyQt6 GUI application",
  "sources": "Import statements from standard and PyQt6 modules, class constructor",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external effects",
  "flows": "Constructor initializes the QWidget, no data flow with untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; imports are standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports abstract base class tools and PyQt6 modules, then defines an interface class IChipButton inheriting from QWidget. The class constructor only calls the superclass constructor with an optional parent. There are no data inputs, network operations, or code execution, nor any suspicious behavior or anomalies present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard PyQt6 widget class definition with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
