      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, with some reports indicating potential risks due to dangerous functions and obfuscation. Report 2's high suspicion is justified. Slightly increasing the malware score in Report 3 from 0.4 to 0.5 would better reflect the observed risky functions. Overall, the dependency exhibits low to moderate security risk, with most patterns not definitively malicious but warranting caution."

The low risk score (~0.2) is justified by reliance on external callbacks, but the code itself is safe. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. Overall, it poses minimal security concerns."
