  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the context, and the reasoning provided.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of class definitions for a PyQt6 widget interface, with all methods unimplemented (stubs).\n- There are no data flows, external inputs, or outputs.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The imports are standard, and the class structure is typical for a UI component interface.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code appears benign, with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any implementation; all methods are placeholders.\n- No data processing, external communication, or malicious code is present.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify the code as an interface/base class with no active logic.\n- The confidence levels are high, and the reasoning is sound.\n- No significant logical flaws are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** All assign 0 or very close to it, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Potential Issues or Concerns:\n- Since the code is purely structural with no implementation, it cannot contain malicious behavior itself.\n- However, in supply chain security, even interface definitions can sometimes be exploited if misused, but this is unlikely here given the context.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 (very low, mainly because incomplete code can sometimes be extended maliciously, but as-is, no risk)\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a standard interface/base class for a GUI component.\n- No data flows, no external data, no active logic.\n- No signs of malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed unless future implementations introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis supply chain snippet is a benign, structural interface with no malicious or security concerns in its current form.",
