  "purpose": "Defines an interface/base class for a PyQt6 widget managing chips, with method signatures but no implementation.",
  "sources": "Class constructor, method signatures, import statements",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, external communication, or data processing",
  "flows": "No active data flows; methods are placeholders",
  "anomalies": "Methods are unimplemented; no logic or data handling; no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a structural interface for a GUI component with no active logic, data flow, or external interactions. It imports standard PyQt6 modules and defines an abstract class with placeholder methods. No malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by all reports, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0, considering the code's structural, non-executable nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, structural interface with no malicious or security-risk behavior. The scores should reflect this, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
