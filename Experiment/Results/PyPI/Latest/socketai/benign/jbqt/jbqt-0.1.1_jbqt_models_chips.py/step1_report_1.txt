  "purpose": "Defines an interface and base class for a chips widget in a PyQt6 application",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; methods are placeholders without implementations",
  "anomalies": "All methods are stubs with no implementation, no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns, no dynamic execution or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract interface and a QWidget subclass for managing chips UI components. All methods are placeholders, indicating an incomplete implementation. There are no external data sources, no untrusted input handling, and no suspicious code behavior. The imports and class structures are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be a normal UI component interface with no evidence of malicious or security-risk behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of a widget interface with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be an incomplete or abstract base class for a PyQt6 widget, with no active data processing or external interactions.",
