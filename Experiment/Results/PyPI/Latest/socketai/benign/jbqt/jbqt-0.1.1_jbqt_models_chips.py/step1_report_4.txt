{
  "purpose": "Define an interface for a Chips Widget in a PyQt6 application.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (PyQt6 and jbqt.models.chip_button). No input or data reading sources are evident in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data handling operations are present in the code.",
  "flows": "The code sets up method signatures for adding/removing chips, but contains no executable logic or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The methods are placeholders without implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code only establishes a class interface with method signatures and imports necessary libraries for a GUI widget. There are no data processing, external input handling, or security-sensitive operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity is present. The code appears to be a standard, incomplete class definition for a UI component.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, non-malicious class interface definition for a PyQt6 widget, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
