  "purpose": "Define an interface and base class for a chips widget UI component in PyQt6.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; class initialization and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; methods are placeholders with no implementation.",
  "anomalies": "All methods are unimplemented; no suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an interface (IChipsWidget) for a widget related to chips, with no implementation details. It imports standard modules and a custom interface IChipButton. The class and methods contain no logic, only signatures and docstrings, which indicates a structural or architectural setup rather than executable logic. There are no external data reads, no code execution, no network activity, or other suspicious activities. The lack of implementation makes it impossible for malicious code to be present within these stubs. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward interface definition with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign interface definition with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It contains no executable logic or suspicious constructs. The absence of implementation prevents any malicious activity from occurring within this snippet.",
