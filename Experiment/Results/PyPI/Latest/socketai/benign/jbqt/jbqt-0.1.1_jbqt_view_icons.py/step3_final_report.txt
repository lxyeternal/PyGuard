  "purpose": "A GUI utility for browsing, searching, and copying icon names from system themes, Qt icons, or specified directories.",
  "sources": "Filesystem traversal for icon files, user input from search bar, icon selection via GUI, clipboard for copying icon names.",
  "sinks": "Clipboard for copying icon names, GUI display for icon visualization, filesystem for icon retrieval.",
  "flows": "User inputs search text -> fuzzy matching filters icons -> icons displayed in table -> user clicks icon -> icon name copied to clipboard.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries and APIs for GUI, filesystem access, and string matching. It performs filesystem traversal to gather icons, displays them in a grid, and allows copying icon names. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or obfuscated code is present. Clipboard operations are straightforward. The fuzzywuzzy library is used for search filtering but does not introduce security risks. Overall, the code is a benign icon browsing utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign GUI application for icon browsing and copying. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect this benign nature with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk score around 0.1.",
