{
  "purpose": "A GUI tool for displaying and searching icons from various sources (system themes, Qt icons, standard icons) with clipboard copying functionality.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments, environment variables for theme selection, and filesystem to load icons from /usr/share/icons.",
  "sinks": "Clipboard API (QApplication.clipboard().setText), GUI display elements, and print statements.",
  "flows": "User input in search bar triggers fuzzy matching and updates icon display; clicking an icon copies its name to clipboard.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic code execution observed. Use of print for debugging, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries for GUI (PyQt6) and fuzzy matching. It loads icon names from filesystem or theme based on command-line args. The user input triggers fuzzy search, and clicking icons copies names to clipboard, with a visual toast notification. No network activity, no data exfiltration, no dynamic code execution, nor obfuscated segments. The logic is straightforward, primarily UI management and data handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate icon browsing tool without any malicious intent or malicious code components. It relies on standard libraries and filesystem access, and all operations seem intended for user interface purposes. No malicious or sabotage behaviors are evident.",
