{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be exporting specific classes from the jbqt.models module, likely for use in other parts of an application.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes IChipsWidget and IChipButton from the jbqt.models package.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data handling or output mechanisms that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes and exposes them via __all__, with no data flow from untrusted sources or to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and standard for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports two classes from a package and explicitly declares them for external use. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration. The structure is typical for Python modules exporting specific classes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export pattern with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply re-exports classes from a package for external use.",
