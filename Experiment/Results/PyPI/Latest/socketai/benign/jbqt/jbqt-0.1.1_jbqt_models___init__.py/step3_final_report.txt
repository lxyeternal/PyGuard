{
  "purpose": "Module export of specific classes from jbqt.models for external use",
  "sources": "Import statements from jbqt.models.chips and jbqt.models.chip_button",
  "sinks": "None; static import and export, no data flow or external data handling",
  "flows": "Import of classes -> __all__ declaration",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes and exposes them via __all__, serving as a re-export module. No dynamic execution, data handling, or external interactions are present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks are detected. The code is minimal and standard for module exports, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk aligning with its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module export pattern with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
