  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling PyQt6 widgets and application registration within a larger PyQt6-based application.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from GUI widgets such as QLineEdit, QTextEdit, QSpinBox, QDoubleSpinBox, QCheckBox, QCalendarWidget, and QListWidgetItem.",
  "sinks": "Data retrieval from widgets (get_widget_value), setting widget values (set_widget_value), and app registration (register_app). No external data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Widget data is read via get_widget_value and can be set via set_widget_value. App registration modifies global state via consts.set_icon_dir and consts.GlobalRefs.app.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code mostly handles standard widget operations. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious logic. The print statements for exceptions are typical for debugging and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for GUI widget data handling and application setup. It reads widget data in a controlled manner, converting types as needed, with exception handling for value conversion. There are no network operations, file modifications, or external data transmissions. The only potentially concerning aspect is the use of print statements for exception reporting, which is not secure, but this is typical for debugging and not malicious. Overall, the code is straightforward and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for a PyQt6 application with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. It handles widget data operations securely and transparently. The low malware score and security risk score reflect this assessment.",
