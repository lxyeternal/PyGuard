  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing and retrieving widget values in a PyQt6 application, including setting values and registering the application.",
  "sources": "Data is read from GUI widgets such as QLineEdit, QTextEdit, QSpinBox, QDoubleSpinBox, QCheckBox, QCalendarWidget, and QListWidgetItem.",
  "sinks": "Return statements providing widget data; no external data sinks like network, file, or database operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data from user interaction flows through get_widget_value() to return widget content; set_widget_value() updates widget states based on provided values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code logic identified. Use of print statements for error handling is standard for debugging, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions for widget value retrieval and setting in a PyQt6 application. It includes type checks and exception handling, with no external data transmission or suspicious logic. No hidden or malicious behaviors are evident. The import of external libraries and project-specific modules appears standard for GUI applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate GUI utility functions with no malicious intent. It handles widget data safely without risky operations or external communications. No malicious or malicious-suspicious patterns are present.",
