  "flows": "Data flows from widget input methods to internal variables and vice versa",
  "anomalies": "None detected; standard exception handling and debugging print statements",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing typical GUI widget data retrieval and assignment. No network, file, or external system interactions are present. Exception handling is standard for type conversions. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. The functions operate within the scope of GUI data management, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard GUI utility functions with no malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
