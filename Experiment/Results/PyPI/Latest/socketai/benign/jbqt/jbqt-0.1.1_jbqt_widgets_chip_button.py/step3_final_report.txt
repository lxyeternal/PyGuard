  "purpose": "GUI widget for managing tags with optional weights, allowing editing, removal, and weight adjustment through user interactions.",
  "sources": "User input via QLineEdit (edit_line), external callbacks (on_update, on_remove), and dialog inputs for weight.",
  "sinks": "Callback functions (on_update, on_remove) that could potentially be exploited if malicious callbacks are provided.",
  "flows": "User modifies tag or weight -> triggers emit_update or update_weight -> calls external callbacks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, network calls, or obfuscation detected. Use of exec() for dialogs is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward PyQt6 GUI component managing tags with editing and removal features. It employs standard practices such as event filtering, toggle visibility, and dialog-based input. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. External callbacks are a typical pattern but could be exploited if malicious, which is outside static analysis scope. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured GUI component with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk score (~0.2) is justified by reliance on external callbacks, but the code itself is safe. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. Overall, it poses minimal security concerns.",
