  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured GUI component with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk score (~0.2) is justified by reliance on external callbacks, but the code itself is safe. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. Overall, it poses minimal security concerns."
