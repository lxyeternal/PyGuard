  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, with some reports indicating potential risks due to dangerous functions and obfuscation. Report 2's high suspicion is justified. Slightly increasing the malware score in Report 3 from 0.4 to 0.5 would better reflect the observed risky functions. Overall, the dependency exhibits low to moderate security risk, with most patterns not definitively malicious but warranting caution."
