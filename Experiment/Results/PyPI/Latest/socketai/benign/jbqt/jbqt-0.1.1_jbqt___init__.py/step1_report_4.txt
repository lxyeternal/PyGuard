  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for general functionality, potentially involving data processing or network communication, but without specific context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, or standard input (if present). No explicit data sources identified from the code snippet provided.",
  "sinks": "Uses print statements, file operations, or network connections as output sinks. No explicit dangerous sinks identified from the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks. No suspicious flow patterns detected in the given code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code constructs, or suspicious logic observed. Code structure appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical data processing tasks with standard Python functions and constructs. No obfuscated code, malicious API calls, or malicious behaviors such as network exfiltration, system damage, or backdoors are evident. Usage of third-party libraries is within normal expectations. No indications of malicious code injection or malicious logic in the given snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard and benign, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies identified.",
