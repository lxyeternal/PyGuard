{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, its primary purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, environment variables, and potentially user input via input() calls.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to logs, printed to console, or sent over network connections via socket or requests modules.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input from environment variables or user input flows into processing functions, and potentially gets transmitted over the network or written to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspiciously obfuscated code detected. The code structure appears straightforward. No unusual use of dynamic execution or misleading variable names observed.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing standard libraries and reading data from environment variables and user inputs. Functions are defined for processing data, with some outputs printed or sent to external services. No malicious network connections, hidden code, or suspicious logic are present. The usage of environment variables and user input as data sources is typical, and no unsafe code practices such as insecure eval, exec, or insecure database queries are detected. The code structure is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malware indicators. Overall, it seems to perform standard data handling without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing typical data processing tasks without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or malware indicators are present based on this analysis.",
