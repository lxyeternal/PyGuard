  "purpose": "Re-export module that imports constants and functions from internal modules and exposes them via __all__ for organized access.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'jbqt.common.consts' and 'jbqt.common.qt_utils'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not process external input or output data",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from sources to sinks; code only re-exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports specific constants and functions and re-exports them via __all__. It contains no dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling. Multiple reviews confirm its benign nature, with consistent scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The structure is straightforward, and no suspicious behavior is present. The imported modules are internal and assumed safe; the code's purpose is purely organizational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward re-export module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All assessments and scores are justified and consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency.",
