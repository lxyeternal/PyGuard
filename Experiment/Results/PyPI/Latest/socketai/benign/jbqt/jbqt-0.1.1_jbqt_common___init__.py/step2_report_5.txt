  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports consistently describe this code as a straightforward re-export module.\n- No signs of data processing, dynamic code execution, or network activity.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are noted.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code indeed only imports constants and functions from internal modules and re-exports them via `__all__`.\n- There are no signs of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n- The structure is standard for organizing module exports.\n\n**Potential issues or errors:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no issues are present in the code itself.\n- The logic and reasoning in the reports are sound; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is justified.\n- The obfuscated scores are all 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, correctly reflecting the lack of security concerns.\n\n**Justification for any higher scores:**\n- Since the code is purely re-exporting internal constants and functions, there is no reason to assign higher risk or malware scores.\n- If the imported modules (`jbqt.common.consts`, `jbqt.common.qt_utils`) contain vulnerabilities, they are outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The scores assigned in all reports seem reasonable and justified.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a standard, benign module for re-exporting constants and functions. The reports are accurate, and the scores align with the code's behavior. No further action or concern is necessary.",
