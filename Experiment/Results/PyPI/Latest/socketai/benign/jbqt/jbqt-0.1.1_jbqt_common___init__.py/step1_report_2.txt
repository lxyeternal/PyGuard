  "purpose": "Export constants and a utility function for use in other modules",
  "sources": "Imports from 'jbqt.common.consts' and 'jbqt.common.qt_utils'",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow to untrusted sources",
  "flows": "None, as the code only imports and re-exports identifiers",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import and export statements",
  "analysis": "The code simply re-exports constants and a function from external modules without any processing or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, hidden payloads, or suspicious data handling. It appears to be a standard module meant for organizing exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a re-export module for constants and utilities. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
