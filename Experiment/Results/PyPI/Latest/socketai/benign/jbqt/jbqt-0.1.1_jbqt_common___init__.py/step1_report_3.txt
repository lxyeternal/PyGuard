  "purpose": "To export constants and a utility function for use in other modules",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules: 'jbqt.common.consts' and 'jbqt.common.qt_utils'",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or handling untrusted input within this code",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only performs imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports constants and functions from other modules and re-exports them via __all__ for controlled namespace exposure. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or execute untrusted code. The imports are from presumably internal libraries, and no potential malicious behavior is evident. The structure is straightforward, serving as a module export interface.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a re-export of constants and a utility function with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and standard.",
