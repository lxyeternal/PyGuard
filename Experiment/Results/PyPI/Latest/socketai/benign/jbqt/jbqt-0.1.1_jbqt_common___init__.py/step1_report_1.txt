{
  "purpose": "Exports constants and utility functions for use in other modules",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules: jbqt.common.consts and jbqt.common.qt_utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code only exports imported items",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data; just re-exporting imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific constants and functions from internal modules and re-exports them via __all__. There is no dynamic code execution, no data input handling, and no suspicious code behaviors. The imported modules may contain vulnerabilities, but this code snippet itself does not perform any data processing or network operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward re-export module with no malicious behavior. It simply exposes certain constants and functions for use elsewhere. There are no signs of malware or security risks in this snippet.",
