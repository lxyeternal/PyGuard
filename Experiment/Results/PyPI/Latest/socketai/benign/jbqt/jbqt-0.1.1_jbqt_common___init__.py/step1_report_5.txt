{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to export constants and a utility function for use in other modules or packages.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external modules 'jbqt.common.consts' and 'jbqt.common.qt_utils'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing; the code does not handle untrusted input or perform any data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simply re-exports symbols imported from other modules.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward and standard for a module defining exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific constants and a function from a common package, then defines __all__ for explicit exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden code, or unusual patterns. The code's structure suggests it is a simple module for re-exporting references for convenience.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module focused on exporting constants and a utility function. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
