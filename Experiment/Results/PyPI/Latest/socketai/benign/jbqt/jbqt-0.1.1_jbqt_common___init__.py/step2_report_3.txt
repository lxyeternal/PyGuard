  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review**:\n   - The code is a straightforward module that imports specific constants and functions from internal modules (`jbqt.common.consts` and `jbqt.common.qt_utils`) and re-exports them via `__all__`.\n   - There are no dynamic code executions, no data processing, no network operations, and no untrusted input handling.\n   - The code structure is simple, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Findings**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is a benign re-export module with no malicious behavior.\n   - The analysis in each report correctly identifies that there are no anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious code patterns.\n   - The confidence level across all reports is 1, indicating high certainty that the code is safe.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**:\n     - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n     - There are no signs of malicious payloads, hidden code, or suspicious behaviors.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**:\n     - All reports assign 0, which is correct since the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Security Risk Score**:\n     - All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or security concerns in this snippet.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Discrepancies**:\n   - No issues are identified; the reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The code does not import or execute any code that could be malicious, nor does it handle untrusted data.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation**:\n   - The code is a standard, safe module for exporting constants and functions.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - There is no need to adjust scores or raise concerns based on the provided information.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThe code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately. No further action is necessary.",
