  "purpose": "This code loads environment variables related to API keys, models, and configurations for a PDF processing and AI interaction system.",
  "sources": "os.getenv() calls retrieving environment variables such as OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENAI_MODEL, DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE, EMBEDDING_MODEL, TOP_K_RETRIEVAL",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write untrusted data to files, network, or other external systems",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read from the environment and assigned to variables; no further data flows or processing occurs",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets other than environment variable references; no suspicious code or unusual constructs observed; use of dotenv for environment management is standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and dotenv modules, loads environment variables, and assigns values to configuration variables with default fallbacks. It does not perform any network communication, data processing, or file manipulation beyond environment variable access. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious data handling, or suspicious logic. This appears to be a standard configuration setup for a Python application relying on environment variables.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration loader for environment variables. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply reads configuration data from the environment to be used elsewhere in the application.",
