{
  "purpose": "The code loads environment variables to configure API keys, model parameters, and settings for processing PDFs and embeddings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.getenv(), loaded through load_dotenv()",
  "sinks": "API key stored in OPENAI_API_KEY, environment variables used for model and size configurations",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and assigned to variables for later use in API calls and processing",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads configuration parameters from environment variables, with default values assigned if not present. It uses dotenv to facilitate environment management. No user input or external data is directly processed. The API key and model configurations are stored in memory but not transmitted or leaked within this snippet. The code is straightforward and does not perform any network requests, file modifications, or code execution beyond environment variable access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration loader for an application that interacts with OpenAI APIs and embedding models. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is purely for setup and configuration purposes.",
