  "purpose": "Load configuration parameters and sensitive data such as API keys and model settings from environment variables for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.getenv() and dotenv.load_dotenv()",
  "sinks": "Variables storing API keys and configuration data; no direct data leaks or external transmissions occur within this snippet",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at the start and stored in variables for later use; no external data flow or network activity is present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious logic, or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code imports dotenv and os, loads environment variables, and assigns them to variables with defaults. It handles sensitive data like API keys in environment variables, which is standard practice. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is present. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external handling of secrets outside this code snippet. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting standard configuration management with minimal inherent risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard environment configuration loader with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
