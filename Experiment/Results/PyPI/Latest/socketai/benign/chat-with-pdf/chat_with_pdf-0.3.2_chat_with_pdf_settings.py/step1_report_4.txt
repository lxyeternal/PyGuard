{
  "purpose": "Load environment variables and set default configuration values for API keys, models, and parameters used in a machine learning or AI application.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.getenv() for API keys, model names, chunk size, embedding model, and retrieval count.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables; no data is directly written or transmitted to external sources within this code.",
  "flows": "Reads from environment variables at startup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials other than the default empty string for API key; use of dotenv is standard but does not by itself introduce malicious behavior; no suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables using dotenv, with fallbacks for default values. It assigns configuration parameters like API key, model names, chunk sizes, and retrieval counts. There are no dynamic code evaluations, external network communications, or hidden behaviors. The use of environment variables is typical for configuration management, not malicious activity. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration loader for an AI application, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply reads configuration data from environment variables, providing defaults where necessary.",
