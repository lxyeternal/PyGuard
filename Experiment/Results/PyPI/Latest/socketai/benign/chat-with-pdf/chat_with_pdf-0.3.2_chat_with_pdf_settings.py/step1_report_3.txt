  "purpose": "The code loads environment variables to configure API keys, models, and parameters for a PDF processing and AI interaction system.",
  "sources": "os.getenv() calls retrieving environment variables for API keys, model names, chunk sizes, and retrieval parameters.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables used directly as configuration parameters; no direct sinks of untrusted data or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and assigned to internal variables, which are then used for configuration purposes; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; environment variables are used appropriately for configuration. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. No obfuscation or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports os and dotenv, loads environment variables, and assigns them to internal configuration variables. It handles API keys, model names, chunk sizes, embedding models, and retrieval parameters. All data is sourced from environment variables, which is standard practice for configuration. There are no code injections, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The use of dotenv for environment management is normal. No unusual code structures or malicious intents are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard environment variable loading and configuration setup without any malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. It is a typical configuration module for an AI or PDF processing application.",
