{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse PDF files and extract text in chunks.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'pdf_data' which can be a file path, bytes, or BytesIO stream.",
  "sinks": "The code reads from 'pdf_data' and opens it with fitz.open(), then extracts text via page.get_text().",
  "flows": "Input (pdf_data) -> fitz.open() -> iteration over pages -> page.get_text() -> text splitting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code detected. No network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly opens PDF files from various input types and extracts text. The use of fitz (PyMuPDF) is standard for PDF parsing. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is present. The code only reads and processes the input PDF data without performing any external communications or sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical PDF parsing utility with no indications of malicious behavior. It processes input data safely within its scope. No malicious intent or security risks identified.",
