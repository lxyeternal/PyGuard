{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse PDF files and extract text content in chunks.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from a string (file path or URL), bytes, or BytesIO object to load a PDF document.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data beyond reading and returning text chunks.",
  "flows": "Input data → fitz.open() → extract text via page.get_text() → return chunks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Uses standard libraries and functions without obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a PDF parser class with configurable chunk size. It accepts various input types (str, bytes, BytesIO) and opens the PDF using fitz (PyMuPDF). It extracts text from each page and splits the full text into chunks for further processing. The logic appears straightforward and uses standard, well-known libraries for PDF processing. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or obfuscated code present. No hardcoded secrets or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard PDF parsing utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to extract text from PDF files and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
