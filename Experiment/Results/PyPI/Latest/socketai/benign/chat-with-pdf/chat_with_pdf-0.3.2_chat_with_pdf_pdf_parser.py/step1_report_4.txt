{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse PDF files and extract text in chunks.",
  "sources": "pdf_data input parameter, which can be a file path, bytes, or BytesIO stream.",
  "sinks": "fitz.open() function that opens the PDF stream, and page.get_text() that extracts text from pages.",
  "flows": "pdf_data (source) -> fitz.open() -> page.get_text() (sink), with data passing through the stream and page processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code relies on a standard library (PyMuPDF) for PDF parsing. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a PDF parser class with configurable chunk size. It supports input as a file path, bytes, or BytesIO object, and opens PDFs securely via fitz.open(). It then extracts text from each page and splits it into chunks. The use of fitz.open() with streams and bytes is appropriate and standard. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be a legitimate PDF parsing utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward PDF text extraction utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard library functions properly and does not contain any malicious or suspicious code.",
