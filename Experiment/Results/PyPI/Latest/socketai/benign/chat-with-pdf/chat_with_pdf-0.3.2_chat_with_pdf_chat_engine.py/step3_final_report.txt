{
  "purpose": "Provides a PDF question-answering interface by loading PDFs from bytes, URLs, or local files, parsing content, embedding, retrieving relevant chunks, and querying an external LLM API.",
  "sources": "PDF data from bytes, URLs via HTTP requests, or local file system; environment variables for API keys and models.",
  "sinks": "External API calls to OpenAI's servers for question answering; PDF download via requests.",
  "flows": "PDF source input -> parsing -> embedding -> retrieval -> context assembly -> ask_llm API call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard external requests and environment variable usage; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles different PDF sources, validates inputs, and uses environment variables for sensitive data. External requests are limited to downloading PDFs and querying the LLM API, both typical operations. No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious behavior. The security risk score is low (0.2), reflecting external network interactions but no malicious intent. The code's structure and logic are straightforward and well-implemented, indicating high confidence in its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for PDF-based question-answering with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minimal security risk is due to external data fetching and API communication, which are typical in such systems. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security assessment is positive.",
