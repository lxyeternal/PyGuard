{
  "purpose": "To load, parse, embed, and retrieve information from PDF documents for chatbot interactions.",
  "sources": "User input: pdf_source parameter (bytes, URL string, file path); environment variables; external dependencies (requests, chat_with_pdf modules).",
  "sinks": "External network requests via requests.get; call to ask_llm function which interacts with an external API (OpenAI).",
  "flows": "pdf_source → _resolve_pdf_source (bytes, URL, file path) → parse and embed → retrieve relevant chunks → send query and context to ask_llm API.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets in code. Use of environment variables for API keys is standard. No unusual code structures, obfuscation, or dynamic execution observed. External requests are made but seem appropriate for functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages API keys via environment variables or settings, downloads PDFs over HTTPS, and processes them. The ask method interacts with an external LLM API, which is typical for chatbot functionality. No malicious or suspicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system disruption found. No suspicious or malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no signs of obfuscation. External requests are limited to PDF retrieval and legitimate API calls.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement standard PDF processing and chatbot querying features without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It relies on environment variables for sensitive data, making hardcoded secrets unlikely. No malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads detected.",
