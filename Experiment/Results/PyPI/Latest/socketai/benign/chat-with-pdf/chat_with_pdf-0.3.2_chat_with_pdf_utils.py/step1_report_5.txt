  "purpose": "Function to send a prompt to OpenAI's ChatCompletion API and return the response.",
  "sources": "API key provided as a parameter, 'openai.api_key' is set from the input parameter.",
  "sinks": "Response data is retrieved from openai.ChatCompletion.create and returned.",
  "flows": "The API key is used to authenticate requests; responses flow from the API back to the caller.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; the API key is passed as a parameter, reducing risk. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that constructs a prompt with provided context and query, sets the API key dynamically, and calls the OpenAI API. It uses standard API interaction patterns without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident. The API key is supplied as an argument, avoiding hardcoded secrets. The function handles the response safely, returning only the message content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper function with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. It responsibly manages the API key and uses standard API calls. There are no security concerns or malware indicators.",
