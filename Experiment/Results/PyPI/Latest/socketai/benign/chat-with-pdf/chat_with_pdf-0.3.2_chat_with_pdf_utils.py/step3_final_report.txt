  "purpose": "A simple wrapper function to send prompts to OpenAI's ChatCompletion API, utilizing an API key provided as a parameter.",
  "sources": "The API key parameter, the prompt construction, and the API call to openai.ChatCompletion.create()",
  "sinks": "The response content returned from the API call; no untrusted data sinks are present in the code",
  "flows": "API key parameter -> openai.api_key assignment -> API request -> response handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward implementation",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API wrapper that assigns the API key securely via parameter, constructs a prompt, and calls the API. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The response is returned directly without additional processing. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and low security risk (~0.1). The handling of the API key as a parameter is standard practice and does not introduce inherent risk. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward API wrapper with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and justified. No further action or concern is necessary.",
