{
  "purpose": "Provides a function to send queries to OpenAI's ChatCompletion API with specified context and API key.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters 'query', 'context', and 'api_key'. Uses 'openai.api_key' for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'openai.ChatCompletion.create' with constructed prompt and parameters, and returns the generated response content.",
  "flows": "Uses 'api_key' to authenticate API request; 'query' and 'context' form the prompt; response is retrieved from API output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The API key is assigned directly from function parameter, which is typical but should be handled securely.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward wrapper around OpenAI's API, setting the API key from a function parameter. The prompt construction and API call are standard. No suspicious logic, malicious data manipulation, or backdoors are evident. No malicious network activity or data exfiltration occurs within this code. The use of user-provided API key and parameters is typical for API wrappers. The function itself does not perform any harmful actions beyond making an API call and returning the result.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API wrapper with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It does not contain malware or supply chain sabotage elements. The primary concern is that the API key is passed directly as a parameter, which should be managed securely, but this is not inherently malicious.",
