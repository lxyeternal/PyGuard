{
  "purpose": "Defines a function to send queries to OpenAI's ChatCompletion API with provided context and API key.",
  "sources": "The function reads the API key from the input parameter 'api_key' and uses it to set the openai.api_key; it also reads 'query', 'context', and 'model' parameters.",
  "sinks": "The API key is assigned directly to openai.api_key, which is used in the openai library to authenticate requests. The function sends a request to the OpenAI API endpoint.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'api_key', 'query', 'context', and 'model' flow into the API key assignment and the API request; the API call transmits the prompt data to OpenAI servers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets; the API key is passed as a parameter, reducing risk. The function constructs a prompt with user-provided data without sanitization, but no malicious injection is evident. No suspicious network activity beyond legitimate API use.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the openai library and defines a function to send prompts to OpenAI's API. It assigns the provided API key to the library's configuration, constructs a prompt combining context and question, and makes an API call with specified parameters. The response is extracted and returned. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network behavior. The API key is handled as an input parameter, which is best practice for security. The overall structure appears standard and legitimate for a language model query interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility function for querying OpenAI's API, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly manages the API key as an input parameter, avoiding hardcoded secrets. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious activity are detected.",
