{
  "purpose": "Provides a function to send prompts to OpenAI's ChatCompletion API and retrieve responses.",
  "sources": "The API key provided as an argument; the user-defined query and context strings.",
  "sinks": "The openai.ChatCompletion.create() function, which sends data over the network; the API key could be misused if leaked.",
  "flows": "The API key is set to openai.api_key, then used in a network request via openai.ChatCompletion.create(). User input (query, context) is embedded into the prompt and sent over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no unusual or dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded credentials are present. The API key is passed as an argument, reducing risk of hardcoding. The function does not store or log data internally. No suspicious URL or data exfiltration mechanisms are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it defines a function to send a prompt to OpenAI's API using provided parameters. It assigns the API key dynamically, avoiding hardcoded secrets. The request parameters seem standard, with no suspicious modifications. The function does not perform any file operations, data storage, or external network connections beyond the intended API call. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The data flow is limited to a typical API request with user-supplied data, with no malicious payloads or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate API wrapper function with no indications of malicious intent or malicious code. It appears safe and standard for interacting with OpenAI's API.",
