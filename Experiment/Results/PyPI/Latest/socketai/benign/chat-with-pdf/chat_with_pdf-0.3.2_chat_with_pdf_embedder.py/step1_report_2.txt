{
  "purpose": "Create embeddings for texts using a sentence transformer model.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing SentenceTransformer; class constructor loading a pre-trained model; embed method encoding input texts.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing embeddings; no untrusted data output or external communication identified.",
  "flows": "Input texts to embed() method -> encoding via self.model.encode() -> return embeddings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard library functions and models without obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known NLP library, defines a class for embedding texts, initializes a model with a default model name, and encodes input texts without additional processing or data leakage mechanisms. No external network calls are made within this snippet, and the model loading is standard. There are no signs of malicious code such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of text embedding using a pre-trained sentence transformer model. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, and its purpose is benign.",
