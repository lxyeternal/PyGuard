  "purpose": "Provides text embeddings using a pre-trained SentenceTransformer model.",
  "sources": "Input list of texts to be embedded.",
  "sinks": "Returns embeddings; no external data or network calls involved.",
  "flows": "Input texts -> embed method -> model.encode() -> embeddings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a reputable NLP library, initializes a model, and encodes texts straightforwardly. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present. The code is simple, well-structured, and uses standard practices. No suspicious or malicious signals identified. Scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with the benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation for text embedding with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly assess its safety, and the scores are justified. No modifications needed.",
