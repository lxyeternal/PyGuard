  "purpose": "Define a class to generate text embeddings using the SentenceTransformer library.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'texts' in the embed method.",
  "sinks": "The encode method of the SentenceTransformer model; outputs embeddings.",
  "flows": "Input texts are passed to the model.encode method, which returns embeddings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known NLP library and defines a class with methods to initialize and generate embeddings. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. The embed method simply calls the model's encode function with safe parameters. No data exfiltration, network communication, or other malicious activities are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, leveraging a reputable open-source library for embedding generation. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks in this code segment.",
