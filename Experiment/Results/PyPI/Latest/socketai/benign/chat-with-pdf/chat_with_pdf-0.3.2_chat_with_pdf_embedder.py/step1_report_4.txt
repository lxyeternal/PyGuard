{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality to generate text embeddings using the SentenceTransformer library.",
  "sources": "Imports from sentence_transformers, constructor parameters, and the embed method input 'texts'.",
  "sinks": "The encode method of SentenceTransformer may process 'texts' data, but no external data or untrusted input is directly evident in the code.",
  "flows": "Input 'texts' flows into the encode function of the SentenceTransformer model, which returns embeddings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures detected. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a sentence embedding model and provides a method to encode a list of texts into embeddings. It uses a standard library with no external data fetching, network calls, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be straightforward and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign implementation for text embedding using a well-known library. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
