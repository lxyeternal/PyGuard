{
  "purpose": "Provides a class to generate embeddings for texts using the SentenceTransformer model.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'texts' parameter in the embed method.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or data leaks; no network or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "Input texts flow into the 'encode' method of SentenceTransformer to produce embeddings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that initializes a pre-trained sentence transformer model and provides a method to encode a list of texts into embeddings. No external data sources or untrusted input handling beyond standard input parameter; no network, file, or environment variable access. Uses a well-known library (sentence_transformers). No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The implementation appears straightforward and intended for embedding generation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign implementation for text embedding using a publicly available library. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
