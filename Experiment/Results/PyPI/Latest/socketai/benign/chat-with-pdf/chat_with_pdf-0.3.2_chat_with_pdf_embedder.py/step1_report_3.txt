{
  "purpose": "Provides text embedding functionality using the SentenceTransformer library.",
  "sources": "The 'sentence_transformers' import and the model_name parameter in __init__.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the embed method outputs embeddings, but no data leakage or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Input texts are processed by self.model.encode() to produce embeddings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known library for sentence embeddings, initializes a model, and provides an embed method. The method converts input texts into embeddings without showing progress or converting to tensor, which is standard. No external network connections, no suspicious code, no dynamic code execution, or data leaks are present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of embedding functionality, with no malicious or sabotage behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for generating text embeddings using SentenceTransformer. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
