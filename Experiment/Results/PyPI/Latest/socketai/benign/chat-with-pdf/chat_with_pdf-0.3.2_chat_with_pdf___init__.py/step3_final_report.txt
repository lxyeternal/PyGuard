  "purpose": "Import the PDFChat class from the local chat_engine module.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only imports a class, with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with no executable logic. All reports agree that this is benign, with high confidence scores and no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Since the snippet does not include the implementation of PDFChat, the assessment is limited to the import statement, which is standard and safe. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors can be inferred from this isolated import.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. Further security evaluation should focus on the implementation of PDFChat itself, but based solely on this import, the code is safe.",
