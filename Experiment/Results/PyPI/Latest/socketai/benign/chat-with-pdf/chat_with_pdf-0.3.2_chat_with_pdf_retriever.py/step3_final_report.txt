  "purpose": "Semantic retrieval of text chunks based on query embeddings using cosine similarity.",
  "sources": "Embedding generation via chat_with_pdf.embedder.Embedder, input query, stored embeddings.",
  "sinks": "Return of top-k chunks; no external data leaks or malicious data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Query input -> embedder.embed() -> cosine_similarity -> argsort -> return chunks.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import of Embedder inside retrieve() method; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard semantic retrieval process with stored embeddings and chunks. It imports Embedder dynamically, which is unconventional but not malicious. No suspicious patterns, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. The absence of external network activity or data exfiltration, combined with clear code structure, supports a low-risk assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard semantic retrieval component with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The dynamic import does not constitute malicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
