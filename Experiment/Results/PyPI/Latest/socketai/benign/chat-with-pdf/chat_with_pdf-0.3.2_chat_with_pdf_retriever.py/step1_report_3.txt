{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Retriever class for retrieving relevant text chunks based on cosine similarity between embeddings, likely used in a semantic search or question-answering system.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the embedder.embed() method call, which processes the query string.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that lead to data leakage or system compromise; no data is sent over network or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Query string input flows into embedder.embed() to generate an embedding; embeddings are compared via cosine_similarity; top matching indices are used to retrieve text chunks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The use of dynamic import within retrieve() is notable but not malicious. No obfuscation or hidden code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a cosine similarity function and numpy for numerical operations. It defines a Retriever class that stores embeddings and text chunks. The retrieve() method dynamically imports an Embedder class, creates an embedder instance, and embeds the query. It then computes cosine similarity scores between the query embedding and stored embeddings, retrieving the top-k most similar chunks. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The dynamic import is standard for modular code. The class functions as intended for a semantic retrieval task.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs semantic retrieval based on embedding similarity without any malicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate component of a larger NLP system, with no security concerns identified.",
