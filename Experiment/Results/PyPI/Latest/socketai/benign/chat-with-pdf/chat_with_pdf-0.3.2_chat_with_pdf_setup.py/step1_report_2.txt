  "purpose": "This setup script defines the configuration for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'chat-with-pdf'.",
  "sources": "Reading the package requirements from the 'install_requires' list and metadata fields such as 'name', 'version', 'author', and 'description'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the script does not execute or pass untrusted data to potentially dangerous functions.",
  "flows": "The code mainly loads static configuration data; no data flow from external sources to dangerous sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected. The dependencies listed are common for machine learning and PDF processing projects.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies metadata, dependencies, and package discovery instructions. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. Dependencies include popular libraries like PyMuPDF, sentence-transformers, scikit-learn, numpy, and openai, which are typical for projects involving PDF processing and AI models. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or unusual behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It is safe and aligned with standard practices.",
