  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'chat-with-pdf' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "User-defined strings for package name, version, description, author, license, and the 'install_requires' list specifying dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no handling of untrusted input or data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions or data sinks; setup process primarily reads static configuration and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is standard setup.py syntax with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It imports setup and find_packages, then calls setup() with static data including package info and required libraries. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution present. Dependencies are standard scientific and AI libraries, and the code lacks any malicious constructs or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies. There are no anomalies, malicious code, or security threats identified.",
