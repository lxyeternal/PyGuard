  "purpose": "Importing version information and a module for lazy loading, likely part of package initialization.",
  "sources": "Reading __version__ from a relative module; importing GNautilus class or module for lazy loading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs; no sensitive data handling or external connections.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated elements present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python package initialization statements: future imports for compatibility, importing version info, and importing a class or module for lazy loading. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving standard package setup purposes. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
