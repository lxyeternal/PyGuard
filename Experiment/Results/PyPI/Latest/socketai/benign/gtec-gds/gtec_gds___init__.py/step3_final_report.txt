  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Static imports without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package __init__.py snippet, ensuring compatibility, importing version info, and setting up lazy loading. No dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. All signals indicate benign, standard package setup. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization snippet with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent.",
