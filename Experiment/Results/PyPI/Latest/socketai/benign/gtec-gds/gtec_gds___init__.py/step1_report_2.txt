  "purpose": "Importing version information and a component (GNautilus) for lazy loading, likely part of a package's initialization or setup.",
  "sources": "Importing __version__ from local module, importing GNautilus from local module g_nautilus.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output based on the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static imports are performed.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious code patterns. No indication of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard module imports, including future statements for compatibility, and imports specific components from local modules. No user input handling, network activity, or sensitive data processing observed. The code appears to be part of a typical package initialization file without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package setup code with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It primarily imports version info and a component for lazy loading, with no suspicious elements.",
