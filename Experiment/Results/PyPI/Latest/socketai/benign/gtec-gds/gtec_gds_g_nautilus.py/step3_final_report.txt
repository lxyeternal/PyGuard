{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface to GDS hardware devices, configuring device settings, managing data acquisition, and invoking user-defined callbacks for data processing.",
  "sources": "Device configuration methods, such as GetSupportedSensitivities(), GetImpedanceEx(), and internal device data streams.",
  "sinks": "User-provided callback functions that receive data arrays; device configuration and control functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from device methods (GetData, GetImpedanceEx) into callback functions supplied by the user; configuration flows during initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity; standard threading and device API usage.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts with hardware via a well-defined API, managing resources properly, and passing data to user callbacks without processing or transmitting data externally. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The callback input is untrusted, but this is typical for hardware data streams. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the callback trust model. The malware score is zero, and the obfuscation score is zero, indicating clear and straightforward code. The security risk score is slightly elevated (~0.2) due to untrusted callback handling but remains low overall.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward hardware interface for GDS devices with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
