{
  "purpose": "This code manages a device interface for data collection from GDS devices, providing initialization, configuration, data retrieval, and callback mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Reads device serial key, sampling rate, channel count, sensitivity, and callback function. Uses device methods to get supported sensitivities, data, and impedance.",
  "sinks": "Invokes user-provided callback with data. Calls device methods that may access hardware or data streams.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (serial, sampling rate, sensitivity) configure device settings. Device data is retrieved and passed to callback functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual or obfuscated code; device interactions are standard. No network activity or data exfiltration observed. Proper use of threading, no evident malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a device object, sets configurations based on input parameters, manages data acquisition via a thread, and invokes a callback with data. It performs expected operations for device handling and does not contain suspicious or malicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic detected. The only external interaction is with device hardware and user-defined callbacks. There are no network communications, data leaks, or security-sensitive operations that indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard device interface implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs device configuration, data retrieval, and callback invocation safely. There is no evidence of malware or security risks.",
