  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code simply assigns a version tuple and constructs a version string. There are no external inputs, dynamic code, or complex logic. The code's purpose is solely to define version information.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward code.  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct because there's no malicious activity.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely for version declaration with no external inputs, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted. The reports' scores of 0 are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**  \n   The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate. There is no indication of malicious intent or activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All claims are based on factual analysis of the code. No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration snippet with no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Since all reports agree and the code is straightforward, no further action or suspicion is warranted.",
