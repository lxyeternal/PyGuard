{
  "purpose": "Define the package version as a tuple and a string for version identification.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only sets internal variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; version information is statically assigned and combined.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very simple and does not contain unusual constructs or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a version tuple and creates a version string by joining its elements with dots. It contains no external inputs, no execution of dynamic code, and no suspicious logic. The simplicity indicates a standard version assignment pattern common in many packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
