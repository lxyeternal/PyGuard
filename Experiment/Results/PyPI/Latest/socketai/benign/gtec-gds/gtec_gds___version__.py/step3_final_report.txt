  "purpose": "Define the package version information statically for use within the project.",
  "sources": "Static tuple assignment to VERSION; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks as the code is static.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version assignment with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a tuple VERSION with fixed version numbers and creates a string __version__ by joining the tuple elements. It involves no external input, dynamic execution, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies, malicious behavior, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the static and transparent nature of the code. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security risks. The code is a common pattern for version declaration in Python packages, and the analysis confirms its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static version declaration snippet with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
