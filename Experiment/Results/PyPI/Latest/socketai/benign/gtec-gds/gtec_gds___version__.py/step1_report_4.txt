  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code derives version info from a hardcoded tuple.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow beyond setting __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version string construction from a static tuple.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a tuple representing version components and joins them into a string assigned to __version__. There is no input, no external data, and no suspicious or malicious logic. The code's purpose is to specify version information. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no potential for malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely setting version metadata with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
