  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates low malicious intent across most reports, with Report 4 showing moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic features. Slightly increasing the malware score for Report 4 from 0.3 to 0.4 is justified. The other reports are consistent with benign code. The scores are appropriate and reflect cautious analysis based on limited data."
