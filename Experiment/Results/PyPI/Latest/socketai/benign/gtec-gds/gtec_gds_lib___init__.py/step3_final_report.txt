  "purpose": "Analysis of supply chain security and malicious behavior in the provided Python code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user input, external files, or network connections; dynamic code execution points such as eval or exec.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through network transmission, file writes, or environment variable access; dynamic execution points that could execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or user input to sinks such as network or file operations, possibly through dynamic code execution or obfuscated code paths.",
  "anomalies": "Signs of obfuscation (e.g., high obfuscation scores), dynamic code execution (eval, exec), misleading variable names, complex or unnecessary dynamic features, lack of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity and assign low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 4 exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting higher suspicion. The scores are generally consistent with the descriptions, with slight adjustments recommended for Report 4's malware score to better reflect its signs of obfuscation and suspicion. The confidence levels align with the available information, and no false positives are indicated.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates low malicious intent across most reports, with Report 4 showing moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic features. Slightly increasing the malware score for Report 4 from 0.3 to 0.4 is justified. The other reports are consistent with benign code. The scores are appropriate and reflect cautious analysis based on limited data.",
