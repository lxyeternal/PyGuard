{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or manipulation, but without specific context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, potentially user input, or external configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to the console, writes to files, or sends data over network connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input functions into processing functions, then to output or network sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. No obfuscated code, but some dynamic code execution patterns are absent. No unusual or suspicious library usage noted.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python functions and libraries for input/output and data handling. No suspicious patterns such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or hidden backdoors are evident. The structure suggests legitimate data processing, with no signs of malicious behavior. However, the lack of specific context limits full certainty. No malicious or obfuscated code detected. The code adheres to normal practices with no security red flags.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be benign, performing standard data processing tasks without any malicious intent.",
