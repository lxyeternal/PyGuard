  "purpose": "Setup and configuration of a Flask Blueprint with suppression of specific warnings, dynamic loader function assignment, and version retrieval.",
  "sources": "Imports from dtale modules, warnings.catch_warnings context, LOADERS dictionary iteration, version info retrieval",
  "sinks": "Dynamic assignment of loader functions to globals, version info retrieval (external metadata)",
  "flows": "Loader functions from LOADERS assigned to globals, version info fetched via retrieve_meta_info_and_version",
  "anomalies": "Suppression of warnings that could hide deprecation issues, dynamic assignment of functions from trusted modules (not inherently suspicious), no external data input or network activity",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks for a Flask application component, including warning suppression, module imports, dynamic function assignment, and version info retrieval. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The dynamic assignment pattern is typical for plugin systems. Warning suppression, while potentially hiding deprecation notices, is common in legacy or setup scripts. Version retrieval from external metadata is standard, assuming trusted sources. No external inputs or network operations suggest malicious intent. The overall structure and content are benign, with no obfuscated code or malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for a Flask extension, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The dynamic function assignment and warning suppression are standard practices in such contexts. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
