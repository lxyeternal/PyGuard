  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the associated scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides data cleaning utilities with no malicious behavior, primarily generating code snippets for data replacement and imputation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is for data cleaning, with no malicious intent. The scores seem appropriate; the malware score is 0, and the risk is low given the code's nature. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on potential risks from dynamic code generation, but concludes no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe concern about dynamic code snippets is valid, but the code does not execute these snippets internally, only generates them. The scores are consistent; no malware detected, and the risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is for data replacement and imputation, with no signs of malicious activity. Dynamic code snippets are generated but not executed.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is accurate. The low risk score reflects the benign nature of the code. The malware score is correctly zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on data cleaning with code generation, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code's purpose is legitimate, and the scores align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code is for data cleaning with no malicious behavior, code snippets are generated for later execution.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe lowest risk score is appropriate, given the benign purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the potential concern about dynamic code generation, but this is standard in data processing pipelines and not inherently risky.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 – 0.2 (consistent with the reports, considering the code generates code snippets but does not execute them within this module)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is legitimate, standard for data cleaning, and does not pose security threats. The low risk scores are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores, as they accurately reflect the benign and standard nature of this data processing code.",
