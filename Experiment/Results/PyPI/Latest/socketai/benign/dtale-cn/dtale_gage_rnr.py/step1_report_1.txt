{
  "purpose": "The code implements statistical analysis for Gage R&R measurement system studies, calculating variances, standard deviations, and statistical tests based on input data.",
  "sources": "Reads input data through the constructor of GageRnR and Statistics classes, specifically from the 'data' parameter, which is a numpy 3D array.",
  "sinks": "Performs calculations using numpy and scipy libraries; no untrusted data sinks such as network, file, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input 'data' array into statistical calculations, leading to outputs of various statistical results such as F-values and p-values; no external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code uses standard libraries for statistical computations without obfuscation or unusual features. No signs of data leakage, system interference, or hidden malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly performs statistical analysis using numpy and scipy, without involving network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. It initializes with structured data, computes descriptive and inferential statistics, and outputs results. No suspicious data handling, input validation issues, or obfuscated code found. The code adheres to normal data processing practices for scientific computation. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate implementation of Gage R&R analysis without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Gage R&R statistical calculations with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It relies on trusted scientific libraries and performs typical data analysis functions without dangerous side effects.",
