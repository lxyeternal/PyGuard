{
  "purpose": "The code implements Gage R&R statistical analysis to evaluate measurement system variability, including calculations of means, variances, sum of squares, F-values, and p-values.",
  "sources": "The data array (3D numpy array) from which means, variances, and other statistics are derived; internal calculations do not read external sources.",
  "sinks": "Results are stored within class attributes; no external data sinks, network calls, or file outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input numpy array through various calculation methods (mean, variance, sum of squares, F-tests) to produce statistical results stored internally; no external untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard scientific libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Gage R&R calculations using numpy and scipy, with clear structure and no external system interactions. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious logic. The calculations follow accepted formulas, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected. The data flow is internal, and the code relies on trusted libraries. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign, scientific purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of Gage R&R analysis with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are justified and appropriate.",
