  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, cross-check the code and the scoring, and evaluate the potential risks step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior:**\n- All reports explicitly state that the code performs standard statistical calculations for Gage R&R analysis.\n- The code relies solely on trusted libraries (numpy, scipy).\n- No network, file I/O, or external system interactions are present.\n- No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are identified.\n\n**2. Code Functionality and Logic:**\n- The code implements standard statistical procedures: means, variances, sum of squares, F-tests, p-values.\n- The calculations follow typical formulas used in quality control and measurement system analysis.\n- The code structure (enums, classes, methods) is clean, well-organized, and typical for scientific computing.\n\n**3. Data Handling and External Interactions:**\n- Data flows only internally from input numpy arrays.\n- No external data sinks or outputs (like files or network) are observed.\n- The data is processed in-memory, and results are stored in class attributes.\n\n**4. Security and Malware Risk:**\n- Given the above, the code appears to be a legitimate scientific analysis module.\n- The reports' malware scores are all 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), reflecting the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n**5. Scores Justification:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- The overall security risk is minimal, consistent with the reports.\n\n**6. Any discrepancies or unreasonable scores?**\n- The scores seem reasonable and aligned with the code's behavior.\n- No need to adjust the scores based on the provided analysis.\n\n**7. Final Estimation:**\n- Malware score: **0.0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- Obfuscated score: **0.0** (clear, readable code)\n- Risk score: **0.1** (very low, primarily due to the potential for misuse if misapplied, but not malicious in itself)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, transparent implementation of Gage R&R statistical analysis. It does not exhibit any malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and should remain as they are.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Maintain the current scores: malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0, risk = 0.1.\n- No further adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, legitimate, and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
