{
  "purpose": "The code implements statistical analysis methods for Gage R&R (Repeatability and Reproducibility), which are used in quality control to assess measurement system variation.",
  "sources": "Input data array (numpy.ndarray) provided to the GageRnR class constructor; data attributes used within calculation methods.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external network connections observed; no outputs or data exfiltration mechanisms present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input data array through various calculation functions, including mean, variance, and F-value computations, but no untrusted external data is ingested or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code uses standard scientific libraries (numpy, scipy) for calculations. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious variable manipulations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Gage R&R statistical calculations. It defines enums for components and results, structures data processing via class methods, and performs statistical analysis without external interactions. The methods include calculation of degrees of freedom, sum of squares, variances, standard deviations, F-values, and p-values, all using standard mathematical and statistical libraries. No signs of malicious code, data leaks, or malicious network activity are present. The code appears intended solely for statistical quality control purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of Gage R&R analysis tools. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security risks. It functions as a scientific analysis module with no suspicious or harmful code features.",
