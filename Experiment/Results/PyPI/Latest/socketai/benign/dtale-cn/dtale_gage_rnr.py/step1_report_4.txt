{
  "purpose": "The code implements statistical analysis for Gage R&R measurement system studies, calculating various metrics such as means, variances, F-values, and p-values based on measurement data.",
  "sources": "Reads measurement data from a numpy 3D array passed during object initialization.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or external communications; calculations are performed internally on the data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input array through calculations of means, variances, and statistical tests within class methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. The code strictly performs statistical calculations with standard libraries (numpy, scipy). No suspicious data handling or external communication detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enums and classes for statistical calculations related to Gage R&R analysis. It uses numpy and scipy for data processing and statistical tests. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior is present. The data is processed in a straightforward manner, with no apparent malicious intent. All operations appear to be standard statistical computations; the code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Gage R&R statistical analysis, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It processes measurement data securely and predictably, with no external data leaks or harmful actions. Overall security risk is very low.",
