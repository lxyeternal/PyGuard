  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and security risks, as well as the logical consistency of their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code is standard, benign, and safe. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's purpose. No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Also finds the code benign, with no suspicious behaviors. Slightly notes a minimal security risk (0.1), possibly due to the code generating code snippets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** The mention of code snippets being generated is standard for debugging/documentation, not malicious. The low security risk score seems appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Acceptable; no change.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, no malicious intent or obfuscation. Slightly notes a security risk of 0.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Analysis:** The absence of any suspicious activity is consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No change.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard data analysis utility, no malicious behavior. Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1), justified by the code's dynamic code snippet generation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** Since the code only generates strings of code for formatting or documentation, and no external actions, this risk score is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No change.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, no malicious behavior, standard data analysis utility, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** Consistent with the code's functionality.\n\n**Verdict:** No change.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Observations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, justified by the code generating code snippets, which could be misused if taken out of context, but in this benign context, it’s acceptable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No modifications needed.\n- Given the comprehensive analysis, I agree with the assessments provided.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to code snippet generation, but still low risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard utility for data summarization with no security concerns. The current scoring reflects this accurately.",
