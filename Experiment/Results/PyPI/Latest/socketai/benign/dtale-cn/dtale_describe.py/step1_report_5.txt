  "purpose": "The code provides a helper function to generate descriptive statistics for a pandas Series, formatted for JSON serialization and includes code snippets for reproducibility or further processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from a pandas Series (`column_series`), accesses the Series' describe method, mode method, and other aggregations. Uses external utility functions `grid_formatter`, `grid_columns`, `json_int`, `json_float`.",
  "sinks": "None of the identified sinks directly involve untrusted data or potentially malicious actions. The code does not perform network operations, file writes, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input pandas Series -> `.describe()` and other aggregations -> formatting via external utilities -> output dictionary with statistics and code snippets.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code includes only standard data analysis and formatting operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that computes descriptive statistics for a pandas Series, including optional additional aggregations such as 'mode'. It formats these statistics using external utilities and constructs code snippets for reproducibility. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection. The external utility functions (`grid_formatter`, `grid_columns`, `json_int`, `json_float`) are presumed to be safe based on their naming and typical usage. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate data analysis utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for generating descriptive statistics with formatted output and code snippets. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
