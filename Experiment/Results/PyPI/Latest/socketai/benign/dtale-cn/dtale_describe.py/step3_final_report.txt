  "purpose": "Utility function to generate descriptive statistics for a pandas Series, including optional additional aggregations and formatted code snippets.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the pandas Series passed as 'column_series', and uses internal functions for formatting and JSON serialization.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data processed entirely in-memory, with generated code snippets as strings.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the pandas Series through describe(), mode(), and other aggregations, then into formatting functions and output dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; code is straightforward. Minor code snippet generation could be misused but is benign in context.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard pandas operations to compute descriptive statistics, formats output with custom formatter functions, and appends code snippets as strings for documentation. No external network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The generated code snippets are for formatting purposes only. The scoring of malware and obfuscation as zero is appropriate. The security risk score of 0.1 reflects the potential misuse of code snippets but is justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for descriptive statistics with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 is justified due to code snippet generation but does not indicate actual risk.",
