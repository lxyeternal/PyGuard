  "purpose": "Utility functions for generating descriptive statistics of pandas Series, including formatting and code generation for analysis.",
  "sources": "Input: pandas Series 'column_series'; Data from the Series such as 'describe()', 'mode()', 'isnull()', and 'len()'.",
  "sinks": "Generated 'code' strings that include DataFrame access and statistical method calls; modifications to 'desc' dictionary; potential use of external libraries (numpy, pandas).",
  "flows": "Input data flows from 'column_series' through pandas describe/mode/isnull methods to populate 'desc' and 'code'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors identified. The code dynamically constructs code snippets, which could be used maliciously if misused, but in this context appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a descriptive statistics report for a pandas Series, formats the output, and generates executable code snippets as strings. It uses numpy and pandas functions appropriately, adds custom formatting via 'grid_formatter', and calculates missing data statistics. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, no network activity, or data leaks. The use of string formatting for code generation is standard for dynamic code creation, not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility for statistical data analysis with formatting features. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, and no security risks are apparent beyond normal data handling. The code appears safe and well-structured.",
