{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to combine multiple datasets either by merging or stacking, and generate corresponding code snippets for data manipulation using pandas and dtale.",
  "sources": "Data is read from global_state.get_data(dataset['dataId']) and from configuration inputs provided to class constructors; code generation functions also process dataset metadata.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe code injection in build_code functions where generated code strings are executed or evaluated elsewhere, but within this code, no direct execution of untrusted code occurs.",
  "flows": "Data is read from global_state and configuration, processed into pandas DataFrames, then merged or concatenated based on user-defined settings; code snippets are built as strings that reflect these operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network connections, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be straightforward data processing with code generation, no hidden or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code reads datasets via global_state.get_data, allowing external data injection, which could be manipulated if the global_state function is compromised. Data is merged or stacked based on user configuration, with no evidence of malicious data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The build_code functions generate code strings that could be used elsewhere, but there is no execution of untrusted code within this script. The code handles parameters safely and does not evaluate or execute user-provided code dynamically. Overall, the script is focused on data processing and code generation for pandas DataFrames, with no indications of malicious intent or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data processing utility with code generation features. There are no signs of malware, malicious backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Its main risk lies in the reliance on external data sources via global_state, which could be manipulated outside this code, but the code itself does not introduce malicious behavior.",
