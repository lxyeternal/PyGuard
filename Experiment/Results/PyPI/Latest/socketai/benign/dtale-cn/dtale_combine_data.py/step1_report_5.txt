{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to build and merge or stack datasets using pandas DataFrames, and to generate corresponding dtale code snippets for visualization.",
  "sources": "Data is fetched via global_state.get_data(dataset['dataId']). Data is read from datasets, columns, and index parameters.",
  "sinks": "Generated code that calls dtale.get_instance and pandas DataFrame merge or concat methods.",
  "flows": "Data flows from global_state.get_data() into pandas DataFrame operations, then into dtale visualization instances.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic detected. Usage of dtale and pandas appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The script loads configuration and datasets from input, constructs dataframes via build_df, and generates code to visualize data using dtale. MergeBuilder and StackBuilder build dataframes via pandas merge and concat, with dynamic parameters. The code constructs Python code snippets for data visualization but does not execute any untrusted input directly, other than assembling code strings. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The use of dtale and pandas is standard for data analysis workflows. The code relies on external global state and user-provided configuration for dataset parameters, but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data handling and visualization utility without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any operations that would indicate malware or security risks based on its content.",
