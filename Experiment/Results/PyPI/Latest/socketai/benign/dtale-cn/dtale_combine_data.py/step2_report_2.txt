  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's function of combining datasets via merge/stack, fetching data via `global_state.get_data`, and reading configs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Appropriately notes that code generates strings for pandas and dtale operations, not executing untrusted code directly.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no secrets, no code injection. The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; the code appears legitimate with a high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, which is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing data visualization with dtale, no malicious activity, standard dynamic string building.\n- Correctly notes that no code executes untrusted code directly.\n- Confidence is high (0.9), malware is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on data merging and visualization, no suspicious behaviors.\n- Notes that code constructs code snippets but does not execute untrusted code.\n- High confidence (1), malware 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Highlights data fetched via `global_state.get_data()`, potential external data manipulation point.\n- Correctly states that no malicious code is executed within this script.\n- The only concern is the reliance on external data source, which could be manipulated outside this code, but the code itself is safe.\n- Confidence is 0.9, malware 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; no issues with the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar to others, describes the code as a data utility generating code snippets, with no malicious behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious activity.\n- Confidence is 0.9, malware 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No. The code is straightforward, constructs code strings for pandas and dtale, and fetches data via a controlled interface.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** No significant logical flaws. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the static analysis.\n- **Risk scores:** Generally low (0.2), justified by the external data source dependency, but not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Should stay low (~0.2), acknowledging external data dependency but no inherent malicious risk.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to reliance on external data, but not malicious)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate data processing utility with code generation features, no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.",
