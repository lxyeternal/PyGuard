  "purpose": "Generate pandas DataFrames via merging or stacking based on configuration and datasets, and produce code snippets for visualization using dtale.",
  "sources": "Data fetched from global_state.get_data() based on dataset identifiers.",
  "sinks": "Generated code strings for pandas and dtale operations; no execution of untrusted code occurs within this script.",
  "flows": "Data is retrieved via global_state.get_data() (source), then code strings are constructed for pandas and dtale functions (sink), without executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs code snippets for pandas DataFrame merging and stacking, and for dtale visualization, based on provided configurations and datasets. It fetches data via a controlled interface, then builds string representations of code for later execution, but does not execute untrusted code directly. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the static analysis, considering external data dependencies but no internal malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data processing utility with dynamic code generation for visualization, exhibiting no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk score appropriately reflects minimal security concerns, primarily related to external data source trustworthiness, which is outside the scope of static code analysis.",
