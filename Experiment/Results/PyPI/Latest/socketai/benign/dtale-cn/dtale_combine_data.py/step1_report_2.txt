{
  "purpose": "The code facilitates the merging and stacking of datasets in pandas, generating corresponding dtale code snippets for visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads input data via global_state.get_data() and configuration data via JSON.loads().",
  "sinks": "Uses dtale.get_instance() to access dataset instances; constructs code strings for data manipulation and visualization.",
  "flows": "Input data from global_state.get_data() flows into pandas DataFrame manipulations; code strings generated to invoke dtale instances; merging and concatenation flows rely on config parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Code constructs code strings dynamically for dtale visualization; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no evident obfuscated code or malicious intent. Use of dynamic string formatting in code generation is standard for such tools.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads configuration and datasets, builds pandas DataFrames, and generates code snippets for dtale visualization. MergeBuilder and StackBuilder use configuration parameters for merge/join operations, relying on user input. Data is fetched via global_state.get_data() which is a controlled point. The code does not contain any network operations, system modifications, or obfuscated code. All dynamic code generation pertains to pandas and dtale functions, which is standard for data analysis workflows. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard data manipulation and visualization utility, with no malicious intent. The dynamic code generation and data handling are typical for such tools, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
