  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the appropriateness of the scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a data manipulation utility that generates pandas and dtale code snippets, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Analysis:** Static analysis confirms no hardcoded secrets, code injection, or malicious activity. Dynamic code generation is controlled and based on configurations.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem reasonable given the code's nature. The low risk score reflects minimal concern, consistent with the report.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on pandas and dtale, with no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis:** No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code. Dynamic code strings are for visualization, not execution of untrusted code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—standard data processing with code generation for visualization, no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code constructs code snippets for pandas and dtale, which is typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.0 are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on data merging/stacking with code generation, relying on external data via `global_state.get_data()`.\n- **Analysis:** The main concern is external data source manipulation, but within this code, no malicious activity is evident. No code injection or network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Standard data processing and visualization code, with no obfuscation or malware indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate 0, which aligns with the static analysis—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0.2, reflecting low but non-zero concern primarily due to reliance on external data sources (`global_state.get_data()`) which could be manipulated outside this code's scope.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The **risk scores** are reasonable; however, if the global_state or input configurations are untrusted, the risk could be slightly higher, but within this code, no direct malicious activity is present.\n- The **malware score** remains at 0; no evidence suggests malicious intent.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, as the code is straightforward.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with reports, but keep in mind external data sources could pose a risk if compromised)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the code appears safe based on static analysis. No modifications to scores are necessary unless external factors (like the trustworthiness of `global_state`) are considered.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always consider runtime behaviors and environment security, especially with external data sources, but based solely on static code review, the assessments are justified.",
