  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code. Then, I'll synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code constructs data manipulation code snippets using pandas and dtale, fetching data via `global_state.get_data()`. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The analysis is thorough, emphasizing that the code generates code strings but does not execute untrusted code directly.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. The code is primarily a utility for generating pandas/dtale code snippets based on configurations, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing data visualization with dtale, safe data handling, and no malicious intent. No obfuscation or malware detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. The dynamic string generation is standard for visualization code snippets.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on data merging and stacking, generating code snippets for pandas and dtale. No malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code's dynamic string creation is deemed safe and intended.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning matches the code. No suspicious activities are identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, highlights data merging/stacking and code generation. Notes that data is fetched via `global_state.get_data()`, which could be manipulated if the global state is compromised, but the code itself is safe.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is a utility for data processing with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the same points: data merging/stacking, code generation for visualization, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code does not contain actual malicious code, obfuscation, or security flaws. It constructs code snippets for pandas and dtale operations based on configurations and data fetched from a controlled global state.\n\n- **Malware Score Justification:** The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the static analysis. The code does not perform any network activity, code injection, or execute untrusted code directly.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero obfuscation is appropriate; the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are mostly 0.2, reflecting a low security risk mainly due to reliance on external data sources (`global_state.get_data()`), which could be manipulated if the global state is compromised, but this is outside the scope of this code's logic.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n- No adjustments are necessary unless the context of `global_state.get_data()` is considered insecure, but that is outside this code's scope.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — Low, due to external data dependency, but no direct security flaws.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard utility for data merging, stacking, and visualization code generation, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The current scoring is appropriate and justified.",
