{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to check pandas library versions and perform groupby operations with version-aware behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads the pandas library version (pd.__version__), reads the attribute 'groupby' from dataframes, and reads logger configurations.",
  "sinks": "Uses getattr to invoke a method specified by 'calc_name' on an object, which could execute arbitrary code if 'calc_name' is controlled externally.",
  "flows": "Input: 'obj' and 'calc_name' to run_function; source of 'calc_name' from external or internal input, flow to getattr execution; logger for exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute invocation with 'getattr' without input validation; no evident malicious intent but potential for misuse if 'calc_name' is externally controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code checks pandas version compatibility and constructs groupby strings based on version. The run_function dynamically calls a method on an object based on a string name. While generally benign, the use of 'getattr' with external input could pose risks if 'calc_name' is not sanitized. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Version checks and string formatting are standard. No suspicious network activity or file manipulation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve as a utility for pandas version compatibility and dynamic method invocation. The use of 'getattr' could be risky if 'calc_name' originates from untrusted sources, but in this isolated code, no malicious intent is evident. No malware or malicious behavior identified.",
