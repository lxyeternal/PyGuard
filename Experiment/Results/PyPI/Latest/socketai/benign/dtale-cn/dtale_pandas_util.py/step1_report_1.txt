{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for checking pandas library versions, grouping dataframes, and dynamically executing object methods, primarily for data analysis workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads pandas version information (`pd.__version__`), function parameters (`version_number`, `index`, `dropna`, `calc_name`), and object attributes (`hasattr`, `getattr`).",
  "sinks": "Calls `groupby` methods on dataframes, dynamic method invocation via `getattr`, logging debug messages.",
  "flows": "Version check functions read pandas version; `groupby` functions generate code snippets or call pandas methods; `run_function` dynamically invokes methods on objects based on string names.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Use of dynamic method invocation is typical but warrants attention, though here it appears controlled and limited to method calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to check pandas versions, generate groupby code snippets, and run object methods dynamically. It uses standard libraries and pandas without obfuscated or malicious constructs. The dynamic method invocation is bounded and related to data processing, not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or file manipulations are present. The code structure is straightforward, and all functions serve typical data analysis purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for pandas version checking and dynamic method execution. There are no signs of malicious intent or malware, and no security risks identified based on the provided code.",
