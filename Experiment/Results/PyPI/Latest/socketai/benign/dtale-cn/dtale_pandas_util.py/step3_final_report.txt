  "purpose": "Utility functions for pandas version checks, dynamic method invocation, and code snippet generation for groupby operations.",
  "sources": "Reads pandas version via pd.__version__, accesses object attributes via hasattr and getattr, generates code snippets through string formatting.",
  "sinks": "Potential invocation of arbitrary methods via getattr, string formatting for code snippets (not executed), no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Version check functions compare pd.__version__ to target versions; run_function uses getattr to invoke methods; groupby_code generates code strings based on input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic getattr with external input could be risky if inputs are untrusted; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module for pandas version checks, dynamic method invocation, and code generation. All patterns are standard and controlled; no malicious payloads or backdoors are present. The dynamic attribute access via getattr is limited to existing attributes, reducing risk, but if inputs are externally controlled without validation, it could be misused. The string formatting in groupby_code is for code snippets, not execution, and appears safe. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk, with scores reflecting controlled dynamic invocation. No signs of malware or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, version-aware pandas utility module with controlled dynamic method invocation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain issues are present. The assigned scores are appropriate, with a very low security risk primarily due to the use of dynamic getattr, which should be validated if inputs are untrusted. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in data analysis workflows.",
