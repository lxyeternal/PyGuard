{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for version checking and grouping operations on pandas DataFrames, along with a generic function to invoke methods by name.",
  "sources": "Reads pandas version from the pandas library (__version__), reads method existence with hasattr, and retrieves methods using getattr.",
  "sinks": "Calls dynamically retrieved methods (e.g., df.groupby) which could execute untrusted code if manipulated, but in this context it appears to operate on pandas DataFrame objects passed as parameters.",
  "flows": "The run_function takes an object and a method name, then calls that method if it exists, which could invoke any method on the object; the groupby functions generate strings or perform grouping based on input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns. Use of dynamic method invocation could be misused if inputs are manipulated, but within this code, no malicious intent is evident. The string formatting in groupby_code appears safe, as it's used for code generation rather than execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs version checks and wraps pandas DataFrame groupby operations, with dynamic method invocation via getattr. There is no evidence of malicious code or backdoors. The dynamic method call could potentially invoke unintended methods if input is maliciously crafted, but in this context, it assumes trusted object references. No suspicious external network activity, data leakage, or malicious payloads are present. The code's structure and content are straightforward and consistent with standard utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for pandas version checking and DataFrame grouping. No malicious behavior or malware indicators are evident. The dynamic method invocation is a potential vector if misused, but in this isolated context, it is not malicious.",
