  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, version-aware pandas utility module with controlled dynamic method invocation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain issues are present. The assigned scores are appropriate, with a very low security risk primarily due to the use of dynamic getattr, which should be validated if inputs are untrusted. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in data analysis workflows."
