{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions for exporting and constructing Python code snippets related to data visualization and data manipulation within the D-Tale framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from global_state.get_history, global_state.get_settings, global_state.get_context_variables, and global_state.get_dataset methods, as well as data_id input parameters and internal function arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code generates code strings that execute data queries and manipulate pandas dataframes, including calling pandas methods like reset_index(), drop(), set_index(), and query().",
  "flows": "Input data (data_id, query, settings) flows from function parameters and global_state methods into code strings, which are assembled into scripts that execute data manipulations and queries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code primarily constructs code snippets and manipulates dataframes based on provided configurations. No network communication, file system access, or suspicious obfuscation is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs dynamic Python scripts for data analysis and visualization export, based on data stored in a global state object. It reads configuration and data information, builds code snippets for data processing, and appends export instructions. The logic appears to be designed for flexible code generation without executing untrusted code directly. There are no indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or covert channels. The code relies on standard pandas and Python functions, and the logic is straightforward. Overall, it functions as a code generator within a data analysis context, with no suspicious or malicious components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for generating data analysis and visualization scripts within the D-Tale framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It strictly constructs code based on user configurations and stored global state, with no evidence of harmful intent.",
