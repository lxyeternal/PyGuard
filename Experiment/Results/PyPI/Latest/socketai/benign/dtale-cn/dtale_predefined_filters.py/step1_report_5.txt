{
  "purpose": "Define and manage a collection of predefined filters with validation and utility functions.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only internal code and parameters passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed from untrusted sources or written to insecure sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly manipulates in-memory objects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert' statements for validation; no explicit security issues but assertions can be disabled, potentially leading to bypass of validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for filters with validation on initialization, including callability checks and signature validation. It manages a global list of filters, providing functions to get, set, add, and initialize filters. There are no external data sources or sinks, and no execution of untrusted code. The use of assertions for validation is not inherently malicious but can be bypassed if assertions are disabled in production environments. No hardcoded secrets, no code injection points, no suspicious network activity, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for managing filter objects with validation. It does not contain malware or security risks. The only minor concern is reliance on 'assert' for critical validation, which is not security-proof. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
