{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to load various datasets, including COVID-19 data, Seinfeld episode data, Simpsons data, video game sales, movies, and time series data, primarily from external URLs and ZIP files.",
  "sources": "External URLs via requests.get and load_csv calls; data from CSV files and ZIP archives; environment variables and external libraries.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs from functions; no direct data sinks such as file writes or network transmissions from untrusted sources are evident; the code primarily reads and processes data.",
  "flows": "Input URLs and ZIP responses flow into data parsing functions; loaded data is processed and returned; no untrusted data is transmitted or stored externally.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated import of dtale modules; use of dynamic code execution is limited to pandas DataFrame operations; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code paths detected; usage of lambda functions for HTML formatting is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code predominantly fetches data from well-known, publicly accessible URLs and processes it using standard pandas and requests libraries. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. The code does not perform any network communication beyond initial data fetch, nor does it write or transmit sensitive data elsewhere. There are no indications of malicious backdoors, credential theft, or covert data exfiltration. The inclusion of dynamic DataFrame manipulations and use of external data sources appear to serve legitimate data analysis purposes. The repeated import of the dtale module and setting app settings are benign. Overall, the code appears to be a collection of data loading functions for data analysis, with no malicious intent or security risks evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for data loading and processing with external datasets. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected. It performs legitimate data retrieval and transformation tasks typical in data analysis workflows.",
