  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Functions load datasets from public URLs, using load_csv and requests. No untrusted data sinks are identified.\n- **Anomalies:** Repeated import of dtale modules; no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is for data loading and processing, with no malicious activity. The confidence is high (0.9), malware score is 0, security risk is 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** No issues found; scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, loading datasets from public URLs, ZIP files, etc.\n- **Anomalies:** Unusual import placement, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe data loading functions, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Data from public URLs, including CSVs and ZIPs.\n- **Anomalies:** Repeated import statements, use of global_state.set_app_settings.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; mainly data loading.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0, confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar data loading from public URLs.\n- **Anomalies:** Repeated imports, reliance on external URLs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; standard data loading.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—public datasets, no suspicious code.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of third-party loaders, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Judgment:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports correctly assign malware score 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or covert exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Given that all functions fetch data from public, reputable sources and perform benign data processing, the overall security risk remains very low. The slightly elevated risk scores (~0.2) are justified by reliance on external URLs, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The repeated import of modules within functions is unusual but not malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- No network activity beyond initial data fetch, no data exfiltration, command execution, or code injection.\n- The code's purpose is purely data loading and transformation for analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the findings.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the reliance on external sources but no malicious activity, a conservative but justified score would be around **0.1 to 0.2**.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n| **0**     | **0**       | **0.1** |\n\nThis reflects a benign, transparent data loading code with minimal security concerns, primarily related to external dependencies rather than malicious intent.",
