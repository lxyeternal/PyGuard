{
  "purpose": "The code loads various datasets from public URLs, processes them using pandas, and performs data merging and transformation for analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "HTTP requests to fetch CSV and ZIP files, loading data into pandas DataFrames, reading from external URLs and ZIP archives.",
  "sinks": "Data is stored in pandas DataFrames within memory; no data is transmitted externally or executed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external URLs into pandas DataFrames through requests and load_csv functions, with no untrusted data affecting system operations beyond initial fetch.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated import statements within functions, use of global state modifications, but no obfuscation or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data loading and processing tasks from public sources. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is present. The repeated imports and use of third-party libraries are benign. The code's purpose is transparent, and no malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of benign data loaders for analysis, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reliance on external URLs is typical for data analysis scripts but warrants standard caution. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, justified by external dependencies but no malicious activity.",
