  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of benign data loaders for analysis, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reliance on external URLs is typical for data analysis scripts but warrants standard caution. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, justified by external dependencies but no malicious activity."
