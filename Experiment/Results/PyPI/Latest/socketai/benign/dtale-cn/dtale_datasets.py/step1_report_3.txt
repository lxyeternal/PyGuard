{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to load various datasets from remote URLs, including COVID-19 data, Seinfeld scripts, Simpsons episodes, video game sales, movies, and time series data.",
  "sources": [
    "Requests to fetch zip files and CSV data from URLs",
    "Loading CSV files using dtale's loader_func from specified URLs",
    "Fetching zip archives with requests.get() and reading their contents",
    "Random number generation for creating sample data"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "Reading CSV files from URLs using pandas.read_csv",
    "Using requests.get() to download data",
    "Modifying DataFrame contents and setting global state in dtale",
    "Applying functions to DataFrame columns for image URL formatting"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "URL fetch via load_csv functions → DataFrame processing",
    "requests.get() response → zipfile.ZipFile → extracting files",
    "Random number generation → DataFrame creation"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Repeated import of load_csv within multiple functions (not malicious but unusual for efficiency)",
    "Use of global_state.set_app_settings in the Simpsons function (may be unnecessary outside a controlled environment)",
    "In movies(), setting 'year' to 2019 for TV Movies, which might be a data correction but not inherently suspicious",
    "No hardcoded credentials, no apparent backdoors, no suspicious network activity",
    "No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution or misleading variable names",
    "All network requests are fetching public datasets; no user input or untrusted sources other than these URLs"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads datasets from publicly available URLs, processes them using pandas, and applies minimal transformations. All data sources are from reputable or public repositories. No code appears to execute untrusted or malicious commands. No hidden network activity, credential theft, or backdoors are present. The only noteworthy point is the repeated importing of load_csv and setting global state, which is not suspicious but could be optimized. Overall, the code seems safe, with no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is safe, with no signs of malware or malicious activity. It functions as a data loader and processor for various datasets from public sources. No security risks are identified.",
