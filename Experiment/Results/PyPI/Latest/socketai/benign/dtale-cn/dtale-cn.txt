      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, version-aware pandas utility module with controlled dynamic method invocation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain issues are present. The assigned scores are appropriate, with a very low security risk primarily due to the use of dynamic getattr, which should be validated if inputs are untrusted. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in data analysis workflows."

      "conclusion": "The code is a collection of benign data loaders for analysis, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reliance on external URLs is typical for data analysis scripts but warrants standard caution. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, justified by external dependencies but no malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data processing utility with dynamic code generation for visualization, exhibiting no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk score appropriately reflects minimal security concerns, primarily related to external data source trustworthiness, which is outside the scope of static code analysis."
