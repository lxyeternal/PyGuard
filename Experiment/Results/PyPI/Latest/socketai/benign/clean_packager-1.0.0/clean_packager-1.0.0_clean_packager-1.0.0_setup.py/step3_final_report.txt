{
  "purpose": "The code loads and executes code from 'zip.zip' during installation without validation, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "sources": "Reading 'zip.zip' via zipimport and executing 'hello()' from the imported module.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'module.hello()' which runs code from the external archive.",
  "flows": "Loading 'zip.zip' with zipimport -> creating module spec -> executing module code -> calling 'hello()'.",
  "anomalies": "No validation or signature verification of 'zip.zip'; executing external code during setup is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads and executes an external zip archive during installation without any validation, creating a high security risk. This pattern can be exploited if 'zip.zip' contains malicious code, leading to potential supply chain attacks. The behavior is straightforward but dangerous, as it allows arbitrary code execution at a critical point in the package lifecycle.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk behavior by executing untrusted external code during setup without validation. While no malicious payload is confirmed, the mechanism itself is a significant security concern, making the package potentially dangerous in untrusted environments.",
