{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package and overrides the install command to execute a test function that loads and runs a module from a zip archive.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file; loading 'zip.zip' via zipimport; executing the module's hello() function",
  "sinks": "Executing 'zip.zip' module's hello() function, which could potentially be malicious if the module contains harmful code",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> executing zipimporter -> loading 'zip.zip' -> calling module.hello()",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import from a zip archive and execution of a function within it; no validation of the zip content; no indication of what 'hello()' does",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file and defines a custom install command that, during installation, imports a module from 'zip.zip' and executes its hello() method. The code relies on dynamic module loading from an external zip archive without validation, which could be malicious if the zip archive contains harmful code. The setup configuration is standard but the invocation of code from an external archive during installation is suspicious. The code does not include any input validation, encryption, or data exfiltration mechanisms explicitly but executing code from an external archive without validation introduces a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a seemingly normal setup operation but executes code from an external zip archive during installation without validation. This behavior could be malicious if the archive contains harmful code, making it a potential supply chain risk.",
