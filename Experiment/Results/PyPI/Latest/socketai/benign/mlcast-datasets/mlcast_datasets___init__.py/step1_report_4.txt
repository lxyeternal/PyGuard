  "purpose": "To retrieve the version of the package and open a dataset catalog resource within the package.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version (__name__), pkg_resources.path (mlcast_datasets.catalog, catalog.yml)",
  "sinks": "intake.open_catalog (uses catalog.yml path)",
  "flows": "version retrieval from package metadata -> accessing catalog.yml via pkg_resources -> opening catalog with intake",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code; straightforward resource access and version retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves its own package version and accesses a YAML catalog resource using standard library functions, then opens this catalog via intake. Both operations are standard for package resource handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident, and no data leaks or external communications are present. The code does not perform any data processing or network activity beyond reading local resources.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs routine package resource management and version detection without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
