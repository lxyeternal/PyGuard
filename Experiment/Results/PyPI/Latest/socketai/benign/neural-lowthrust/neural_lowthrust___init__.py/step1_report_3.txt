{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package by importing a submodule and exposing its symbols at the package level, with version information included.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from . import nn_lowthrust as _ext'. Access to _ext.__dict__ for symbol exposure.",
  "sinks": "Updating globals with _ext.__dict__ may expose all symbols from the submodule, but no untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "flows": "Importing _ext and updating globals with its dictionary, then filtering symbols for __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a local submodule and exposes its contents at the package level, which is standard practice in Python package initialization. It assigns the package version. No data input, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard package initialization without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It simply exposes symbols from a submodule and sets version info.",
