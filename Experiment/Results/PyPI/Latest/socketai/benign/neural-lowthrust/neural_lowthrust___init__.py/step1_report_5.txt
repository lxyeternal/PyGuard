{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a Python package by importing a submodule and exposing its symbols at the package level, while setting a version number.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from . import nn_lowthrust as _ext",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leakage or code execution.",
  "flows": "Import _ext -> globals().update(_ext.__dict__) -> exposing symbols in __all__",
  "anomalies": "Use of globals().update() to expose submodule symbols at the package top level is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves to import a submodule named 'nn_lowthrust' and expose its public symbols at the package level, while maintaining version consistency. It does not perform any data input/output, network operations, or system modifications. The use of globals().update() to dynamically expose module symbols is a design choice that could be unusual in some contexts but does not suggest malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization script that imports a compiled extension module and exposes its symbols. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign.",
