{
  "purpose": "Import an extension module (nn_lowthrust) and expose its symbols at the package level, setting version to 0.1.0.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from . import nn_lowthrust as _ext",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data output or network communication present",
  "flows": "Import of extension module → update globals with extension's attributes → define __all__ and __version__",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual constructs; straightforward module import and symbol exposure",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local extension module named nn_lowthrust, then exposes its symbols globally within the package, and sets a version string. The import is from a relative module, which is standard for Python packages. No data handling, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The code appears to serve a typical package initialization purpose without any malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard package initialization tasks, importing an extension module and exposing its symbols. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
