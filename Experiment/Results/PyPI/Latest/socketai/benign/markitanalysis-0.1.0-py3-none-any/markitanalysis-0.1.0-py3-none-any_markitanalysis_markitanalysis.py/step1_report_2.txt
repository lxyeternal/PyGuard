  "purpose": "Fetch and display the public IP address of the system by querying an external API.",
  "sources": "requests.get() function call to 'https://api.ipify.org?format=text' for obtaining public IP; reading the response text.",
  "sinks": "Printing the response text to the console; no data leakage outside of standard output.",
  "flows": "Source: requests.get() fetches data from the external API; Sink: print statement outputs the data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of verify=False disables SSL certificate verification, which is insecure but not malicious per se; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses the requests library to fetch the system's public IP address from an external API (api.ipify.org). It suppresses SSL verification warnings and disables SSL verification for the request, which reduces security but is a common workaround. The response is printed directly to standard output. No code appears to be attempting to exfiltrate data or perform malicious actions; the function serves a benign purpose. There are no hidden backdoors, no suspicious data flows, or malicious behaviors detected. The only concern is the insecure SSL verification, which is a security risk but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended to fetch and display the public IP address. It contains no malicious intent or malicious code, but it disables SSL verification, which poses a security risk. Overall, it appears benign with a minor security concern.",
