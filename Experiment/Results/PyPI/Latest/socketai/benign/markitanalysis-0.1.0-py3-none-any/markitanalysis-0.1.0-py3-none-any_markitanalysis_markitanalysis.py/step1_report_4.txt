{
  "purpose": "Fetch and display the system's public IP address using an HTTP GET request.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from an external URL 'https://api.ipify.org?format=text' via requests.get().",
  "sinks": "The response text is printed directly to the console; no data is stored or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The source is the URL request; the sink is the print statement displaying the response text.",
  "anomalies": "The code suppresses SSL verification warnings and disables SSL certificate verification (verify=False), which can be exploited for man-in-the-middle attacks; however, no malicious behavior or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code makes an HTTP GET request to an external API to retrieve the public IP address. It disables SSL verification and suppresses related warnings, which can expose the request to interception or tampering. Despite this, it only prints the fetched IP address without sending or storing sensitive data elsewhere. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The main concern is insecure SSL handling, which is a common security best practice violation, but not malicious per se.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, intended to fetch and display the public IP address, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. The only security concern is the intentional disabling of SSL verification, which can be risky but does not constitute malicious behavior.",
