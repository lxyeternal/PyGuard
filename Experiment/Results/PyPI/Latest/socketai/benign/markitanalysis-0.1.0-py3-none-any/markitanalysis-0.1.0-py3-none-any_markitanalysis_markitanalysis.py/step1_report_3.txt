  "purpose": "The code fetches and displays the public IP address of the machine executing it using the requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from an external URL 'https://api.ipify.org?format=text' via requests.get.",
  "sinks": "The response text (public IP address) is printed to the console, which is a benign sink in this context.",
  "flows": "Source: External URL request -> Response object -> Response text -> Print statement.",
  "anomalies": "Suppresses SSL warnings and disables SSL verification ('verify=False'), which is unusual and can be exploited for man-in-the-middle attacks. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports requests and disables SSL warnings, then makes an HTTP GET request to a public API to retrieve the machine's public IP address, printing the result. The use of 'verify=False' suppresses SSL certificate validation, which can be risky as it allows potentially compromised or malicious certificates. The code does not contain malicious actions like data exfiltration or backdoors, but the decision to disable SSL verification could be exploited in a malicious context. No other suspicious behavior or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign function—fetching and displaying the public IP address—yet the suppression of SSL verification is a security concern. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malware, but the insecure SSL handling is noteworthy.",
