  "purpose": "Fetches and displays the public IP address using the requests library, with insecure SSL verification disabled.",

  "sinks": "Printing response.text to console",
  "flows": "HTTP request to response handling and printing",
  "anomalies": "Use of verify=False disables SSL certificate verification; suppression of SSL warnings",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward HTTP GET request to an external API to retrieve the public IP address. It suppresses SSL warnings and disables SSL verification, which introduces a security risk by making the request susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. Exception handling is appropriate. The main concern is the insecure SSL handling, which is a security misconfiguration rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs its intended function without malicious intent. The primary security concern is the use of verify=False, which should be avoided in production environments. The code does not contain malware or obfuscation. The overall security risk score is moderate due to insecure SSL handling, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior.",
