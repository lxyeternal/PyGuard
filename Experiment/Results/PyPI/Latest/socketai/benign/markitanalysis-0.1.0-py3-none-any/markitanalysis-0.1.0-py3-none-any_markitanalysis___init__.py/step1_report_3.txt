  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'welcome' from a local module and exposes it via __all__, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and minimal, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
