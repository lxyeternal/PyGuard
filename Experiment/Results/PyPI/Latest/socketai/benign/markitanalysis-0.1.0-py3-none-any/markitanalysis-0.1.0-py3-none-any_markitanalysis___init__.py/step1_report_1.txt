{
  "purpose": "This code imports a function named 'welcome' from a local module 'markitanalysis' and exposes it publicly via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'welcome' from a relative module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the import does not process data",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution",
  "analysis": "The code's purpose appears to be to expose the 'welcome' function from the local 'markitanalysis' module. It uses relative import syntax, which is standard in Python packages. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious code patterns. The code structure is clean and typical for module exports. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain tampering, or security risks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign module that exports a function from a local module. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
