  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function called 'welcome' from a local module '.markitanalysis' and then explicitly exports it via __all__. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. The code appears to serve a simple purpose of re-exporting a function for package exports. No data handling, network operations, or other risky behaviors are present.",
