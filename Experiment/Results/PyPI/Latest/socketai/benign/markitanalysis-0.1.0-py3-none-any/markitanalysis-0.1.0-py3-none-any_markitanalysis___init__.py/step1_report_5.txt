  "purpose": "The code exports the 'welcome' function from the 'markitanalysis' module, likely to be used elsewhere in the package or project.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .markitanalysis import welcome",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present; simple import and export statement",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module re-export, importing 'welcome' from a relative module and defining '__all__' for export. It contains no dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or external network activity. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, standard for Python packages that re-export selected functions or classes. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
