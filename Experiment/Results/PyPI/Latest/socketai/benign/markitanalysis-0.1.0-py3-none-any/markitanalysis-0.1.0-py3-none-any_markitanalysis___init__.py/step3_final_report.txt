  "purpose": "Re-exporting the 'welcome' function from the local 'markitanalysis' module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .markitanalysis module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or output",
  "flows": "Import of 'welcome' from local module to __all__ export; no data flow beyond module scope",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, straightforward, and standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function 'welcome' from a local module and exposes it via __all__, serving as a re-export. No dynamic code execution, data handling, or external communication is present. The code is clear, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. The code's simplicity and standard pattern confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward nature. No modifications are necessary.",
