{
  "purpose": "The code re-exports the 'welcome' function or variable from the '.markitanalysis' module, likely for simplifying imports or exposing a public API.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import statement from the local module '.markitanalysis'.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data outputs in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink path exists; the code only performs an import and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement and a declaration of __all__, which is a common pattern for module exports. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no potentially dangerous operations. The simplicity and standard pattern do not suggest malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign code used for re-exporting a symbol from a local module. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are present.",
