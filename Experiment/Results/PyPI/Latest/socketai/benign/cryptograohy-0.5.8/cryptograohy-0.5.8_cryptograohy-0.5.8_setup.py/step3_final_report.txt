{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup installation process that fetches build dependencies and performs a post-install action involving dynamic import of a third-party package, with error logging.",
  "sources": "fetch_build_eggs method, dynamic import of 'pyprettifier', exception handling block writing to '/tmp/.install-error.log'",
  "sinks": "Potential logging of exceptions, dynamic import execution, creation of 'EmojiConverter' object",
  "flows": "fetch_build_eggs -> run -> _post_install_action -> import pyprettifier -> create EmojiConverter",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import during install, broad exception handling writing exception objects directly to a log file, misspelling of 'cryptography' as 'cryptograohy'",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard custom install process with a post-install hook that imports a third-party package dynamically and logs errors. No obfuscated code or hardcoded secrets are present. The dynamic import pattern is unconventional and could be exploited if the package is malicious, but no malicious activity is evident. Exception handling writes exception objects directly to a log file without sanitization, which is a minor concern. The package name misspelling is suspicious but likely a typo. Overall, the code is straightforward and benign, with a low security risk primarily due to the dynamic import pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with a dynamic import that warrants source verification of 'pyprettifier'. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0. The risk score is approximately 0.3 due to the unconventional import pattern, which could be exploited if the package is malicious.",
