  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'cryptograohy' Python package, including custom post-install actions.",
  "sources": "Reads package requirements, executes custom installation commands, imports 'pyprettifier' during post-install.",
  "sinks": "Potential import of 'pyprettifier' during installation, file write operation to '/tmp/.install-error.log'.",
  "flows": "During installation, fetches build eggs and runs post-install actions, including importing 'pyprettifier' and writing errors to a log file.",
  "anomalies": "Writes exception details directly to a log file without sanitization; imports 'pyprettifier' only after installation dependencies are installed, which is normal. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code evident.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the standard setup process to include a custom post-install command that fetches build eggs and executes an additional action. The '_post_install_action' imports 'pyprettifier' and creates an EmojiConverter instance. Error handling captures exceptions and logs them to a temporary file. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated behavior. The import is conditional and occurs after dependencies are installed, which appears standard. The only noteworthy aspect is the error logging, which writes exception text directly, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard setup script with a custom post-install hook. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent. The operations are typical of package setup scripts, with benign post-install actions and error handling.",
