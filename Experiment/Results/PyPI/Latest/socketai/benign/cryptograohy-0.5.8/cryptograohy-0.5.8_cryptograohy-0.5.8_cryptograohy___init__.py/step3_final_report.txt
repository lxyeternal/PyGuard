{
  "purpose": "To serve as a minimal package initializer that imports a function 'greet' from the local 'core' module.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module '.core' during import.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data leaks are present; the code only performs a static import.",
  "flows": "Import statement flows from the local module '.core' to the namespace where 'greet' is used.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple __init__.py file importing 'greet' from '.core'. It does not perform any dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The import is static and local, indicating benign behavior. The code structure is standard for Python packages, and the lack of external dependencies or code execution points to a low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initializer with no malicious intent or security issues. All signals point to a safe, standard import statement. The assigned malware score of 0 and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
