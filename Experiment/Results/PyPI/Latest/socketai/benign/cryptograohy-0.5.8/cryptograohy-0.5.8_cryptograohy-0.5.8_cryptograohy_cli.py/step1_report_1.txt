  "purpose": "Execute a CLI function that imports the 'pyprettifier' library and creates an EmojiConverter object.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'pyprettifier' and instantiation of 'EmojiConverter'.",
  "sinks": "Potential exception handling which outputs to standard output.",
  "flows": "Import 'pyprettifier' -> create 'EmojiConverter' object -> handle exceptions by printing errors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a third-party library 'pyprettifier'. If the import or object creation fails, it catches the exception and prints an error message. The code does not send data over the network, modify system files, or perform any malicious actions. It appears to be a simple CLI setup for utilizing the 'pyprettifier' package. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that imports and instantiates a class from a third-party library, with basic exception handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks in this code fragment.",
