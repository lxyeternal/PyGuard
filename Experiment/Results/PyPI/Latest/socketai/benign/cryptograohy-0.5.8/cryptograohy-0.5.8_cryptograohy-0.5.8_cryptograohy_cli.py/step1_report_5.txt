{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import the 'pyprettifier' library and instantiate an 'EmojiConverter' object, likely for command-line interface (CLI) functionality related to emoji processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'pyprettifier' module during import, and the instantiation of 'EmojiConverter()' as a data source.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs exception messages via print(), which could leak error information but is not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "Input is the import and instantiation of the library; exception handling captures errors; output via print() is the only output sink.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code's simplicity and straightforward import and exception handling do not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are used.",
  "analysis": "The script is a minimal CLI utility that imports a specific library and creates an object. The try-except block handles import or instantiation errors gracefully. No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are evident. The code appears to be part of a CLI tool for emoji conversion, relying on a third-party library. The exception message is printed directly, which is typical for debugging or CLI apps but does not imply malicious behavior. No embedded secrets or unusual code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI script that imports a library and instantiates an object with basic exception handling. There is no evidence of malicious activity, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility component.",
