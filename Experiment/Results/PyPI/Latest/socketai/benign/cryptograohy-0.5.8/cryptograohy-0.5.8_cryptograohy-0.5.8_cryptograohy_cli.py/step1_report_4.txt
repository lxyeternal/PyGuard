{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a command-line interface that attempts to import and instantiate an object from the 'pyprettifier' library, likely for processing or converting emoji or related data.",
  "sources": "The import statement for 'pyprettifier' and the instantiation of 'EmojiConverter' object.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; the code only prints exceptions and does not handle or transmit sensitive data.",
  "flows": "If 'pyprettifier' is successfully imported, an instance of 'EmojiConverter' is created; if an exception occurs, it is printed. No further data flow or transmission is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The 'try-except' block is standard error handling, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a third-party library and creates an instance of a class from that library, catching and printing exceptions if any occur. There are no suspicious code features such as dynamic execution, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It is a simple CLI setup. Since the library 'pyprettifier' is not inherently malicious and no malicious actions are performed, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a basic import and object instantiation with standard exception handling. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are evident. The code is minimal and seems safe.",
