  "purpose": "A simple CLI script that imports the 'pyprettifier' library and creates an 'EmojiConverter' instance, handling exceptions by printing errors.",

  "flows": "Import and instantiate 'EmojiConverter' from 'pyprettifier'; exception handling outputs errors",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and object creation, standard exception handling",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party library, creates an object, and handles exceptions by printing errors. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code patterns are present. The exception handling is broad but benign, merely logging errors. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are detected. The code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior justify a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). The overall assessment indicates benign intent with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks or malware threats. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
