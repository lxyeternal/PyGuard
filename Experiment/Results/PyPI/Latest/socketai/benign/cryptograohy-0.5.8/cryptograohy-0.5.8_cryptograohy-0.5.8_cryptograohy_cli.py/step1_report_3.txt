  "sinks": "No clear sink for untrusted data; printing exceptions is benign, but exception handling could hide issues",
  "flows": "Import pyprettifier -> Instantiate EmojiConverter -> Exception handling",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; exception handling only logs errors without further malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a third-party library 'pyprettifier' and instantiate an object. It catches all exceptions and prints an error message. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious behaviors. The library 'pyprettifier' appears to be for emoji processing, with no indication of malicious intent. The exception handling is broad but only logs errors, which does not suggest malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple import and object creation within a try-except block, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script.",
