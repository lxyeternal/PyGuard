  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the provided code snippet and the associated assessments.\n\n**Summary of the code snippet:**\n- It contains only license comments, a module-level `__all__` declaration, and no executable code, data processing, or external interactions.\n- The code appears to be a stub or header for a utility module, specifying exports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  The code is benign; no issues are present in the snippet. All reports agree on this point.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- **Logical or reasoning errors?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is just a header with licensing info and export declarations, with no executable logic or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Scores and Their Reasonableness:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the absence of any security concern.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports suggest any potential vulnerability or malicious activity, so a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n### Malware Score:\n- The code contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. Malware score should remain 0.\n\n### Assumptions and Claims:\n- The reports do not rely on assumptions about vulnerabilities; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign, standard header with no security risks.**\n\n---\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- Given the uniformity and clarity of the code, there is no indication of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
