  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data flow, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments and an __all__ declaration, with no functions, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the code's static, declarative nature. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present. The high confidence levels reflect certainty about its benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module header with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports and scores are accurate and justified.",
