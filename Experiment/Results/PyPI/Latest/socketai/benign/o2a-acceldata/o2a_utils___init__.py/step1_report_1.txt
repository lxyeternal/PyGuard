  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; potential import statements or usage of external modules not shown.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths evident from the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only license comments and an __all__ declaration, with no executable or dynamic code. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, setting module metadata and export variables. It includes licensing information, which is standard for open-source projects. No data input, processing, or external communication occurs in this fragment. Lack of executable logic means no malicious behavior or suspicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module stub with license information and an __all__ declaration. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation identified. It appears safe.",
