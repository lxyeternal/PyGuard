  "purpose": "Utility functions used by a converter, likely for data processing or format conversion.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; no reading of external input observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions present; no untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from source to sink, as the code contains only comments and module-level declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of actual executable code; only licensing comments and an export list. No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments, licensing information, and a module export declaration. No functions, data handling, input/output, or executable logic is present. It appears to be a minimal placeholder or part of a larger codebase. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are detectable within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign header and export list for utility modules with no malicious intent or security concerns. It contains no executable logic or data handling that could pose a security threat.",
