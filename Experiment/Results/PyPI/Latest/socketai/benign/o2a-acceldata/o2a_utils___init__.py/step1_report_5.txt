  "purpose": "Utilities used by a converter, likely to handle specific tasks related to 'el_utils' and 'xml_utils'.",
  "sources": "No data input sources present in the code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data processing points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows present; code is only defining exports.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of actual functional code; only licensing, copyright, and module exports present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains license comments, copyright notice, and a module-level '__all__' list. There are no executable functions, data handling, or other logic that could introduce security risks. The license and copyright comments are standard and do not pose any threat. The __all__ list indicates module exports but does not imply malicious intent. There are no input sources, data processing, or external calls. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This file consists solely of licensing comments and module export declarations with no functional or executable code. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior based on the provided content.",
