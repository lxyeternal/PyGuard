  "purpose": "Defines directory paths relative to the current file location for project setup and template access.",
  "sources": "The __file__ attribute used with os.path functions to determine current file location.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "Static path calculations based on __file__, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard directory path setup with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard os.path functions to define various directory paths based on the location of the current script. It does not process user input, environment variables, or external data. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or network activity. The code is purely configuration for project directory structure, with consistent and appropriate use of functions. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with confidence scores of 1. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration script for setting directory paths. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
