  "purpose": "Define common directory paths for use across a project, including templates and examples.",
  "sources": "os.path and os module functions that determine file system paths based on the current script location.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only calculates and assigns directory paths.",
  "flows": "Path computations are straightforward and do not involve user input or external untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module, then defines several directory path variables relative to the current file's location. These variables include ROOT_DIR, TPL_PATH, O2A_PROJECT_PATH, EXAMPLES_PATH, and specific subpaths. All operations involve static path concatenations without user input or network interactions, indicating standard directory setup code. No malicious or malicious-looking patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard setup code for managing project directories, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
