  "purpose": "Define common directory paths used across the converter module",
  "sources": "os module functions: os.path.dirname, os.path.abspath, os.path.join",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is used in sensitive operations",
  "flows": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns or suspicious operations; standard path manipulations",
  "analysis": "The code sets directory path variables based on the current file location and predefined subdirectories. It uses standard os.path functions to construct paths, with no user input or external data involved. The code appears to serve configuration purposes without performing any actions that could be malicious or insecure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, solely defining path constants for use elsewhere. No malicious behavior, no suspicious or anomalous code observed.",
