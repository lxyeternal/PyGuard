{
  "purpose": "Defines directory paths for templates, examples, and project components used across a converter utility.",
  "sources": "os module functions such as os.path.dirname, os.path.abspath, os.path.join",
  "sinks": "None; all operations are standard path manipulations",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow; static directory paths are assigned to variables",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs directory path calculations using standard os module functions. It constructs absolute paths based on the script's location, which is typical for configuration files. There are no input streams, user inputs, or network activities. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration setup for directory paths without any malicious behavior or security concerns.",
