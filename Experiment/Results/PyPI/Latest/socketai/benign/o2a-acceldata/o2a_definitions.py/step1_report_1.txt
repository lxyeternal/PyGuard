  "purpose": "Defines directory paths for a converter application, including templates and example paths.",
  "sources": "OS environment variables, particularly __file__ for current file path.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "Path constructions based on current file location, no data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious patterns. Uses standard OS path functions for directory setup.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets directory paths based on the current file location and relative paths, which is typical in configuration scripts. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no external network interactions. The license header is standard and indicates open-source usage. The code appears benign and standard for project setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup script for directory paths with no malicious intent or suspicious activity detected.",
