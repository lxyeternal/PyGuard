  "purpose": "Define common directory paths used across a converter module, facilitating access to templates and example files.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables and __file__ attribute to determine directory paths.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is written or transmitted to external sources or untrusted sinks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior detected; standard path manipulations and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'os' module and defines several directory path variables based on the location of the current file (__file__). These are used for internal referencing of templates and examples. There are no user inputs, environment variables, or external data sources involved. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. It follows standard practices for defining project paths.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple setup script defining internal directory paths with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a benign configuration snippet.",
