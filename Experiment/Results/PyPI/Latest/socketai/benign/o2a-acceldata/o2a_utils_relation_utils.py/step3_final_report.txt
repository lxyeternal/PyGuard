  "purpose": "Create a sequence of relations linking each task to its subsequent task in a chain.",
  "sources": "The input sequence of Task objects passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "The creation of Relation objects that link task IDs, which could be used downstream for workflow management.",
  "flows": "Input Task sequence -> zip(ops, ops[1::]) -> Relation(from_task_id, to_task_id) for each pair.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'chain' that constructs a list of Relation objects linking each task to the next. It uses standard Python constructs without external or dynamic code execution. The logic is correct and simple, with no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The function assumes the Task objects are valid and trusted. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code is a benign utility for task relation management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward utility with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It correctly creates sequential relations between tasks. The existing security and malware scores are appropriate; the code warrants a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (0 or 0.1).",
