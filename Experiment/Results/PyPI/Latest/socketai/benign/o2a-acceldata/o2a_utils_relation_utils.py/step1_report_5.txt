{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for creating relations between tasks in a sequence, specifically building a chain of relations.",
  "sources": "Input is a sequence of Task objects passed to the chain() function.",
  "sinks": "The function generates Relation objects based on task IDs; no external data sinks or untrusted data processing occur.",
  "flows": "Input Task objects are processed to create Relation objects; data flows from Task list to Relation list.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or hidden activities observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing annotations, defines a function to generate relation chains from a sequence of Task objects, and uses list comprehension to create Relation instances linking each task to the next. The logic is straightforward and well-documented, with no external data access, network activity, or code execution features. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for creating task relation chains with no malicious intent. It functions solely to produce a list of Relation objects based on provided tasks.",
