  "purpose": "Utility functions to generate relation chains between tasks in a workflow or pipeline.",
  "sources": "Input: Sequence of Task objects passed to the chain() function.",
  "sinks": "The function constructs Relation objects from Task attributes; no external untrusted data handling is present.",
  "flows": "Input Task sequence -> Creates Relation objects from task IDs -> Returns list of relations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward and uses standard typing and data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports only standard and project-specific modules. It defines a single function, chain(), which constructs a list of Relation objects based on adjacent tasks in a sequence. The function uses zip to pair each task with its successor, creating relations from their task IDs. No external data is read, no network operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious constructs are present. The logic is simple and intended for workflow management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for building task relations within a larger project. It contains no malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
