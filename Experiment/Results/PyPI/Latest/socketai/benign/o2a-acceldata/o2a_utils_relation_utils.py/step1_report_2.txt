{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for managing relations between tasks, specifically building a chain of relations from a sequence of tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the sequence of Task objects passed to the 'chain' function.",
  "sinks": "Creates Relation objects based on task IDs; no untrusted data processing or external output involved.",
  "flows": "Input sequence of Task objects flows into list comprehension which generates Relation objects using task_id attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. No external data sources or sinks are used.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward function that constructs a list of Relation objects to connect a sequence of Tasks. It imports standard typing and project-specific modules. The function uses list comprehension and zip to create sequential relations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code. No external or untrusted inputs are processed in a harmful way. No code injection, network activity, or suspicious operations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for task relation management. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be standard, well-structured, and safe.",
