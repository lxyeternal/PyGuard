  "purpose": "Utility functions for creating relations between tasks in a sequence.",
  "sources": "Input sequence of Task objects passed to the chain() function.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the function only creates and returns a list of Relation objects based on task IDs.",
  "flows": "The code takes a sequence of Task objects and produces a list of Relation objects linking consecutive tasks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets observed. No dynamic code execution or external data access is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type hints, defines a function to create relations between sequential tasks, and uses list comprehension and zip for linking tasks. All operations are straightforward and rely on provided data structures without any data manipulation, external calls, or risky operations. No obfuscated or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for generating task relations. No malicious intent, no security risks, and no suspicious anomalies are present.",
