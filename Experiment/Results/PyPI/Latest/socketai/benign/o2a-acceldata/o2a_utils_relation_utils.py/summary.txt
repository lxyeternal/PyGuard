  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward utility with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It correctly creates sequential relations between tasks. The existing security and malware scores are appropriate; the code warrants a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (0 or 0.1)."
