  "purpose": "Utility functions for creating relations between tasks in a task chain.",
  "sources": "Input: sequence of Task objects passed to the chain() function.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external effects; no system calls, network operations, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Input sequence of Task objects flows into the list comprehension, generating Relation objects based on task IDs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual logic. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to generate a list of Relation objects linking consecutive tasks. It imports standard type annotations and custom classes. The function uses zip to pair each task with the next, creating Relation objects for each pair. No external data input, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns. The only data manipulation is within the context of task linking, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for establishing task relations with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and unrelated to supply chain attacks or malware.",
