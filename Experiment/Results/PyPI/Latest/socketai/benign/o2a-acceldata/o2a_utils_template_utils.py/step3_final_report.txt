  "purpose": "Utility for rendering Jinja2 templates with caching and custom filters.",
  "sources": "Template files loaded from TPL_PATH, data passed to render_template function.",
  "sinks": "Rendered template content, which could execute code if templates are malicious.",
  "flows": "Input data and template name flow into render_template, which retrieves and renders cached templates.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and uses standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Jinja2 environment with strict undefined variables, caches templates after first load, and applies custom filters. It does not perform network activity or handle sensitive data directly. Risks depend on external template contents; the code itself is safe and standard. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard template rendering utility with minimal inherent security risk. External templates could pose risks if malicious, but the code itself is safe.",
