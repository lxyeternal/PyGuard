  "purpose": "Utility module for rendering Jinja templates with custom filters and caching.",
  "sources": "TPL_PATH for template files, arguments passed to render_template function, potential template parameters.",
  "sinks": "Rendered content potentially including untrusted template variables, which could be used for injection if template data is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Template files are loaded from filesystem; render_template uses cached templates and fills in with provided arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; use of third-party libraries (jinja2) is standard for templating. No dynamic code execution, no data leakage, and no network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for template rendering using jinja2. It sets up a template environment with strict undefined variables to prevent silent errors. It caches templates for efficiency. Custom filters 'to_var' and 'to_python' are added, sourced from utils modules. The render_template function loads templates from filesystem, caches them, and renders with provided arguments. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. The code does not execute or evaluate untrusted data beyond template rendering, which could be a vector if input is untrusted, but this is standard for templating systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard template rendering utility with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It is safe assuming the template files and input data are from trusted sources. No malware or security risks identified.",
