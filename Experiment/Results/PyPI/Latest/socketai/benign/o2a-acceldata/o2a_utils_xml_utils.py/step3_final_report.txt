  "sinks": "el_parser.translate (used for EL expression translation)",
  "flows": "XML node retrieval functions call el_parser.translate on node text, potentially evaluating EL expressions",
  "anomalies": "Use of el_parser.translate without validation; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard XML utility functions with exception handling for node retrieval. The only external dependency is el_parser.translate, which may evaluate EL expressions. The code itself is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The primary security concern is whether el_parser.translate evaluates EL expressions securely; if it executes untrusted code, this could be a vector for code injection. The code does not perform network, file, or system modifications. Given the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior, the overall risk is low but depends on the implementation of el_parser.translate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of XML utilities with a potential moderate security risk stemming from the external EL translation function. No malware or obfuscation is present. The main concern is the safety of el_parser.translate; if it evaluates EL expressions securely, the code is safe. If not, it could be exploited when processing untrusted XML data.",
