  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling EL expressions, properties, URL normalization, and string escaping in data processing pipelines.",
  "sources": "File input for properties in 'extract_evaluate_properties'; EL expressions via 'el_parser.translate'; environment variables or properties via 'props'; URL strings passed to 'normalize_path' and 'replace_url_el'; string inputs in 'escape_string_with_python_escapes'.",
  "sinks": "Potential URL or property string manipulation that could lead to injection if inputs are malicious; environment rendering with Jinja2 which may evaluate untrusted templates; string escaping which could be exploited if misused.",
  "flows": "Input from properties files or strings → EL translation via 'el_parser.translate' → Jinja2 rendering for property values → URL parsing and validation in 'normalize_path' and 'replace_url_el' → String escaping in 'escape_string_with_python_escapes'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'jinja2' templates with 'StrictUndefined' which could potentially evaluate untrusted templates if not properly sanitized. No explicit input sanitization or validation on 'el_parser.translate' output. Logging warnings on missing files, but no sensitive data handling or security controls are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code reads properties from files, processes EL expressions with 'el_parser.translate', and uses Jinja2 for template rendering. URL functions parse and validate URL schemes, raising exceptions if schemes are invalid. String escaping utilizes codecs.escape_encode to prepare strings for safe inclusion. No evidence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Use of Jinja2 could pose a risk if untrusted templates are rendered, but 'StrictUndefined' limits undefined variables. No network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious actions are present. The functions perform data parsing, transformation, and validation in standard ways, with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions for property and URL processing with standard practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The only potential concern is the handling of template rendering with Jinja2, which should be safe given 'StrictUndefined', but could pose a risk if malicious templates are introduced externally. Overall, the code is benign and aligns with normal data processing tasks.",
