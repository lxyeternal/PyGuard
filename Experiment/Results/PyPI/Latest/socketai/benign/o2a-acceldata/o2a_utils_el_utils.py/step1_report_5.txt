  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling EL expressions, property parsing, URL normalization, and escaping strings in a data processing context.",
  "sources": "Reading from property files, input URLs, and EL expressions within strings.",
  "sinks": "Rendering EL expressions via jinja2, URL parsing, and string escaping.",
  "flows": "Input data (properties, URLs, EL expressions) processed through translation and parsing functions, potentially rendering EL expressions with context variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Use of standard libraries and functions with no suspicious side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs safe parsing, translation, and URL handling with no evidence of malicious intent. Functions like 'strip_el' and 'extract_evaluate_properties' handle string manipulation and property evaluation securely. The use of jinja2 for template rendering is controlled and standard. URL validation enforces scheme restrictions to 'hdfs' and empty, reducing risks of malicious URL schemes. No network operations, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code are present. The escape_string_with_python_escapes function simply escapes strings for safe inclusion in code or commands. Overall, the code demonstrates standard utility functions with appropriate safeguards and no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This module contains safe utility functions for processing EL expressions, properties, and URLs. It does not include any malicious or suspicious code behaviors. The overall security risk is very low.",
