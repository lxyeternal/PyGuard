  "purpose": "Utility functions for processing and parsing EL expressions, properties files, and URLs in a data pipeline context.",
  "sources": "Input data includes properties files, EL expressions, URL strings, and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include rendering of EL expressions using Jinja2, URL parsing, and environment variable expansion.",
  "flows": "EL translation -> URL parsing or property evaluation -> environment variable resolution -> output generation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code relies on external EL parser and Jinja2 rendering; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly performs parsing, translation, and validation of properties, URLs, and EL expressions using standard libraries and Jinja2. It uses safe practices like environment-defined variables, explicit URL schema validation, and safe string handling. No network connections, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. The EL expressions are rendered within the context of provided properties, which is typical for templating and does not indicate malicious intent. The functions are designed for data pipeline configuration and do not include any suspicious or malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for parsing and processing EL expressions, properties, and URLs. There are no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior, such as network exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or data theft. The implementation uses standard libraries and best practices, with no suspicious code or anomalies detected.",
