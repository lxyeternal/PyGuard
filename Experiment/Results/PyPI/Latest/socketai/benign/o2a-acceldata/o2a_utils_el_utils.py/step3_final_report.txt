  "purpose": "Utility functions for EL expression handling, property parsing, URL validation, and string escaping within data processing workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads from property files, input URLs, and EL expressions; uses environment variables and external libraries for parsing and rendering.",
  "sinks": "URL parsing and validation, EL expression rendering, string escaping, and property dictionary updates.",
  "flows": "Input data (property files, URLs, EL expressions) is read, processed through translation and validation functions, and outputs sanitized URLs, property dictionaries, or escaped strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries (re, os, codecs, jinja2) for safe string manipulation, URL parsing, and template rendering with 'StrictUndefined' to mitigate injection risks. Property files are parsed with validation, and EL expressions are translated with controlled rendering. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation present. The potential security concern is untrusted template rendering, but safeguards are in place. Overall, the code functions as a benign utility module with minimal security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility module for EL processing, URL validation, and string escaping. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage are evident. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified, primarily due to template rendering considerations in untrusted environments.",
