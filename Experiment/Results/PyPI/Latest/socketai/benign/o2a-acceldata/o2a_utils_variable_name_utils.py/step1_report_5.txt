  "purpose": "Utility function to convert arbitrary string names into valid Python variable identifiers.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'name' of convert_to_python_variable function.",
  "sinks": "Return value of convert_to_python_variable function, used as a variable name in Python code.",
  "flows": "Input string 'name' -> character replacements and regex substitutions -> sanitized variable name returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs straightforward string sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 're' module for regular expression operations. It defines a single function that sanitizes a string to be a valid Python variable name by replacing hyphens with underscores, replacing invalid characters with underscores, and removing leading characters until a valid starting character (letter or underscore) is found. The logic is simple, deterministic, and does not include any obfuscation, external data fetching, or malicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility function for string sanitization with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
