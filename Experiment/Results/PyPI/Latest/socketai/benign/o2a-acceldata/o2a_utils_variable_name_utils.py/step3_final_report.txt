{
  "purpose": "Sanitizes input strings into valid Python variable names by replacing hyphens with underscores, replacing invalid characters with underscores, and removing leading characters until a valid start (letter or underscore) is found.",
  "sources": "Input string parameter 'name' processed through string replacement and regex substitutions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external effects; the function outputs a sanitized string.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' -> replace hyphens -> replace invalid characters -> remove leading invalid characters -> output sanitized name.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward string sanitization with standard regex and string methods.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility function that performs string sanitization for variable names. It replaces hyphens with underscores, replaces all non-alphanumeric and non-underscore characters with underscores, and strips leading characters until a valid starting character (letter or underscore) is found. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling. The logic is clear, deterministic, and uses standard Python features. No secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is benign, and it does not perform any network, file, or cryptographic operations. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified and appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility function for string sanitization with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
