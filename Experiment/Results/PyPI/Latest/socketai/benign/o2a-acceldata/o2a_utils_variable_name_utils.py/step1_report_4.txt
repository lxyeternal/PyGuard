  "purpose": "Utility for converting arbitrary strings into valid Python variable names",
  "sources": "Input string parameter 'name' in the function 'convert_to_python_variable'",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing the converted variable name",
  "flows": "Input 'name' -> processing steps with regex replacements -> return processed name",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No dynamic code execution or external network interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs string sanitization to ensure the input string conforms to Python variable naming rules. It replaces hyphens with underscores, replaces invalid characters with underscores, and removes leading characters until a valid starting character (letter or underscore) is found. The operations are purely string manipulations using regex and string methods. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code is a simple utility function for string normalization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for sanitizing variable names, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
