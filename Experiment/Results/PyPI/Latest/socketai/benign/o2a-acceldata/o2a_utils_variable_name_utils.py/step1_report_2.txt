  "purpose": "Utility function to convert arbitrary string names into valid Python variable identifiers.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'name' which is a string provided to the function convert_to_python_variable.",
  "sinks": "The processed string returned as a valid Python variable name; no external or untrusted sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' -> processing steps (replacements and regex substitutions) -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs standard string processing without any suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 're' module for regex operations and defines a function to sanitize a string into a valid Python variable name. It replaces hyphens with underscores, replaces invalid characters with underscores, and strips leading characters until a valid starting character (letter or underscore) is found. All steps are standard string sanitization procedures for variable names. No data leaks, code injections, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and does not perform any network operations, access environment variables, or execute external commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for sanitizing strings into valid Python identifiers. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
