  "purpose": "Utility to convert arbitrary string names into valid Python variable identifiers",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'name' of the function convert_to_python_variable",
  "sinks": "The returned string which is used as a variable name in Python code",
  "flows": "Input 'name' -> String replacement operations -> Return of sanitized variable name",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code performs straightforward string sanitization without any hidden or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 're' module for regex operations. It defines a function to sanitize input strings into valid Python variable names by replacing hyphens and invalid characters, and removing leading characters until a letter or underscore is found. The operations are simple, deterministic, and intended for string normalization. There are no signs of malicious logic, external data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or cryptographic activities. It appears to be a benign utility function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for sanitizing variable names. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
