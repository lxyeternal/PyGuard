  "purpose": "Utility function to convert arbitrary strings into valid Python variable names.",
  "sources": "Input string parameter 'name' passed to 'convert_to_python_variable' function.",
  "sinks": "The returned variable name; no untrusted data outputs or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' flows into string replacements and regex substitutions, then produces a sanitized variable name.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard string sanitization: replacing hyphens with underscores, replacing non-alphanumeric characters with underscores, and removing leading characters until a valid identifier start. The functions used are regular expressions and string methods, common in input sanitization. No external network or file operations, no obfuscated code, and no data leakage mechanisms are present. The purpose is clear, and code is straightforward with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility function for normalizing variable names. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
