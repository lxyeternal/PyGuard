  "purpose": "This code processes RSS feed entries by summarizing their content and updating the entries with the summaries, including a watermark.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include entries fetched from MinifluxClient via get_entries() and entry URLs. It reads configuration from AppConfig and constants from WATERMARK and WATERMARK_DETECTOR.",
  "sinks": "Data flows into Markdown processing, logging functions, and updating entries via MinifluxClient's update_entry method.",
  "flows": "Entries are fetched -> filtered for unsummarized -> processed with fetch_and_parse_article -> summarized -> converted to Markdown -> updated back via update_entry.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. Use of external libraries appears standard; no obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical RSS feed content summarizer. It uses well-known libraries and external clients without suspicious patterns. No malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are evident. The process flow involves fetching, filtering, summarizing, converting to markdown, and updating entries, which is consistent with intended functionality. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate summarization and update functions without suspicious activity. It appears safe with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
