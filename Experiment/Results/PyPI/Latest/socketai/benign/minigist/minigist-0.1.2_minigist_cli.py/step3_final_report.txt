  "purpose": "A CLI tool that fetches, summarizes, and updates Miniflux feeds, handling configuration, logging, and notifications.",
  "sources": "Command-line options, environment variables (with prefix MINIGIST), configuration files, exception messages.",
  "sinks": "Logs, notifications (via network), process outputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and environment variables feed into configuration loading and processing; errors propagate to logs and notifications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard error handling with exception messages potentially leaking info but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that loads configuration, sets up logging, initializes notification and processing modules, and handles errors with logs and notifications. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are present. Error messages could leak sensitive info, but this is a common practice. External modules are standard, and the control flow is typical for such tools. No network anomalies or malicious code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and risk score (0.2) are justified. Overall, the supply chain security risk for this dependency is minimal.",
