  "purpose": "This code defines a notifier class that sends notifications using the Apprise library, configured with user-provided URLs.",
  "sources": "User-provided URLs passed during initialization (urls parameter in __init__).",
  "sinks": "The apprise.Apprise().notify() method which sends notifications to configured URLs.",
  "flows": "Initialization: URLs are added to the Apprise object (source) -> Notification method uses the Apprise object to send messages (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors. Use of logging is standard. No hardcoded secrets or credentials present. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a class for notifications. It accepts a list of URLs, adds them to the Apprise notification object, and logs success or failure. The notify method sends messages to the configured URLs, with logging for success or failure, and exception handling for errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Usage appears to be straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a notification system using the Apprise library, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is designed to send notifications based on user-provided URLs without any suspicious or harmful functionality.",
