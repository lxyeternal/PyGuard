  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on supply chain threats, code injection, data leakage, and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, external data, functions, variables, and potential dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variables, system calls, or execution functions like eval/exec.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user inputs to sinks like network or system calls, possibly via dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Potential obfuscation (variable names, code structure), use of eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns indicating obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code shows minimal suspicious patterns; no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are evident. Report 3's mention of eval and obfuscation suggests moderate concern, justified by a higher obfuscation score (0.4) and potential for dynamic code execution. Other reports lack indicators of malicious behavior, with scores reflecting low risk. The overall assessment indicates low malware likelihood, with some suspicion in report 3 due to obfuscation and dynamic execution possibilities. Confidence levels are moderate to high, given the limited code context but no concrete malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign overall, with no definitive malicious behavior detected. Report 3 warrants cautious monitoring due to obfuscation and potential dynamic code execution, but current evidence does not confirm malicious intent. Scores are adjusted to reflect moderate suspicion in report 3, with low risk in others.",
