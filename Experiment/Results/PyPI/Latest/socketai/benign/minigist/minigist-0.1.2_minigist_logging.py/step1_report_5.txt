  "purpose": "Configure logging for an application using the structlog library with specific formatting and level settings.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the log level string parameter and environment variables affecting logging configuration.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs log messages to standard error stream and configured loggers, but does not handle untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "The get_logger function retrieves a logger instance; configure_logging sets up logging levels and formatters; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code appears to be standard logging configuration without hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes logging with a specified level, configures structlog processors for structured logging, and adjusts logger levels. It does not process or execute untrusted data. No dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no credential handling are present. The structure and functions are typical for logging setup, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup for Python applications using structlog. There are no indications of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is straightforward and safe.",
