  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within an application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with no input reading or external data access.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no code that processes untrusted data or causes side effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes only declare exception types with inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class hierarchy for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from Exception. These classes are used for error handling and do not perform any operations such as network access, data processing, or side effects. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for application error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code.",
