  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their conclusions with the code provided.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - No external data input/output, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, no embedded secrets.\n   - The classes are straightforward, serving as error markers.\n\n2. **Logical and Security Assessment:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is purely structural for error handling.\n   - No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are identified.\n   - The absence of data flows, input/output, or external interactions supports this.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (or 1.0), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature.\n     - Obfuscated: 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n     - Malware: 0, consistent with no malicious behavior.\n     - Security Risk: 0, aligning with the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and justified based on the code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n   - The code does not perform any operations beyond class definitions.\n   - The reports are consistent and do not overstate or understate risks.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities that are not supported by the code.\n\n5. **Overall Justification:**\n   - The code is a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions.\n   - No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present.\n   - The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct; no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct; code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct; no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The code is benign, with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores reflect this correctly.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
