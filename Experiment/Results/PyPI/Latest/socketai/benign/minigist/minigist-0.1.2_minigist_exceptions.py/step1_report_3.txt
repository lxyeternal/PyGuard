{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error handling scenarios in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance statements; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward class inheritance for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of custom exceptions for a Python application, likely related to a Miniflux or summarization service. It contains only class definitions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class, with no dynamic code, input/output handling, or suspicious constructs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a harmless part of an error handling framework.",
