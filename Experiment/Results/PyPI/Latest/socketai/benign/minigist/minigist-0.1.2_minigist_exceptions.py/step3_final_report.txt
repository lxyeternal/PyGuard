  "purpose": "Define a hierarchy of custom exception classes for error handling in the application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception and other custom exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, network operations, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; the code only establishes class inheritance structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from Python's Exception class or other custom exceptions. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data sources, or network interactions. The structure is standard for error handling hierarchies. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with high confidence, zero obfuscation, zero malware, and zero security risk. The scores assigned are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present. The code does not perform any operations beyond class definitions, and there are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security concerns. All reports accurately assess its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
