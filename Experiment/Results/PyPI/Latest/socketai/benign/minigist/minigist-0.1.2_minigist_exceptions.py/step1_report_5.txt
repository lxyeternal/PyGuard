  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a larger Python application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance statements; no data input or external sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks; solely class hierarchy setup.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only establishes exception hierarchy.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in and custom error classes. There are no external data sources, no data processing, and no suspicious behaviors such as code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. The code appears to be a standard practice for organizing error handling in a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward and benign setup of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
