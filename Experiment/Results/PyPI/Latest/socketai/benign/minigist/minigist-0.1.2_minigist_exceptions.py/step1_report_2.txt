  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within an application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; these are class declarations for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leak points; just class definitions.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscation, or hidden malicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations inheriting from built-in Exception classes, structured to facilitate specific error handling. There are no dynamic code executions, external inputs, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for application error management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
