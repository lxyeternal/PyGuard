  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and compare them with the original code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The original code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from Exception or other custom exceptions.\n   - No data input/output, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present.\n   - The code is purely structural, serving as error markers.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is harmless, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is straightforward class inheritance for error handling.\n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are apparent in these assessments.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (or 1.0), indicating full confidence.\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - The risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - No justification is needed for higher scores, as the code is benign.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - All reports assign malware score = 0.\n   - This is correct; no malicious activity is evident.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they consistently conclude the code is harmless.\n   - Their reasoning is sound.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — No security risk identified.\n\n### Additional Comments:\nGiven the nature of the code, I agree with the assessments. The code is purely structural for error handling, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign, standard nature of the code.",
