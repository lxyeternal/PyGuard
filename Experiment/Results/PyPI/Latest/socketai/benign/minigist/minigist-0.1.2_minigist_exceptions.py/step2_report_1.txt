  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The code is purely class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from Python's Exception class. There are no data flows, external inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward and free of malicious activity.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n   The reports consistently state that the code is harmless, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent. This assessment aligns with the code's simplicity. There are no logical errors or flawed reasoning apparent here.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Confidence: 1 (or 1.0), indicating high certainty.\n   - Obfuscated: 0, correctly noting no obfuscation.\n   - Malware: 0, indicating no malicious code.\n   - Security risk: 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n   These scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n   Since all reports agree on the benign nature, no higher risk scores are justified. The code does not perform any network operations, data handling, or contain any suspicious constructs.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is zero across all reports, which is correct. There is no indication of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports avoid assumptions, correctly stating that the code is just class definitions for error handling.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or suspicious elements. The high confidence scores are justified, and the absence of obfuscation or malware is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the collective analysis and the code's simplicity.",
