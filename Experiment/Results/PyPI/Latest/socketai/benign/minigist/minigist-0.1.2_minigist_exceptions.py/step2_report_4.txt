  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims against the code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code is solely a set of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from `Exception` or other custom exceptions. There are no external data sources, input/output operations, dynamic code execution, or other behaviors that could introduce security issues. All reports correctly identify the code as purely structural, with no malicious intent.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is straightforward, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. They correctly interpret the purpose as defining exception hierarchies. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a confidence of 1 (or 1.0), and scores for obfuscated, malware, and security risk are all 0. This aligns well with the analysis that the code is benign. No adjustments seem necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports conclude no malicious or security risks are present, the risk scores of 0 are justified. The code does not perform any operations that could cause harm or security vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior. The code does not contain obfuscated code, hidden payloads, or malicious logic.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports are cautious and accurate, emphasizing that the code is harmless and purely structural. No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is consistent with the code.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. The high confidence and zero malware/security risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0.0\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns.**",
