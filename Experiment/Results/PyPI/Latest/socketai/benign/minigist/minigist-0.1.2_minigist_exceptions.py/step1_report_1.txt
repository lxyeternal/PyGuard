  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points, especially no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways, as these are just class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of class declarations inheriting from Exception, with no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for managing different error conditions. Each class inherits from a parent exception, creating a structured way to handle errors. There are no external data sources, no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior present. The classes are straightforward and serve as error markers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural for exception handling, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not contain any malware or security vulnerabilities.",
