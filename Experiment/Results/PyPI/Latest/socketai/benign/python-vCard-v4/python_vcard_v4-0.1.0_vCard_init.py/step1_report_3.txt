  "purpose": "This code defines the module's interface for a vCard 4.0 parser and generator, including importing specific classes and variables for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports from a relative module '.vcard', which likely contains the implementation details.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data handling points that process untrusted input directly in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this snippet as it mainly handles imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and variables from a local module, defines an __all__ list for exported symbols, and includes a version string. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. It appears to be standard module boilerplate setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module entry point that sets up the public API for a vCard parser and generator. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
