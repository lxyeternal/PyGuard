{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer that imports specific classes and variables from a local module '.vcard' and exposes them via __all__, also defining a version string.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module '.vcard' during import statements.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "The source is the import from '.vcard', which is then exposed via __all__ without further data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, standard boilerplate for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py setup that imports and exposes classes and variables from a local module. It contains no data handling, external communication, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of security concerns. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
