  "purpose": "This code provides a module interface for parsing and generating vCard 4.0 data according to RFC6350.",
  "sources": "The code imports components from a local module .vcard, which likely contains the core functionality.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or external outputs are shown.",
  "flows": "The code imports and exposes classes and variables from the internal .vcard module; no data flow from untrusted sources is present here.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard for a Python package interface.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a package's __init__.py file, importing essential classes and version info from a local module. It acts as an entry point for users. No input handling, data processing, or external communication occurs within this snippet. It appears to be standard packaging code without malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package interface setup with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It solely exposes certain classes and variables from an internal module, with no malicious logic detected.",
