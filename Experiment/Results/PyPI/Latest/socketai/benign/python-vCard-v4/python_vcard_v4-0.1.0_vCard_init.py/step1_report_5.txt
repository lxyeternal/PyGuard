{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point for a vCard parser and generator library, exporting key classes and variables.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'Contact', 'VCardError', 'ValidationError', and '__version__' from a local module '.vcard'. No external data sources or user inputs are directly read here.",
  "sinks": "No sink operations such as network connections, file writes, or evaluation of untrusted data are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports specific components from a local module and exposes them via __all__, with no data flow beyond the import-export statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The version string is static, and the import paths are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, mainly exporting symbols for a library. It does not perform any processing, input handling, or untrusted data operations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module initializer for a vCard library, with no malicious intent or security concerns. It simply exports certain classes and variables for external use.",
