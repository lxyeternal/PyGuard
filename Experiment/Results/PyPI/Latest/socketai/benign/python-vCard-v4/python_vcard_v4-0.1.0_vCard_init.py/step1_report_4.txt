{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python module that imports classes and variables related to vCard parsing and generation, and exposes them for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module metadata and imports from a local package (.vcard).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no untrusted data handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "The code initializes module exports based on internal imports; no data flows or external interactions are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a module initializer, importing specific classes and variables from a local submodule and defining what is exported. There are no functions, data processing, or external data inputs. The import statement uses a relative import, typical for package structure. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security risks are evident in this minimal setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module declaration for a Python package related to vCard processing. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security risks. It is a simple, well-structured import/export setup.",
