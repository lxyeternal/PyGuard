{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Python library for creating and parsing vCard 4.0 contact files, supporting various contact properties including images, dates, and custom fields.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters (e.g., contact details) and vCard strings during parsing.",
  "sinks": "Generated vCard strings during serialization; parsed data stored in object attributes; embedded images encoded in base64.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into object attributes, then into vCard string output; during parsing, vCard strings are unfolded, unescaped, and mapped into object attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected. Image processing uses PIL safely; no network activity or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code adheres to RFC 6350 standards for vCard handling, with clear separation of concerns. Image embedding resizes images locally before encoding, avoiding external network dependencies. Parsing validates presence of required fields like FN, and handles untrusted input with unescaping. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The data flow is straightforward, and the code does not perform any unsafe operations or insecure data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured vCard processing library with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The observed behaviors and code structure indicate a benign implementation suitable for supply chain use. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the detailed analysis.",
