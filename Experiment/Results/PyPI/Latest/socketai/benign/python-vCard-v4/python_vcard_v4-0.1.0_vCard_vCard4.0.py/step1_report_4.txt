  "purpose": "Define a Python module for creating, parsing, and handling vCard contacts, including serialization and deserialization.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function parameters, class attributes, and the vCard string being parsed.",
  "sinks": "Output sinks include generated vCard strings, base64-encoded images, and data stored in object attributes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters or parsed vCard lines through processing functions, and then into serialized vCard output or object attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, nor unusual code behavior; utility functions follow standard patterns. The photo embedding resizes images but does not process untrusted external inputs directly. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. Custom properties and social profiles are handled generically, with no unsafe handling evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on vCard data handling, with functions for escaping/unescaping text, folding/unfolding lines, and serializing/deserializing vCards. It uses standard libraries such as re, base64, and PIL for image processing. The image embedding resizes images and encodes them into base64 for inclusion in vCards, with no apparent malicious intent. Parsing functions handle vCard content and convert to class instances, with validation for required fields. There are no evident code injection vectors, no network activity, nor any handling of untrusted code execution. The overall structure appears straightforward and adheres to common vCard processing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured implementation of vCard serialization and parsing, with standard security practices. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are detected. It operates solely on provided data and files, with no external communication or dangerous code paths. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
