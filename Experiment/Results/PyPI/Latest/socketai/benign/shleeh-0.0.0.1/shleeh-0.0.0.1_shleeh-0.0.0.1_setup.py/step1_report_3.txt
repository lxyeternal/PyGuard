{
  "purpose": "To define and configure a placeholder Python package named 'shleeh' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata such as name, version, author, author_email, description, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the setup configuration is static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors. The package description indicates it's a placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with static metadata fields. All inputs are hardcoded string literals, and there is no dynamic execution or user input handling. No external data fetching or potentially malicious constructs are present. The package appears to be a benign placeholder with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, explicitly marked as a security placeholder. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
