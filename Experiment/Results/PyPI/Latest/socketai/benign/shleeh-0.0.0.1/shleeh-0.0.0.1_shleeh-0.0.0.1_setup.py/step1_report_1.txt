  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging metadata for the Python project named 'shleeh'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string data for package metadata; no external input is processed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or potential data leaks; no external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static metadata setup without data flow or external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "The author and author_email fields are empty, which is unusual but not malicious. No suspicious code, secrets, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package information. It contains no dynamic code, no input processing, and no external data handling. The empty author fields are atypical but not indicative of malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks within this code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign setup script for packaging. No malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscation detected.",
