  "purpose": "To define the package metadata for distribution via setuptools",
  "sources": "The code reads static data for package configuration (name, version, author, description, classifiers)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external data or user input is handled",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static configuration only",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields; no suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration using setuptools, with static, hardcoded metadata. No dynamic code, user input, or external data sources are involved. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The package appears to be a placeholder with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup configuration for a package named 'shleeh'. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security issues.",
