{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded strings for package name, version, author, author_email, description, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted or external data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the data is static and used solely for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; all data appears static, well-formed, and consistent with typical setup.py files.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with static metadata fields. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data are used. The code structure is standard for Python package setup scripts. There is no obfuscated code or suspicious behavior; the email and author fields are empty, which is unusual but not malicious. Overall, this is a straightforward package metadata definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup.py script for packaging, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves only to provide package information.",
