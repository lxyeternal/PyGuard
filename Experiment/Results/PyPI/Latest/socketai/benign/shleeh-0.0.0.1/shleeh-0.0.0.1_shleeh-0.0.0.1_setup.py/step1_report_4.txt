{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the package metadata for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string values for package metadata such as name, version, author, and description.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs, no external data sources, and no sensitive sinks involved.",
  "flows": "The source data (metadata strings) are directly used in the setup() call without transformation or external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; all code consists of static configuration data with no dynamic or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with predefined package metadata. There are no external inputs, no execution of untrusted code, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, and no suspicious patterns. It functions solely as a package configuration script, which is standard for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It merely defines package metadata for distribution.",
