  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python library using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining package metadata, reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sinks; no network or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Static data from variables and file reads; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, reads static metadata and a README file, and calls setup() with package info and dependencies. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard 'setup.py' script with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate; the risk score should be 0 for full accuracy. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
  "confidence": 1,
