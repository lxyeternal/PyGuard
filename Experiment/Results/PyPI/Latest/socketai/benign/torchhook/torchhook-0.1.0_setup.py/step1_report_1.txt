  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'torchhook' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the package metadata, including package dependencies and description, primarily from static strings and a README file.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks for untrusted input; the setup process installs dependencies and package data.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; static configuration and file reading are used.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be standard setup configuration without suspicious or unusual elements.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools to configure package installation. It specifies package details such as name, version, author, description, and dependencies. The only file read is 'README.md', which is a common practice and does not involve user input or untrusted data. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or network activity is present. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are found. The code is typical for Python package setup scripts, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not perform any malicious actions.",
