  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'torchhook' Python library, managing dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, dependencies, and the README file for long description.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "The data flows from static strings and the README file into package configuration, with no untrusted input sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The use of 'open' is standard for reading long descriptions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery. There are no dynamic or unsafe operations. All inputs are static or from trusted sources (local files, constants).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It functions solely to package the project for distribution.",
