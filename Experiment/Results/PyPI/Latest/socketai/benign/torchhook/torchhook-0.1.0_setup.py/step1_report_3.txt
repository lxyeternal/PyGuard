{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'torchhook' Python package, used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, reading 'README.md' for long description, importing 'setuptools' for setup functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or user input; primarily static configuration and file reading.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and package metadata; no data flows from external or untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks: importing 'setuptools', reading 'README.md' for description, defining package info and dependencies. All actions are typical for a package distribution script. No dynamic code execution, no external data processing beyond reading a local file, and no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears normal and free of malicious code. It simply configures the package metadata and dependencies for distribution without any signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
