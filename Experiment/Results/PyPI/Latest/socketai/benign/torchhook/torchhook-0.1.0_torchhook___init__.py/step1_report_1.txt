  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code snippet; no data is processed or sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing 'HookManager' from 'hookmanager', which could be used later in the code, but no flow is shown here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "analysis": "This code only imports a class or function from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious control flows. Without additional context, this appears to be a standard import statement typical in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a simple import statement with no indications of malicious intent. It appears to be a benign part of a larger codebase.",
