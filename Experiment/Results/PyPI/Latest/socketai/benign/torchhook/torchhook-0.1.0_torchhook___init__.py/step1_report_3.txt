  "purpose": "The code imports the HookManager class from a module named hookmanager, likely to manage hooks or callbacks within the application.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .hookmanager, which accesses a local module within the package",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this single line; no data processing or output occurs here",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable in this minimal snippet",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward import statement; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident",
  "analysis": "The snippet consists solely of an import statement, which is standard for modular code organization. It imports HookManager from a local module. Since there are no other code constructs, no data inputs, outputs, or flows are present. No suspicious or malicious behavior can be inferred from this line alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a standard part of a larger codebase.",
