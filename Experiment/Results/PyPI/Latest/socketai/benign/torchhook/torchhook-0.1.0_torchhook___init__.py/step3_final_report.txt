  "purpose": "Importing HookManager from a local module named hookmanager.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this is a static import with no data flow or execution flow beyond module import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in this minimal code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement, typical in Python projects. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The import is from a local module, and there are no external network activities, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flows. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk near zero) are consistent with the benign nature of this code. Confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty that this is a standard, safe import statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign and typical for Python modules. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports and scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted based solely on this import statement.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
