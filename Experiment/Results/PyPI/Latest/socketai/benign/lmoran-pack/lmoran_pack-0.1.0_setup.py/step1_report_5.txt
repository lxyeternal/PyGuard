  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'lmoran_pack'.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata such as name, version, author, email, description, and package list from the script.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "Reads metadata inputs and passes them to the setup() function; no data flows to external systems or resources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be standard package setup using setuptools without obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup, defines package metadata (name, version, author info, description), and specifies package discovery and classifiers. All code follows standard practices for Python packaging. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious imports are present. The code solely serves to facilitate package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It simply specifies package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
