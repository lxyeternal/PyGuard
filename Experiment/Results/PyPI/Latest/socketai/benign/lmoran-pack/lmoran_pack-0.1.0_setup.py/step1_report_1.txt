{
  "purpose": "The code is used to configure and distribute a Python package named 'lmoran_pack' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata such as name, version, author, author_email, description, classifiers, and Python requirements from the script itself.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the script does not execute or process external input or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The package metadata is statically defined and used by the setup() function to create the package distribution; there are no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with static parameters defining package metadata. No dynamic code execution, no user input processing, and no external data handling are present. The code appears standard for Python package distribution and does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only defines package metadata for distribution.",
