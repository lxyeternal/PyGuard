  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata and configuration for a Python package named 'lmoran_pack' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters: name, version, author, author_email, description, classifiers, python_requires",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input processing",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration only",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard static setup script utilizing setuptools, with all parameters hardcoded and no dynamic or external data handling. It contains no obfuscated code, no malicious patterns, and no external inputs. The description string is informal but not suspicious. All signals indicate benign behavior, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect this.",
