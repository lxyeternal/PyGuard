{
  "purpose": "The code implements a numerical continuation method to trace solution curves of a parameter-dependent system of equations, with bifurcation detection and localization.",
  "sources": "Input data includes initial points u0, p0, initial tangent, and functions Gu_v, Gp, G for system evaluation; also, random vectors r and l for bifurcation detection.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could be from external inputs to the functions Gu_v, Gp, G, or from the random number generator; however, no explicit untrusted data handling is present.",
  "flows": "Sources (system functions, initial conditions, random vectors) flow into the continuation loop, where the tangent computation, predictor, corrector, and bifurcation detection occur; bifurcation detection results influence flow into localization (bisection).",
  "anomalies": "Use of random vectors for bifurcation detection appears standard; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. No unusual code constructs or misleading variables are present. The code uses standard libraries and functions without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs numerical continuation with tangent prediction, Newton-based correction, and bifurcation detection via test_fn_bifurcation. It utilizes numpy, scipy, and a local TestFunctions module, with appropriate error handling and adaptive step size control. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, system modification, or hidden behaviors are evident. Random number usage is standard for bifurcation detection. No external data is processed insecurely. The code's structure appears typical for numerical continuation algorithms.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard numerical continuation and bifurcation detection algorithm without evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. No suspicious behavior or malware-like activity is detected.",
