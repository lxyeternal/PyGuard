{
  "purpose": "This code exports the symbol 'pseudoArclengthContinuation' from a local module, serving as a public interface for the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports a symbol from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pseudoArclengthContinuation' and exposes it via __all__, with no data flow beyond this import/export pattern.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward module that imports a symbol from a local module and exposes it via __all__. It contains no dynamic execution, external data handling, or network activity. The pattern is standard for defining a public API in Python modules. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are evident. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all justified as zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign module export statement with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
