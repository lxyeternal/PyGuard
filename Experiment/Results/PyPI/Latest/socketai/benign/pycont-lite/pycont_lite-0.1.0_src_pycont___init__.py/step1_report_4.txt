{
  "purpose": "Expose the module's public interface by importing and exposing a single class or function from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (continuation).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs an import and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with standard import/export pattern; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pseudoArclengthContinuation' from a relative module 'continuation' and exposes it via __all__. This is a common pattern for defining module interfaces. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected; no data processing, input/output handling, or external connections. The code appears straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module export statement with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is standard practice for Python modules.",
