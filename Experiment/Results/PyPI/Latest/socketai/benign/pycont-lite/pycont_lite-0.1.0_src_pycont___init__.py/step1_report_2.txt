{
  "purpose": "Export the 'pseudoArclengthContinuation' class or function from the current module for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pseudoArclengthContinuation' from a relative module '.continuation'. It does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there is no untrusted data handling or potential data leak points.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports an entity from a sibling module and exposes it via the __all__ list for controlled external access. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The lack of complex logic or external data handling indicates a typical module export pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard module export statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be part of a larger package where 'pseudoArclengthContinuation' is implemented. There are no anomalies or risks identified.",
