  "purpose": "The code exports the 'pseudoArclengthContinuation' class or function from a local module for external use.",
  "sources": "The import statement from '.continuation' module, which may read local files or modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks in this snippet; no data leaks or untrusted outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this minimal code snippet; no input/output flows are defined.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific component from a local module and exposes it via __all__, which is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The simplicity and lack of dynamic execution or external network interactions suggest no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears to be a standard, benign module export statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
