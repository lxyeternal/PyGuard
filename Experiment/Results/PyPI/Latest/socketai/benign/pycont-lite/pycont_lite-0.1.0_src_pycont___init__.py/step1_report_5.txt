{
  "purpose": "Exports the 'pseudoArclengthContinuation' function or class from the current module for public use.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .continuation import pseudoArclengthContinuation",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows from untrusted sources or external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks detected; the code only imports and exports a symbol.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for a Python module's __all__ declaration. No suspicious or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific symbol from a sibling module and defines __all__ for export. There are no external inputs, no dynamic execution, or embedded data. The structure is simple and standard for Python packages. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python module export statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. It simply makes 'pseudoArclengthContinuation' available for import from this module.",
