  "purpose": "This code appears to implement a numerical method for solving nonlinear equations and performing branch switching in continuation methods, likely for mathematical or engineering analyses.",
  "sources": "Reads include function arguments (f, Gu_v, Gp, x_s, x_prev), external library functions, and variables within functions such as x_s, u, p.",
  "sinks": "Uses optimization routines (opt.minimize, opt.newton_krylov) which may handle untrusted data, but these are standard numerical methods without malicious intent.",
  "flows": "Input functions are called with data from variables like x_s, u, p; results from these are used in computations, minimizations, and root-finding; outputs include directions and tangents for branch switching.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or backdoors. The code employs standard scientific libraries and functions. No obfuscated code or malicious logic detected. The function 'print' statements are benign diagnostic outputs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs numerical computations for nullspace, coefficients, and solving polynomial zeros, all using standard scipy.optimize methods. No data leakage or malicious data handling routines are present. No suspicious or malicious code structures are found. The routines are consistent with scientific computation purposes. The code does not contain any backdoors, unauthorized data exfiltration, or malicious control flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific computation script, implementing algorithms for continuation and branch switching. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on standard scientific libraries and techniques, and no malicious signals are evident.",
