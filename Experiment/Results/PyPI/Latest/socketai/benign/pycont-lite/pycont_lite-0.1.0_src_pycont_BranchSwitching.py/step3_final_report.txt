  "purpose": "The code implements numerical bifurcation and continuation analysis routines, including root-finding, nullspace computation, and branch switching, primarily for scientific and mathematical modeling purposes.",
  "sources": "Function arguments, input variables, and standard scientific libraries (numpy, scipy); no external data sources or network interactions.",
  "sinks": "Uses scipy.optimize routines for minimization and root-finding; no data exfiltration, network communication, or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows through numerical routines such as zero crossing detection, constrained minimization, and polynomial root solving, following standard scientific computation patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected. The print statement is benign and likely for debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard numerical methods for bifurcation analysis: zero crossing detection, nullspace approximation via constrained minimization, coefficient calculation via finite differences, polynomial root solving, and branch direction computation. All routines are typical in scientific software. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The use of scipy.optimize routines is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. The code's structure and functions are consistent with legitimate scientific analysis tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of scientific numerical continuation and bifurcation analysis routines. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects the routine nature of the routines used, with no immediate danger.",
