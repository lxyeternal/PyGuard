{
  "purpose": "The code implements a pseudo-arclength continuation method for tracing solution branches and bifurcation points of a parameterized system of equations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments (initial guesses, parameters), and generates paths of solutions through numerical continuation functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses numpy for numerical computations; no direct sinks for untrusted data; no network or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed to generate solution paths and bifurcation points; no data leaks or external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures; no obfuscated code features. The use of random state for tangent computation is standard in numerical algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code performs numerical continuation with functions importing from local modules. It involves gradient approximations and iterative solution procedures. No unusual data handling, code injection, or privacy violations are detected. The logic aligns with standard continuation algorithms. No signs of malware such as network communication, data theft, or destructive actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a numerical continuation method for bifurcation analysis. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
