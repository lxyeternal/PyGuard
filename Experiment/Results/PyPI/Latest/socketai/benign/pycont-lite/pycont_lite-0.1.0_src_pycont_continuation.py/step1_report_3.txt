{
  "purpose": "The code implements a pseudo-arclength continuation method for solving parameter-dependent equations, with functions for computing tangents, performing continuation, and handling bifurcations.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters (initial conditions u0, p0, step sizes, tolerances), gradient functions Gu_v and Gp, and random seed for tangent calculation.",
  "sinks": "Uses the G function which could potentially be untrusted; calls external functions pac.continuation and brs.branchSwitching, which could contain malicious code, but are imported modules. No direct data leaks or network actions observed.",
  "flows": "Generates tangent vectors -> performs continuation steps -> identifies bifurcation points -> possibly switches branches -> recursive continuation. Data flows primarily involve mathematical computations and recursive calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random number generator for initial tangent, but this is standard for such algorithms. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs. No anomalous behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs numerical continuation techniques with standard mathematical operations. It relies on external modules (pac and brs) which are not provided, so their integrity cannot be verified here. The use of lambda functions for gradient approximations is typical. No network activity, system manipulation, or suspicious data handling present. The flow appears to be legitimate mathematical modeling code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a numerical continuation algorithm for bifurcation analysis. No malicious behavior or sabotage evident. External dependencies are modular and standard for scientific computations. No signs of malware or security risks detected.",
