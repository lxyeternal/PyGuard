  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific computation routine for bifurcation analysis with no signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior. Security risk is minimal, and malware score is 0. Obfuscation score is 0. Confidence in these assessments is high (0.9+). External module trustworthiness is a minor consideration but does not alter the benign nature of the code."
