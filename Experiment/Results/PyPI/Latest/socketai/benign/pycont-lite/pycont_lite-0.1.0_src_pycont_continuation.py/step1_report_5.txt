  "purpose": "The code implements a numerical continuation method for solving parameter-dependent equations, including bifurcation analysis and branch switching.",
  "sources": "Inputs include the function G, initial conditions u0, p0, step sizes ds_0, ds_min, ds_max, N, and tolerance. Data is read from function parameters, initial random state, and external functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data flows occur through function G and its derivatives, but no direct data sinks (such as network communication or file I/O) are present.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data flows from input parameters into derivative calculations, numerical continuation functions, and bifurcation detection; then into branch switching. No external data sinks are identified.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a random number generator for initial tangent estimation, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs are observed. The code structure and comments are straightforward. No suspicious or hidden code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs numerical continuation, utilizing external modules for tangent computation and continuation steps. It contains typical structures for such algorithms, including bifurcation detection and branch switching. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or hidden backdoors are present. The use of random initial tangent is standard in numerical algorithms. No external network or file I/O is involved. The code appears clean, well-structured, and purpose-driven without suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of a numerical continuation algorithm for bifurcation analysis. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. It appears safe and functional for its intended scientific purpose.",
