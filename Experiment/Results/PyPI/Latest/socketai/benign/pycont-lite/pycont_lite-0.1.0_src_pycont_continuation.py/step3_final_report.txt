  "purpose": "Implement a numerical continuation method for bifurcation analysis, detecting bifurcation points and performing branch switching.",
  "sources": "Input parameters u0, p0; random tangent vector; external modules 'pac' and 'brs' for core routines.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network activity, or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into continuation functions; tangent computation and branch switching use external modules; results stored in result object.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; use of random number generator is standard; external modules' trustworthiness cannot be verified but are assumed standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard numerical bifurcation analysis routines, relying on external modules for core algorithms. No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. Use of numpy and random for tangent vector initialization is typical. External dependencies are a potential trust point but do not indicate malicious intent. No network, file, or system manipulation code is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific computation routine for bifurcation analysis with no signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior. Security risk is minimal, and malware score is 0. Obfuscation score is 0. Confidence in these assessments is high (0.9+). External module trustworthiness is a minor consideration but does not alter the benign nature of the code.",
