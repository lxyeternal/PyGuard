{
  "purpose": "The code performs numerical continuation methods, specifically pseudo-arclength continuation for solving parameter-dependent equations and detecting bifurcations.",
  "sources": "Inputs include functions G, u0, p0, and various parameters; data is read from function arguments and numpy random state initialization.",
  "sinks": "No sinks found that handle untrusted data; no code writes or executes untrusted inputs or sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Flow from initial data (u0, p0) through gradient computations into continuation steps; no evident malicious flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random number generator for initial tangent vector; the code is standard for continuation algorithms, with no suspicious hardcoded secrets or backdoors. No obfuscated or misleading code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script implements standard numerical continuation procedures with bifurcation detection and branch switching. It uses numpy for mathematical operations, and relies on external modules for core continuation and branch switching algorithms. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or system modifications are present. The code's flow is typical for scientific computing. The random seed generation appears normal, used for initial tangent vector calculation. The overall structure and logic align with known algorithms for path-following and bifurcation analysis.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate numerical analysis tasks related to bifurcation detection. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage, and operates within expected parameters for such scientific algorithms.",
