{
  "purpose": "The code performs numerical continuation to trace solution curves of a function G with respect to parameters, identifying bifurcation points and branching behavior.",
  "sources": "Inputs to functions G(u, p), u0, p0, and random state for tangent initialization.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are evident; no untrusted data outputs or network communications are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (u, p) and parameters flow through the functions G, Gu_v, Gp, and into the continuation routines; bifurcation points are identified and stored.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. Use of np.random.RandomState() is standard, not malicious. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads evident.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up numerical continuation for solution curves, calculates tangent vectors, performs recursive continuation, detects bifurcation points, and executes branch switching. All functions and variables are standard for such numerical analysis. No network, file I/O, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a standard scientific computing implementation with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical numerical continuation implementation without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious external interactions.",
