  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific routine for bifurcation detection with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores in the reports are consistent with this assessment. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated 0, and the security risk very low (~0.1) due to benign print statements, but can be set to 0 for minimal risk."
