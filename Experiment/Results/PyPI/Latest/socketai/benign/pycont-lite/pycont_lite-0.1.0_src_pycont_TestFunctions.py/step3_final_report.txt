  "purpose": "Implement a bifurcation detection routine using regularized Jacobian-vector products and iterative solvers with a fallback to direct matrix inversion.",
  "sources": "Function parameters dF_w, x, l, r, y_prev, and internal variables within test_fn_bifurcation and test_fn_bifurcation_exact.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or file operations; data flows internally between functions.",
  "flows": "Input functions and variables flow into matrix-vector operations, with results used in iterative and direct solvers; no external data transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Explicit construction of the full Jacobian matrix for the direct solve is inefficient but not malicious; no obfuscation or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard numerical bifurcation analysis using regularized Jacobian-vector products, GMRES iterative solver, and fallback to explicit matrix inversion. It contains no external network or file I/O, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns. The fallback to explicit Jacobian construction is computationally costly but typical in scientific routines. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific routine for bifurcation detection with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores in the reports are consistent with this assessment. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated 0, and the security risk very low (~0.1) due to benign print statements, but can be set to 0 for minimal risk.",
