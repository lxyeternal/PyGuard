{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the OrgCrawler class methods related to publishing organizations and roots, designed to verify error handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from pytest, local modules (.type_defs, .orgtreepubsub), and boto3.session.Session()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only instantiates objects, raises exceptions, and sets methods.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of Session object → creation of OrgCrawler instance → method overriding → crawl invocation that triggers error handling",
  "anomalies": "The code modifies methods of OrgCrawler instance dynamically by assignment, but this is typical in testing. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite using pytest to validate error handling in the OrgCrawler class. It imports necessary modules and creates instances of Session and OrgCrawler. It overrides class methods for testing specific failure scenarios, then invokes crawl to check if exceptions are correctly raised. No suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated or malicious logic. Usage of moto is commented, indicating intention to test with mocked AWS services, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard unit testing without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. The code is safe and intended solely for testing error handling in a controlled environment.",
