  "purpose": "Define data models and conversion methods for AWS Organizations entities using boto3 type definitions.",
  "sources": "Imports from boto3 type definitions, class methods converting boto3 dicts to data classes, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or untrusted data outputs; the code primarily processes trusted boto3 API responses.",
  "flows": "Input from boto3 dictionaries flows into data class instances via class methods, with no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Usage of type annotations and class methods appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs data models representing AWS Organizations entities. It uses type annotations, dataclasses, and class methods to convert boto3 API responses into structured Python objects. The logic is straightforward, with no indications of code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior. No network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated code is present. The code relies on external boto3 responses, which are considered trusted data sources. Overall, the implementation appears secure and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe data modeling layer for AWS Organizations entities. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
