  "purpose": "This code defines data models for AWS Organizations resources using Python dataclasses, with conversion methods from boto3 types.",
  "sources": "Data is read from boto3 AWS Organizations type definitions, primarily within 'from_boto3' class methods.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; no data is sent to external systems or untrusted sources within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from boto3 AWS SDK type definitions into Python objects via 'from_boto3' methods, no untrusted user input processed.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. No dynamic code execution or data manipulation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly defines data classes and conversion methods for AWS Organizations resources, utilizing static type hints. It reads data from boto3 SDK types and constructs Python objects. No input validation, network calls, or data storage is performed within these classes. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The code is well-structured, with clear purpose, and does not include any hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard, non-malicious data modeling implementation for AWS Organizations resources. It poses no security threats or supply chain risks based on the provided code. There are no indicators of malware, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior.",
