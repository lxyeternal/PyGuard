  "purpose": "Define data models for AWS Organizations entities and their conversion from boto3 types.",
  "sources": "None (static class definitions and data model conversions).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "None; data models convert boto3 dictionary types to Python data classes but do not process untrusted input streams or execute external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code strictly defines data structures and conversion methods.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and specific boto3 type definitions. It defines data classes for AWS Organizations entities, with conversion class methods to instantiate from boto3 dictionaries. The code includes type annotations and uses Python's dataclasses for clarity. No user input handling, environment variable access, or network interactions are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior observed. The code appears to be standard, well-structured data modeling code with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of data models for AWS Organizations, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network interactions. Overall security risk is minimal.",
