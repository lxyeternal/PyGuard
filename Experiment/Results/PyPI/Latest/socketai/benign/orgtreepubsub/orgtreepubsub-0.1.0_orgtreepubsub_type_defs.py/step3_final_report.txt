  "purpose": "Data modeling for AWS Organizations entities, converting boto3 response dicts into Python data classes.",
  "sources": "boto3 response dictionaries for Account, OrgUnit, PolicyTypeSummary, Root, Organization, Tag",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; data is only converted from trusted boto3 responses into internal data structures.",
  "flows": "boto3 dict responses -> class methods (from_boto3) -> data class instances",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes with conversion methods from boto3 types, with no external input handling, network calls, or command execution. It relies on trusted AWS SDK responses, and no malicious or insecure patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, security risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. Given the absence of active behavior, external data processing, or secrets, the risk scores could be more precisely set to 0, but 0.1 remains a conservative, acceptable estimate. Overall, the code poses no security threat or supply chain risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard data modeling layer for AWS Organizations resources, with no malicious or security concerns. The current report scores are appropriate, though a security risk score of 0 would be more precise than 0.1 in this context.",
