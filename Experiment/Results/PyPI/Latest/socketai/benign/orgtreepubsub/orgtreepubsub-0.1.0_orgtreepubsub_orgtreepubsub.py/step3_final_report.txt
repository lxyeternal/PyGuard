  "purpose": "AWS organization resource crawler emitting signals for each resource type.",
  "sources": "AWS SDK API responses (describe_organization, list_roots, list_organizational_units_for_parent, list_accounts_for_parent, list_tags_for_resource).",
  "sinks": "Signals (on_organization, on_root, on_orgunit, on_account, on_parentage, on_tag) used for downstream processing.",
  "flows": "API responses -> domain objects (Org, Root, OrgUnit, Account, Tag) -> signals dispatched to handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. No external untrusted input sources beyond AWS responses.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard AWS SDK calls with threading and a task queue to perform resource enumeration. Error handling is AWS-specific and appropriate. Signals are internal event dispatchers, which could be misused if handlers are malicious, but within this code, they are benign. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic present. The code's structure and behavior align with typical resource crawlers, with low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate AWS organization resource crawler with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. It employs standard patterns and safe API usage. The overall security posture is very low risk.",
