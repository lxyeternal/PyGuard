  "purpose": "Set up pytest fixtures to mock AWS services for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "pytest imports, moto's mock_organizations and mock_sts functions",
  "sinks": "None present; no data sinks or external connections.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to sink; mock functions are used locally within a fixture.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code follows standard testing patterns and uses well-known libraries appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and moto libraries to create a fixture that mocks AWS services (organizations and STS). The fixture is applied automatically to tests, mocking these services during test execution. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious code behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and intended solely for testing AWS interactions in a controlled environment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard testing setup for mocking AWS services using moto and pytest. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
