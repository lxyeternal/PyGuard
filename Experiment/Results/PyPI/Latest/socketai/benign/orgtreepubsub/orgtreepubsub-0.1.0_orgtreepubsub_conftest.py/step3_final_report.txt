  "purpose": "Define a pytest fixture that mocks AWS Organizations and STS services during testing to facilitate isolated unit tests.",
  "sources": "Imports from pytest and moto; uses mock_organizations() and mock_sts() within context managers.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; the code operates solely within test environment setup.",
  "flows": "The fixture activates mocks during test execution, providing mocked AWS services for any test functions that depend on them.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, standard, and free of suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing and mocking libraries, defines an autouse fixture that applies AWS service mocks via context managers, and yields control for tests. It does not handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or include any malicious or suspicious behavior. The purpose is solely to facilitate isolated testing with mocked AWS services. The code is clear, standard, and safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard testing fixture for mocking AWS services using moto. It poses no security risks, contains no malicious behavior, and is free of obfuscation. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's intent and content.",
