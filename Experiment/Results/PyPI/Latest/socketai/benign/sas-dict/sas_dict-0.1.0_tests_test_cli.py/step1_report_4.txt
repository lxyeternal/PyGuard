{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'sas_dict.cli' module, specifically testing the 'fetch_word_data' and 'main' functions.",
  "sources": "Input data from command-line arguments (sys.argv), mock return values from 'fetch_word_data'.",
  "sinks": "Printing output via 'print', calling 'fetch_word_data' with user-provided input.",
  "flows": "User input ('test', 'invalid') -> 'main' function -> 'fetch_word_data' -> 'print' statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious code patterns. All functions are standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard unit testing practices with mocking for functions and inputs. It tests the behavior of CLI functions with mock data and simulates user input via sys.argv. No indications of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The code solely interacts with mock functions and prints output. There are no dynamic code executions, suspicious network activities, or obfuscated code patterns. The purpose is strictly testing, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of standard unit tests for the CLI module, employing mocking to simulate different scenarios. There is no malicious behavior, no malware, and no security risks identified. The code is safe and intentionally designed for testing purposes.",
