  "purpose": "Unit testing the CLI functions in sas_dict to verify fetch_word_data and main behavior with mocked data.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (command-line arguments), fetch_word_data (function call), built-in print (output display)",
  "sinks": "print function (outputs), fetch_word_data (called with test inputs)",
  "flows": "sys.argv -> main(); fetch_word_data -> main(); fetch_word_data -> print outputs",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded credentials observed. The tests use mocks appropriately and do not execute external code or network requests.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises test functions that mock fetch_word_data and print functions to test CLI behavior. It simulates command-line input and verifies output correctness. The code solely focuses on testing and uses standard mocking techniques without any suspicious or malicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code does not interact with external systems directly beyond standard library mocking, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for testing the CLI functionality with mock data. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears safe and correctly structured for its purpose.",
