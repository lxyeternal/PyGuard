  "purpose": "Unit tests for the sas_dict.cli module, specifically testing fetch_word_data and main functions using mocks.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv, calls fetch_word_data, and prints output.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting definitions or error messages, fetch_word_data function returning data.",
  "flows": "sys.argv → main() → fetch_word_data → print outputs",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of mock patches is standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests that mock external dependencies and command-line inputs. It verifies the behavior of fetch_word_data and main functions by simulating different scenarios. All code uses standard testing practices with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No code injection, data leaks, or insecure operations are evident. The mock setups are typical for testing frameworks and do not introduce vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of unit tests designed for the sas_dict CLI module. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. The use of mocks and patches is appropriate for testing purposes. Overall, it appears safe with no security concerns.",
