  "obfuscated": 0.75,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with low security risks, except for Report 5, which shows significant obfuscation and suspicious patterns. The current scores are appropriate, though a marginal increase in malware suspicion for Report 5 could be considered. No critical issues detected; further dynamic analysis is advised for suspicious patterns."
