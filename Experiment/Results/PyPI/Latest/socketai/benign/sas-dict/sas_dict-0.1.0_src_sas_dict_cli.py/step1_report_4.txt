  "purpose": "Fetch and display definitions of a given word from an external dictionary API.",
  "sources": "Input from command line argument (word), HTTP request to external API (https://api.dictionaryapi.dev), system terminal size detection.",
  "sinks": "Printing output to the console, HTTP response handling, exception handling.",
  "flows": "Command line input -> fetch_word_data() -> HTTP request -> response handling -> print definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None apparent; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external connections beyond legitimate API call. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code accepts a word as input via command line, makes an HTTP GET request to a legitimate public API (dictionaryapi.dev) using httpx.Client(), handles potential errors, and outputs definitions with word wrapping based on terminal size. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious external communications are present. The external API is publicly available and used in a standard manner. No use of hardcoded secrets, no data leaks, no code injection points, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a straightforward dictionary lookup utility without malicious intent. It securely fetches data from a reputable external API, handles exceptions appropriately, and outputs the data in a readable format. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
