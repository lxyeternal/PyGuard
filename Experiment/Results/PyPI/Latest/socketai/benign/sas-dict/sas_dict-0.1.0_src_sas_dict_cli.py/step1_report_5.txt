  "purpose": "The script fetches and displays dictionary definitions for a given word by querying an external API.",
  "sources": "Input: command-line argument 'word'. External API request to 'https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/{word}'.",
  "sinks": "API response data, printed to stdout.",
  "flows": "User provides 'word' via command line -> fetch_word_data() makes API call with 'word' -> response data processed -> printed to terminal.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Use of external API appears standard. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unusual data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code parses user input from command line, then fetches data from a reputable public dictionary API. It handles HTTP errors and JSON decode errors gracefully. Terminal size is determined for output formatting but defaults if unavailable. The response data is printed to stdout. No external or internal code suggests malicious intent. No data leaks, no suspicious network activity beyond API call, and no obfuscation or backdoors. The code appears to perform a straightforward dictionary lookup with proper error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dictionary lookup utility with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. It handles inputs and external API responses securely, with appropriate error handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activities identified.",
