  "purpose": "Fetches and displays definitions of a given word from an online dictionary API with formatted output.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command-line arguments; reads terminal size from environment variables or system calls; reads data from an external API via HTTP request.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to the console; potential display of fetched JSON data after API request.",
  "flows": "User inputs a word -> fetch_word_data makes an HTTP GET request to external API -> data is returned and processed -> output is printed to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Uses standard libraries and a well-known API. No unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or misleading variables observed.",
  "analysis": "The script takes a word as input via command-line, then constructs a URL to query an external dictionary API using httpx.Client(). It handles HTTP errors and JSON decoding errors gracefully. The response JSON is parsed to extract meanings and definitions, which are then formatted and displayed with text wrapping based on terminal size. No hardcoded secrets, no system commands, no data exfiltration mechanisms, and no suspicious external connections beyond the legitimate API request. The use of standard libraries and publicly available API indicates normal functionality. The code does not perform any malicious actions or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a benign dictionary lookup tool. It properly handles external API requests and user input, with no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe based on the provided implementation.",
