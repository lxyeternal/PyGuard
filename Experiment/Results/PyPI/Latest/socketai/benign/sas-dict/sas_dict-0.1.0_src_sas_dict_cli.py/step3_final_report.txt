  "purpose": "Fetches definitions for a specified English word from an external dictionary API and displays them formatted for terminal output.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command-line argument; makes HTTP GET request to https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/{word}; retrieves JSON response.",
  "sinks": "Outputs definitions to standard output; no untrusted data sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> fetch_word_data() makes API request -> receives JSON data -> main() processes and prints formatted definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected. Error handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that queries a reputable public API for word definitions and displays them with proper formatting. It uses standard libraries and handles errors appropriately. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise are present. External API dependency is minimal and reputable, posing negligible security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, well-structured, and performs a simple, intended function. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. Security risk and malware scores should be set to 0, with a very low risk score reflecting external dependency.",
