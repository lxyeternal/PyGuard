  "purpose": "Fetches and displays dictionary definitions for a given word using an external API.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line argument; API request URL based on input.",
  "sinks": "The API request URL constructed with user input; output to stdout.",
  "flows": "User input -> URL formation -> API request -> JSON response -> console output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected; standard API usage.",
  "analysis": "The script takes a word as input, constructs a URL to fetch data from an external dictionary API, and displays formatted definitions in the terminal. It uses the 'httpx' library for HTTP requests and handles exceptions properly. No hardcoded credentials or malicious commands are present. The code does not execute untrusted code or send data elsewhere beyond the intended API call. It appropriately handles terminal size for display formatting. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dictionary lookup script utilizing a public API. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured utility.",
