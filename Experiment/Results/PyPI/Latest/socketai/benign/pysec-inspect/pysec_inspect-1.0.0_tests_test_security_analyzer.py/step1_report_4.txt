  "purpose": "Unit testing the SecurityAnalyzer class for detecting security issues in Python code.",
  "sources": "File I/O operations (creating and writing to a temporary Python script), reading code from the test file.",
  "sinks": "analyzer.analyze_file() processes the test code to identify security issues; potential data leaks are not directly involved, but the code analysis pipeline could identify vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The test code written to a file is read by analyze_file(), which inspects for security issues; no untrusted input flows into the code being analyzed, only static code analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is standard unit test code, creating a temporary file with test Python code including known security issues for analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a unit test environment to analyze a Python script containing deliberate security issues such as unsafe eval usage, os.system calls, SQL injection, and plaintext passwords. It writes this code to a temporary file, then uses the SecurityAnalyzer to identify issues. The test code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious logic embedded. The only potential concern is that the test code itself includes problematic patterns for security analysis, but this is intentional for testing purposes. The testing code is standard, and there are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code interacts solely with the filesystem in a controlled, temporary manner. No external untrusted inputs are fed into the code under test. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. Overall, the code appears safe and is designed to validate the security analysis tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit testing setup for a security analysis tool, creating test cases with known security issues for detection. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The code is well-structured and purposefully designed for testing security analysis capabilities. Confidence is high that this code is benign and intended for testing security scanner functionality.",
