{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test suite that creates a temporary Python script containing known security issues (eval, os.system, SQL injection, plaintext passwords) to test the detection capabilities of a security analyzer.",
  "sources": "The test code reads input from the test script file created in a temporary directory.",
  "sinks": "The security analyzer processes the test script; potential issues are detected during analysis, not during execution.",
  "flows": "The source is the test script file; the analyzer scans the code for insecure patterns, which are identified as issues.",
  "anomalies": "The test code intentionally includes insecure code snippets for testing purposes; no anomalies or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign test suite designed to evaluate security detection; it contains known insecure patterns but no malicious or obfuscated code. The analysis correctly identifies these patterns as part of a controlled testing environment. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It contains intentionally insecure snippets for testing detection capabilities. The security risk is minimal and justified. The scores and reasoning are consistent and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
