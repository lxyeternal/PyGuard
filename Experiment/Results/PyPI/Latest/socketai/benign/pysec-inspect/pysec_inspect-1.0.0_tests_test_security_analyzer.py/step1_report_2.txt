  "purpose": "Unit tests for the SecurityAnalyzer class to detect security issues in Python code.",
  "sources": "Code reads files (test_code), imports modules (os, tempfile, unittest), and creates test data in memory.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include methods that could execute untrusted code, such as eval() and os.system().",
  "flows": "Input data (test_code string) is written to a file, then analyzed by the SecurityAnalyzer, which scans for insecure patterns like eval and os.system usage, SQL injection, and plaintext passwords.",
  "anomalies": "The code intentionally includes insecure code snippets for testing purposes; no obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious hidden behavior detected. No suspicious network or system actions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test suite for analyzing security issues in a sample Python script that contains known insecure patterns such as eval(), os.system(), SQL injection, and plaintext passwords. It writes these snippets into a temporary file and uses a SecurityAnalyzer to detect issues. The test code is explicitly designed to simulate common security vulnerabilities for testing. There are no signs of malicious intent beyond testing scenario setup. The code structure and content are straightforward and aligned with testing purposes. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or harmful behavior is found. The only potentially dangerous code segments are used for security testing and are not malicious in themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of unit tests with intentionally insecure code snippets for testing a security analyzer. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are present. The code is legitimate test code designed to validate security scanning functionality.",
