{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Config class in the pysec_inspect.config module, verifying configuration loading, rule retrieval, ignore patterns, and rule enabling logic.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration data from a temporary YAML file; no external or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no sensitive data output, network operations, or file manipulations other than reading/writing the temporary config file.",
  "flows": "Configuration data is loaded from a file (source), processed in memory, and used for assertions in tests; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for unit testing; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of temporary files is safe; no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a test suite for the Config class, creating a temporary YAML configuration file in setUp(), then loading and verifying configuration values through various test methods. No external inputs or network interactions are present. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is observed. All file operations are controlled and only involve benign temporary files. The code adheres to standard testing practices without suspicious constructs or obfuscated code. Overall, the code is safe and free from malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard unit testing script for configuration management, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security threats. It performs in-memory configuration validation without external or untrusted data sources, indicating a low security risk.",
