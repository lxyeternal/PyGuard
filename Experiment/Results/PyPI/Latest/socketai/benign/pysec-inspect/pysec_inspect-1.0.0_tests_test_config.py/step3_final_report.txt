{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the Config class, verifying configuration loading, rule retrieval, ignore patterns, and rule enablement.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from a YAML file created during setup, and accesses in-memory data structures.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to potential data leaks or effects; the code only reads and manipulates local files and data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the YAML configuration file into the Config object, then to various method calls such as get_rule, should_ignore_file, and is_rule_enabled.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present; the code uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite for configuration management, involving temporary file creation, configuration loading, and method testing. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code only performs file I/O and in-memory data validation with well-known libraries. No external data sources, network activity, or sensitive data handling are involved. The code structure is clear, and the logic is standard for testing configuration classes. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test suite with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the minimal security concern associated with test code.",
