  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Config class, verifying configuration loading, rule retrieval, ignore patterns, and rule enabling logic.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from a YAML file created during setup.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows; only file read/write operations.",
  "flows": "Configuration file is created in setup, then loaded and manipulated in tests.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code operates within expected testing scope.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard unit testing for configuration management, involving temporary file creation, YAML serialization, and object method testing. No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code uses well-known libraries (os, tempfile, unittest, yaml) appropriately and does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical test suite for configuration handling, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It does not perform any insecure operations or data leaks. The code appears safe.",
