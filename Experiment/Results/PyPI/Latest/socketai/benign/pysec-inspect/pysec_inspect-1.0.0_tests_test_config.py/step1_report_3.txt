{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Config class of the pysec_inspect module, testing configuration loading, rule retrieval, ignore patterns, and rule enabling status.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration data from a YAML file created during setup; accessing in-memory data structures within the Config class.",
  "sinks": "None observed that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects; no external outputs or untrusted data processing identified.",
  "flows": "Configuration file is read at instantiation; data accessed for rule retrieval and status checks; no flow of untrusted external input to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors; tests are straightforward and involve standard library functions and data validation.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up temporary configuration files with predefined data, then tests the Config class methods for correctness. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, no credential handling or sensitive data manipulation observed. The code uses standard testing practices with temporary files and does not include malicious or obfuscated constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard unit testing of configuration handling with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and clean, focusing solely on validating the Config class functionality.",
