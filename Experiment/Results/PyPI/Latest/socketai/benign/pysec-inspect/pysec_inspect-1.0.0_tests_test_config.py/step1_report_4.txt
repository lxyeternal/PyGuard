  "purpose": "Unit testing for the Config class related to configuration file handling in a cybersecurity tool.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from YAML files, particularly during setup and test loading functions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is written or used insecurely; no sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from configuration YAML files into the Config class, then used within various test methods without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code appears standard for unit tests.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard unit tests using unittest framework to verify the functionality of the Config class, including loading configs, rule retrieval, ignore checks, and rule enablement. It creates temporary files for test configs, reads from them, and performs assertions. No external inputs are processed beyond reading static test data, and no network or system modifications are performed. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of unit tests for configuration handling, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe and typical for test code in Python projects.",
