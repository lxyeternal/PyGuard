{
  "purpose": "Main entry point for the PySecInspect tool, initiating the CLI command interface.",
  "sources": "User executes the script via command line; the script imports the 'main' function from pysec_inspect.interfaces.cli.commands.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'main()' which likely handles CLI interactions and may process untrusted input from users.",
  "flows": "User input → 'main()' function execution → script termination.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward invocation of a CLI main function; no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal bootstrap that imports and calls a main function when executed as a script. It performs no data processing or system modifications itself. The actual behavior depends on the implementation of 'main()', which is external to this snippet. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling in this code fragment. It is a standard pattern for CLI applications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical entry point for a CLI application, with no indications of malicious activity. Its security posture depends on the implementation of 'main()', which is not provided. Based solely on this fragment, the code appears benign.",
