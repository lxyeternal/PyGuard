  "purpose": "Main module for PySecInspect, responsible for launching the CLI interface of the package.",
  "sources": "sys (standard input), pysec_inspect.interfaces.cli.commands (imported main function)",
  "sinks": "sys.exit(main()) - potential exit point after executing main()",
  "flows": "import main -> if __name__ == '__main__' -> sys.exit(main())",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code, no obfuscated code, standard import and execution pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the main command function from the CLI module and executes it if run as the main program. The flow is straightforward: invoke main() and exit with its return code. There are no hidden or suspicious behaviors, no data leaks, or malicious patterns observed. The code appears to be a typical entry point for a CLI application.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard main module setup for a CLI tool with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It functions as intended to start the application.",
