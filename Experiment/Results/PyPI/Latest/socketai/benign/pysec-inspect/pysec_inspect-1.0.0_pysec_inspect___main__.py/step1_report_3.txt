{
  "purpose": "Main module for PySecInspect, used to initiate the command-line interface when the package is run directly.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line execution context (__name__ == '__main__') and imports 'main' from 'pysec_inspect.interfaces.cli.commands'.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'main()' function, which could execute arbitrary code defined therein.",
  "flows": "Execution begins when the script is run directly, leading to the invocation of 'main()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving as an entry point.",
  "analysis": "The script checks if it is executed as the main program, then calls the 'main' function from the CLI commands module. No user input, no data manipulation, and no suspicious code are present. The import is standard for CLI tools. The 'main' function could contain potential risks, but that is outside this module's scope. The code does not handle or process untrusted data directly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard entry point for a command-line application with no apparent malicious intent. It safely delegates execution to the 'main' function of the CLI commands module. No malware or security issues are evident in this snippet.",
