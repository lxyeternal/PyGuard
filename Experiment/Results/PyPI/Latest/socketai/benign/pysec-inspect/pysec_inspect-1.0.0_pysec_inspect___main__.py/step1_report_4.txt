{
  "purpose": "Main entry point for the PySecInspect tool, initiating CLI commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line invocation data via the import of sys and the execution of main().",
  "sinks": "The call to sys.exit(main()) potentially executes the main CLI logic, which could process untrusted input if not handled properly inside main().",
  "flows": "sys.argv data flows into main(), which may process untrusted user input, then sys.exit() terminates the program.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward entry point with standard library usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys for system-level functions and calls the main() function from a CLI commands module. It uses the common Python idiom for script entry point. There is no evidence of malicious code or suspicious behavior in this snippet. The actual security implications depend on the implementation of main(), which is not provided. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious activities are present here.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard application entry point with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It simply invokes the main CLI command handler. Security risks depend on the internal implementation of main().",
