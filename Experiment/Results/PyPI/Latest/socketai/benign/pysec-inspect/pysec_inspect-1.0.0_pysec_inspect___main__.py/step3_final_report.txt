{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the main entry point for a Python CLI application, delegating execution to an external 'main()' function.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import 'pysec_inspect.interfaces.cli.commands' and the '__main__' check to trigger 'main()'.",
  "sinks": "The 'main()' function, invoked via 'sys.exit(main())', is the potential sink where untrusted input could be processed, but this is external to the snippet.",
  "flows": "Input flows from the command line execution, leading to the 'main()' function, which is external; within this code, the flow is straightforward: script execution → call 'main()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical CLI entry point that imports and executes an external 'main()' function when run directly. It does not contain any malicious logic, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'main()', which is outside this snippet. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of this code. The overall assessment confirms no malicious or suspicious behavior is present, and the code is safe as a standard launcher.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The current scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
