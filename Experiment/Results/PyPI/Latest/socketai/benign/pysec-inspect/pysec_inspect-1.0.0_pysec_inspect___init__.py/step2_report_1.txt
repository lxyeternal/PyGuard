  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is merely a comment (in Russian) describing an automated security auditing tool for Python, followed by a version string assignment.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, input/output, or executable logic.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is purely declarative/documentational.\n   - No errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning or summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Assigned to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree that there's no executable code, no data flow, no obfuscation, and no malware, the risk scores are appropriately low.\n   - No justification exists for higher risk scores in this context.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n   - The code contains no embedded malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on direct code analysis, not assumptions. The code is minimal and straightforward.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content and the analysis provided.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk identified.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- Given the code's nature as a simple comment and version declaration, these scores are appropriate.\n- No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, purely documentation, with no malicious or security-sensitive elements. The scores assigned are justified and accurate.",
