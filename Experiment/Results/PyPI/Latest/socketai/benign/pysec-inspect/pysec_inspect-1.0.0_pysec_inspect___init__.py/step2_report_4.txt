  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a comment or documentation snippet with only a version variable assignment.\n- No executable code, data processing, input/output, or external communication is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the content.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which seems reasonable based on the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Consistency:\n\n1. **Presence of issues:**\n   - The code is purely a comment and a version string; no issues are present.\n   - No code execution, data flow, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n   - **Confirmed:** No issues or vulnerabilities exist in this code snippet.\n\n2. **Errors or flaws in reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly interpret the code as benign, documentation, or metadata.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - **Confirmed:** The reasoning is sound.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct, no obfuscation)\n   - **Malware:** 0 (correct, no malware)\n   - **Security risk:** 0 (correct, no security issues)\n   \n   The scores seem reasonable and consistent across all reports.\n\n4. **Risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - All reports assign 0 to malware and security risk, which is appropriate.\n   - No justification needed for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware score justification:**\n   - Since there's no malicious activity, the malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they simply describe the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a minimal, non-executable comment and version string, with no suspicious features, data flow, or malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign and contains no security issues.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
