  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a comment or metadata (version string) with no executable logic.\n- No input/output, data flows, or external interactions are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the content.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of executable or sensitive code.\n\n**Specific issues:**\n- The code snippets are purely declarative, consisting of a comment and a version variable. They do not perform any operations.\n- Since the code is only documentation or metadata, the likelihood of malicious activity is virtually nonexistent.\n- The reports are consistent in their assessment; no modifications are necessary.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as there's no evidence of obfuscation.\n- **Malware:** 0, no malicious activity or indicators.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0, no security-sensitive operations or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Potential for higher scores?**\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature, raising any scores would be unjustified.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, purely descriptive, with no executable logic.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n- No further action or adjustments are needed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the content of the code snippets.",
