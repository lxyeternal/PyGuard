  "purpose": "This code serves as a simple documentation comment indicating the tool's name and purpose, along with a version string.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment and the comment at the top.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or handle any data or untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code is purely declarative with no runtime execution or data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains only a comment and a version variable, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, non-executable comment and version declaration. No input, output, data processing, or external interactions are present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. Given the absence of executable logic or sensitive operations, the risk and malware scores are justified as zero. The code's simplicity and documentation purpose support the conclusion that it poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as documentation with no malicious or security-sensitive elements. The current scores are appropriate and accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
