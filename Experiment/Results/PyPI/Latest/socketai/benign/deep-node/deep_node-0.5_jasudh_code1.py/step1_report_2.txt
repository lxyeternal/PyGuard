{
  "purpose": "The code performs exploratory data analysis and linear regression modeling on a housing dataset to predict prices.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'USA_Housing.csv'; no other external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include plotting functions, printing error metrics, and model predictions, which are all standard for data analysis.",
  "flows": "Reads CSV data -> performs analysis and visualization -> splits data -> trains model -> predicts -> outputs results.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No data leakage or insecure operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a dataset, performs exploratory visualizations, splits data into training and testing sets, fits a linear regression model, makes predictions, and evaluates performance metrics. All operations are typical for a data science workflow, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. No code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data analysis and modeling script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a legitimate analysis pipeline for housing data.",
