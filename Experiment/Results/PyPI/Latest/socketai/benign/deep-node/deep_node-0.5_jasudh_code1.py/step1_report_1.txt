{
  "purpose": "The code performs exploratory data analysis and linear regression modeling on a housing dataset to predict house prices.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'USA_Housing.csv' using pd.read_csv.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or external data exfiltration points; no network communication, no sensitive data handling, and no code execution based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from CSV, analyzed, and used for model training and prediction within the same process. No untrusted data is propagated to insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard data analysis and modeling tasks: loading data, visualizing distributions and correlations, splitting data, training a linear regression model, and evaluating predictions. All steps are typical for data science workflows and do not involve any malicious or suspicious code. No external or untrusted input is processed in a way that could lead to security vulnerabilities or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data analysis and modeling script without any malicious intent. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided code. The code is straightforward and follows standard practices without suspicious patterns.",
