{
  "purpose": "The code performs data analysis and regression modeling on a housing dataset to predict house prices.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'USA_Housing.csv'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data leads to security issues; no data leaks, network connections, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from CSV; model predictions and visualizations are generated but do not involve untrusted data flows leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code uses standard libraries for data analysis and modeling without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a dataset, performs exploratory data analysis, splits data for training and testing, trains a linear regression model, and evaluates the predictions. No input validation, no dynamic code execution, no network connections, and no system modifications are present. All operations are standard data science procedures. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data analysis and modeling script with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard libraries and methods without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
