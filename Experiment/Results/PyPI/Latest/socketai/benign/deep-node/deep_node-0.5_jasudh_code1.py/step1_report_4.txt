  "purpose": "This code performs exploratory data analysis and linear regression modeling on a housing dataset to predict house prices.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from 'USA_Housing.csv'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network communication; no sensitive data output or external connections.",
  "flows": "Data is read from CSV → data used for visualization and modeling → predictions generated and compared with actual values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations observed. No obfuscation present. The code adheres to standard data analysis practices.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a dataset, visualizes data distributions and correlations, performs a train-test split, fits a linear regression model, and evaluates its performance. No suspicious functions or external network activity are present. All operations appear to be typical for a data science pipeline.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data analysis and modeling script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It only processes data locally and visualizes results without external or covert operations.",
