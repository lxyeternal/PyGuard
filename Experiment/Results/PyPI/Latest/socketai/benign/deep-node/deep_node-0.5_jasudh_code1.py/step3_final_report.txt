  "purpose": "The code loads housing data, performs exploratory analysis, trains a linear regression model, and evaluates its performance.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'USA_Housing.csv' using pandas.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network communication; data remains within the process.",
  "flows": "Data flows from CSV input through analysis, modeling, and evaluation steps without external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data science pipeline with standard library usage. It does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted inputs. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The code's operations are typical for data analysis and modeling, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard data analysis and modeling tasks. There is no malware, obfuscation, or security risk detected.",
