{
  "purpose": "The code performs data analysis and modeling on a housing dataset, including visualization, feature selection, train-test splitting, model training, prediction, and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from 'USA_Housing.csv' file.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include plots and printed metrics; no untrusted data is sent over networks or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Data flows from CSV input to variable assignment, then through model training, prediction, and evaluation steps, with visualization and print statements as outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or dynamic code execution. The code uses standard libraries for data analysis and modeling.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a CSV dataset, performs exploratory data analysis with seaborn and matplotlib visualizations, selects features, splits data into training and test sets, trains a linear regression model, makes predictions, and evaluates performance using standard metrics. All operations are typical for a data science pipeline. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The code relies solely on publicly available libraries and standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data analysis and modeling script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The overall security risk score is minimal, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
