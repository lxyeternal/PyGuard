{
  "purpose": "To configure the setup process for packaging and distributing the 'deep_node' Python library.",
  "sources": "The code reads metadata about the package such as name, version, author, description, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "The code flows are limited to reading static metadata and invoking the setup function; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The setup configuration appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup with predefined static metadata. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution are involved. The install_requires list is empty, indicating no external dependencies are installed. The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package without malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard package setup configuration with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted input or contain malicious code elements.",
