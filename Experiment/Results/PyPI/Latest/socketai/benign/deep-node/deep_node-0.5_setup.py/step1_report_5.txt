{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'deep_node' including its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata (name, version, author, description) and package list via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the setup process is standard and does not handle external input or output that could be malicious.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only processes static, predefined configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears straightforward and typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to configure package installation. It imports necessary functions and defines package metadata with no dynamic or external input. The use of find_packages() is standard for discovering sub-packages. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident, nor are there signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard, benign configuration file for packaging a Python library. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
