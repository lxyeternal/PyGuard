  "purpose": "To set up and configure the Python package 'deep_node' for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and dependencies from static strings and functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not handle user input or external data streams.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the setup parameters are static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code uses standard setup procedures with no suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with static parameters defining package metadata. There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. The package appears to be a standard configuration script for packaging a Python library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign and adheres to standard packaging conventions.",
