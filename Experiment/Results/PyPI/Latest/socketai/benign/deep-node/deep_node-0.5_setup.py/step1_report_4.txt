  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'deep_node' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads static package metadata (name, version, author, description, packages, dependencies).",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; static data is used for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, specifies package metadata, and calls setup() with static arguments. No dynamic execution, no untrusted data sources, and no suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It contains no malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks. It is safe and typical for Python projects.",
