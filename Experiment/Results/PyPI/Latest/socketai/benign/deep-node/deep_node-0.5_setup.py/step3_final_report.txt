  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Static metadata strings in setup() parameters, find_packages() for package discovery.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup script with static metadata, no dynamic or external data handling, and no suspicious or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (0), with a slight overestimation in one report (0.1). Given the simplicity and static nature, the overall assessment confirms no security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics. No further action is necessary.",
