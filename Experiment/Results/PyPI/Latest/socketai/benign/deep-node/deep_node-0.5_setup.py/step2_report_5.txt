  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- The code only imports `setup` and `find_packages` from `setuptools` and calls `setup()` with static, hardcoded metadata.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code execution, or untrusted data handling are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The `install_requires` list is empty, indicating no dependencies are fetched or installed dynamically.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The `securityRisk` scores are very low (0 or 0.1), which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The `confidence` scores are 1, indicating high certainty that the code is safe.\n- The `obfuscated` scores are 0, correctly reflecting the straightforward, readable code.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The second report assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1, citing \"no untrusted data sources or sinks\" and \"standard setup procedures.\" This slight non-zero score might be overly cautious but not unreasonable.\n- All other reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which seems more appropriate given the evidence.\n\n**Malware and obfuscated scores:**\n- All reports agree on malware = 0, which is justified.\n- Obfuscated = 0 is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
