{
  "purpose": "The code trains a sentiment analysis model using IMDb dataset, saves the model and tokenizer, and performs sentiment analysis on nodes of a NetworkX graph based on their text attributes.",
  "sources": "Reads IMDb dataset with imdb.load_data(), loads the tokenizer from 'tokenizer.pickle', reads model from 'sentiment_rnn_model.h5', and reads text data from graph node attributes.",
  "sinks": "Saves model and tokenizer to disk, loads model and tokenizer for prediction, writes sentiment labels to graph node attributes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading and preprocessing, through model training, saving, and later loading for inference on graph node texts, with sentiment labels added back to the graph.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No suspicious network activity, cryptomining, or data exfiltration code. No obfuscation, misleading variables, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard machine learning procedures: data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, saving, and inference. It loads datasets from Keras, saves models and tokenizer, then loads these for sentiment analysis on graph nodes. The function 'perform_sentiment_analysis' correctly loads the tokenizer and model, processes node texts, and updates node attributes. The code appears to follow normal ML workflows without unusual code patterns. No code injections, hidden network communications, or suspicious behaviors are present. The only notable aspect is the use of file I/O for model and tokenizer storage, which is typical for such applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard sentiment analysis pipeline with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It responsibly loads and saves models, processes data, and annotates graph nodes. No security risks or malware behaviors are detected.",
