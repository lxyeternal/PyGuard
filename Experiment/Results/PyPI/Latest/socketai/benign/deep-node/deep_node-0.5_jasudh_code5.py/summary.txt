  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard sentiment analysis pipeline with no malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external model and tokenizer files, but within the code, there are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are justified as zero."
