{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to train a sentiment analysis model on IMDB movie reviews, evaluate its performance, save the trained model and tokenizer, and then use the model to perform sentiment analysis on a network graph's nodes containing text data.",
  "sources": "Data sources include IMDB dataset loaded via keras.datasets.imdb.load_data, text attributes from networkx graph nodes, and file inputs for model and tokenizer loading.",
  "sinks": "The code writes the trained model to 'sentiment_rnn_model.h5', saves the tokenizer object to 'tokenizer.pickle', and outputs printed summaries, metrics, and sentiment analysis results. No direct data leakage or untrusted data flow identified.",
  "flows": "IMDB data flows from dataset loading to preprocessing, then to model training, evaluation, and saving. During sentiment analysis, text data from graph nodes is loaded, tokenized, and passed to the model for predictions, then results are annotated back to the graph.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The code follows standard data science workflows with typical function calls and file I/O. No hidden or malicious behaviors apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical sentiment analysis workflow: data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving. It includes a function to load a pre-trained model and tokenizer, apply the model to node texts, and annotate the graph. All file paths are standard and related to model persistence. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors observed. The only potential concern could be if the saved model or tokenizer files are maliciously modified outside of this code, but within this script, all operations are benign and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard sentiment analysis pipeline with model training, evaluation, and application on graph data. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected within this code. The overall design is consistent with legitimate machine learning workflows.",
