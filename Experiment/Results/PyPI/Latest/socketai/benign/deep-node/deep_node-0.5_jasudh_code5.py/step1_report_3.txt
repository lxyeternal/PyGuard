{
  "purpose": "The code loads a pre-trained sentiment analysis model, trains it on the IMDb dataset, saves the model and tokenizer, and performs sentiment analysis on nodes of a network graph based on node texts.",
  "sources": "Data sources include IMDb dataset for training (imdb.load_data), saved model ('sentiment_rnn_model.h5'), saved tokenizer ('tokenizer.pickle'), and graph node 'text' attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage occurs if untrusted text data is directly used without validation, and the model predictions are added as node attributes; however, no external untrusted input flows into system-executed code paths.",
  "flows": "Node texts are extracted -> tokenized and padded -> input into loaded model -> predictions -> sentiment labels assigned back to nodes.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for NLP workflows. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors detected. The perform_sentiment_analysis function dynamically loads models and applies predictions, but no suspicious activities are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical NLP sentiment analysis pipeline. It loads datasets, trains a neural network, saves the trained model and tokenizer, and uses them to predict sentiments of texts attached to graph nodes. The saved files are standard, and the code does not include any network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation routines. The perform_sentiment_analysis function dynamically loads models and applies predictions to a graph, which is legitimate usage. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code structure is clear and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard NLP sentiment analysis pipeline with graph integration, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It is safe for use, assuming the source files are from a trusted origin.",
