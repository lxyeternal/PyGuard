  "purpose": "Perform sentiment analysis on graph node texts using a pre-trained RNN model, annotating nodes with sentiment labels.",
  "sources": "Graph node 'text' attributes, model file ('sentiment_rnn_model.h5'), tokenizer file ('tokenizer.pickle')",
  "sinks": "Model prediction outputs, node attribute updates",
  "flows": "Text data extracted from nodes -> tokenized and padded -> loaded model predicts sentiment -> sentiment labels assigned to nodes",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard model loading and inference procedures; no obfuscation or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code loads a sentiment analysis dataset, trains an LSTM model, saves the model and tokenizer, and defines a function to load these assets for inference on graph node texts. The function reads 'text' attributes, tokenizes, pads sequences, loads the model, predicts sentiment probabilities, and assigns 'positive' or 'negative' labels to nodes. The code performs standard ML tasks with no network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. External files are loaded during inference, which is typical. No suspicious data flows or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard sentiment analysis pipeline with no malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external model and tokenizer files, but within the code, there are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are justified as zero.",
