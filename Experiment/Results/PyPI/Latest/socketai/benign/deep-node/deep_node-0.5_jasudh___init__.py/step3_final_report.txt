  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Function arguments, environment variables, external modules, user input, network connections, hardcoded credentials.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file outputs, environment variables, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec).",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and user input flow into network functions, dynamic execution, or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, potential data exfiltration behaviors.",
  "analysis": "Benign reports (1-4) show no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code, with scores reflecting low risk (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2). Report 5 exhibits clear malicious indicators: obfuscation, dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity, and hardcoded credentials, justifying high scores (malware 0.75, obfuscated 0.7, risk 0.8). The scores are consistent with the detailed behaviors described. Benign reports are appropriately scored with minimal risk, while report 5's high suspicion is justified.",
  "conclusion": "The overall scoring aligns with the behaviors observed. Benign reports are correctly rated with low malware and obfuscation scores, and report 5's high scores accurately reflect malicious indicators. No adjustments are necessary; the assessments are consistent and justified.",
