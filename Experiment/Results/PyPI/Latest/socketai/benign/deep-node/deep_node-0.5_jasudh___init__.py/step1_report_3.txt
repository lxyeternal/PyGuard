{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that performs basic data processing or utility functions. No specific purpose indicating malicious intent is evident.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from function parameters, variables, or environment variables if present. No explicit input sources are identified in the visible code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include file operations, network requests, or system commands if used. However, the code does not demonstrate such operations explicitly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to processing functions, but without specific data manipulation or network calls, there are no suspicious source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious variable names, or unusual code constructs are detected. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with clear structure and no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns. It uses standard Python syntax and library functions. No data leaks, code injections, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The lack of network activity, encryption, or system modifications further reduces concern.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The script appears benign, with no malicious intent detected.",
