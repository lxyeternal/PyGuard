  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur at print statements, logging, or network communication functions if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output functions such as print or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are evident. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks evident malicious constructs such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. It utilizes standard Python functions and third-party libraries in a typical manner. No indicators of malware or sabotage are observed. The code is straightforward and appears legitimate, with no anomalies in structure or content.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code seems to serve a legitimate purpose, with no suspicious patterns detected.",
