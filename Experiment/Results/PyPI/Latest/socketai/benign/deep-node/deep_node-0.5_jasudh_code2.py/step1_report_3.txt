  "purpose": "Train and evaluate a convolutional neural network on the MNIST dataset for digit classification.",
  "sources": "Loading MNIST dataset using keras.datasets.mnist.load_data().",
  "sinks": "Model prediction and evaluation functions (model.predict, model.evaluate), printing outputs, displaying confusion matrix.",
  "flows": "Data loaded from dataset -> normalized and reshaped -> model trained -> predictions made -> confusion matrix and evaluation results generated.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. All code uses standard libraries and functions for machine learning tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script loads the MNIST dataset, preprocesses it, builds a standard CNN model, trains it, makes predictions, and displays evaluation metrics. No external network connections, system modifications, or suspicious code segments are present. All dependencies are well-known open-source libraries, and the code performs expected operations for a typical image classification task.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate machine learning script for classifying MNIST digits. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It solely uses standard libraries and functions for training, prediction, and evaluation.",
