{
  "purpose": "This code trains, evaluates, and visualizes a convolutional neural network for classifying MNIST handwritten digits using TensorFlow/Keras.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from the MNIST dataset via keras.datasets.mnist.load_data(), which is an open dataset; no external or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs visualization (plots) and prints evaluation metrics; no untrusted data is written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded and processed internally; model training and evaluation are performed in-memory; no external data flows or network connections are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; standard ML procedures are used.",
  "analysis": "The script loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset, constructs a standard CNN model, trains it for 5 epochs, and evaluates its performance, including visualization of confusion matrix and classification report. No external or hidden code, data leaks, or suspicious activities are observed. All operations are consistent with typical ML workflows. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of an MNIST classifier using TensorFlow/Keras with no malicious or suspicious elements. It performs standard data loading, model training, and evaluation tasks, with no evidence of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
