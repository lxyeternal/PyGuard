{
  "purpose": "Build, train, and evaluate a convolutional neural network for MNIST digit classification using TensorFlow/Keras.",
  "sources": "Loading data via keras.datasets.mnist.load_data(), reading input data; no external inputs during runtime; using imported libraries for data processing, model training, and evaluation.",
  "sinks": "Model prediction outputs, evaluation metrics, and visualization with matplotlib.pyplot; no data exfiltration, system modification, or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded, normalized, and encoded; flows into model training. Predictions are generated from the trained model, then used to compute confusion matrix and classification report.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code segments, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected. Usage of standard libraries and typical data flow patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code follows a standard machine learning pipeline for image classification: loading data, preprocessing, model definition, training, evaluation, and visualization. All components are commonly used for such tasks. No obfuscated code, hidden modules, or suspicious network activity are present. The code does not perform any external calls besides standard library functions, nor does it include any malicious or maliciously crafted code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an MNIST classifier using TensorFlow/Keras with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical data processing, model training, and evaluation without any suspicious behavior.",
