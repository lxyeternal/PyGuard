{
  "purpose": "This code implements a standard MNIST digit classifier using TensorFlow and Keras, involving data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the keras.datasets.mnist.load_data() function and uses standard libraries for model building, training, and visualization.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs predictions, evaluation metrics, and visualizations; no external network connections or data exfiltration are present.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from the dataset source, preprocessed, fed into the model for training and prediction, then results are evaluated and visualized locally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an MNIST classifier using well-known libraries and standard practices. It does not contain any external network activity, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The data flows are typical for such ML pipelines, with no anomalies or suspicious operations. The code is readable, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threats. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or revision is necessary.",
