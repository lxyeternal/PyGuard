  "purpose": "Train and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) for MNIST digit classification.",
  "sources": "mnist.load_data() for dataset; standard input/output via model.predict and model.evaluate; matplotlib for plotting.",
  "sinks": "model.predict(), model.evaluate(), print statements, plotting functions (plt.show()).",
  "flows": "Data loaded from mnist.load_data() -> preprocessed and fed into model.fit() -> predictions generated with model.predict() -> results displayed via print and plot functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Usage of standard libraries and functions in expected ways.",
  "analysis": "The code loads MNIST dataset, normalizes images, one-hot encodes labels, builds a CNN model, trains it, predicts on test data, and visualizes results. All libraries and functions are standard for image classification tasks. No code indicates malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or backdoors. The plotting and evaluation functions are typical for model analysis. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard training and evaluation of a MNIST classifier using TensorFlow/Keras. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and follows common machine learning procedures. No security risks or malware indications are evident.",
