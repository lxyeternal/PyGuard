  "purpose": "Standard sentiment analysis pipeline using TensorFlow and Keras on the IMDB dataset, involving data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Loading dataset from tf.keras.datasets.imdb, reading data during training and evaluation, and visualization functions for plotting results.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity, file writing, or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading through preprocessing to model training, evaluation, prediction, and visualization; no external or malicious data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a sentiment analysis ML pipeline using trusted libraries and datasets. It does not include any network activity, external data handling beyond the dataset, or obfuscated code. The logic follows standard practices without suspicious behaviors. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Minor variations in security risk scores (e.g., 0.1) are acceptable given the dataset source but could be slightly lowered for consistency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard ML pipeline with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify this, assigning appropriate low or zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. No adjustments are necessary.",
