{
  "purpose": "Build, train, evaluate, and visualize an LSTM-based sentiment analysis model on the IMDB dataset.",
  "sources": "Loading dataset via tf.keras.datasets.imdb.load_data; reading data from the dataset; setting random seed with tf.random.set_seed.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data is processed in a harmful way; all data is from a trusted source (TensorFlow dataset).",
  "flows": "Dataset loading -> data preprocessing -> model training -> evaluation -> prediction -> visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. Usage of standard libraries and functions appears typical for a machine learning pipeline.",
  "analysis": "The code loads the IMDB dataset from TensorFlow's dataset module, processes text data into padded sequences, and constructs an LSTM model for sentiment classification. It trains the model and evaluates its performance, then visualizes the results. All library usage and data handling follow standard ML practices. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are involved beyond the trusted dataset. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity detected. The code contains no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical machine learning pipeline for sentiment analysis with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It relies solely on trusted libraries and datasets, with no suspicious or harmful behaviors identified.",
