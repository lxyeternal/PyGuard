{
  "purpose": "Build, train, and evaluate a sentiment analysis model using TensorFlow on the IMDB dataset.",
  "sources": "Loads IMDB dataset from tf.keras.datasets, reads input data during dataset loading, and uses standard TensorFlow and sklearn functions for processing and evaluation.",
  "sinks": "Outputs classification report, confusion matrix plot, and training history plots; no untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Loads dataset -> preprocesses data -> builds and trains model -> evaluates and predicts -> outputs results and plots.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network connections, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard machine learning workflow: dataset loading, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization. All steps utilize well-known libraries with no suspicious or malicious function calls. No use of network connections, no file operations outside standard dataset load, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated parts. The code does not contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical machine learning pipeline for sentiment analysis using TensorFlow. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely uses open-source libraries for data processing, model training, and visualization.",
