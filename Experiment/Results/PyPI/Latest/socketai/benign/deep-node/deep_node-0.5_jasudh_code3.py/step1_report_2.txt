  "purpose": "The code loads IMDB movie review data, trains an LSTM-based neural network to perform sentiment analysis, and visualizes the results including confusion matrix and training history.",
  "sources": "tf.keras.datasets.imdb.load_data, tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences, model.predict, model.evaluate",
  "sinks": "model.predict output, print statements, plt.show()",
  "flows": "Data loaded from dataset -> padded -> input to model -> model predicts probabilities -> thresholds to class labels -> display results",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, no unusual or obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, no hidden or malicious backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an NLP sentiment classifier using TensorFlow. It loads a well-known dataset, processes it, builds a typical LSTM model, trains it, evaluates it, and visualizes results. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. It utilizes common libraries with legitimate purposes. There are no suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or unusual data flows. The code appears to be a benign example or a typical tutorial script.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard, benign implementation for sentiment analysis using TensorFlow and related libraries. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
