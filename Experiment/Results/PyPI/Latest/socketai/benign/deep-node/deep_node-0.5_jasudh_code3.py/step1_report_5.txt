{
  "purpose": "This code loads the IMDB dataset, builds and trains an LSTM-based sentiment analysis model, evaluates its performance, and visualizes results.",
  "sources": "tf.keras.datasets.imdb.load_data(), tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(), model.predict()",
  "sinks": "Model evaluation, predictions, and plotting functions, which do not involve untrusted data sinks or external data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from the dataset, preprocessed, fed into the model, and predictions are generated for evaluation and visualization; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. No network connections, data leaks, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a well-known public dataset, builds a standard neural network model, trains it, and visualizes results. All functions and data flows are typical for machine learning workflows. No use of untrusted external inputs, no data exfiltration, and no suspicious behavior are evident. The code appears to be a legitimate, straightforward implementation for sentiment analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard machine learning implementation with no malicious behavior detected. It performs data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization without suspicious or harmful actions.",
