{
  "purpose": "The code loads IMDB movie review data, trains an LSTM-based sentiment analysis model, evaluates its performance, and visualizes results.",
  "sources": "tf.keras.datasets.imdb.load_data() for data loading; tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences() for data preprocessing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicate untrusted data handling; model training, evaluation, and visualization do not contain data leaks or malicious outputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source (load_data) through preprocessing to model input; predictions are generated, then visualizations and reports are produced; no untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated segments present; code appears standard for model training pipeline.",
  "analysis": "The code securely loads datasets, preprocesses sequences, constructs and trains an LSTM model with dropout for regularization, evaluates model performance, and visualizes results. No indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. Usage of TensorFlow, Keras, matplotlib, and sklearn libraries is typical for machine learning workflows. The code does not include any suspicious dynamic execution, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated parts. It functions as a standard ML training and evaluation script.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs legitimate sentiment analysis training and evaluation without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical ML pipeline with no malicious behavior detected.",
