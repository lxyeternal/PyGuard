  "purpose": "The code is designed to load, preprocess, train, evaluate, and visualize a CNN model for image classification of rice images.",
  "sources": "Paths for dataset directories, data reading via os.listdir, shutil.move for splitting data, and model prediction outputs.",
  "sinks": "Model.predict output, classification report, confusion matrix visualization, potential file movement during dataset split.",
  "flows": "Data loaded from directories -> training/validation split (shuffling and moving files) -> model training -> model prediction -> visualization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of shutil.move for dataset splitting could alter original dataset structure but is standard; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code observed; no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard dataset preparation by shuffling and splitting data with shutil.move, which is safe but alters original files. The model training and evaluation follow typical procedures with no suspicious code. Data flow from directories to model and visualizations is straightforward. No external network calls, no code injection, or malicious activities are present. All operations are consistent with typical image classification workflows. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard machine learning pipeline for image classification with dataset splitting, model training, and evaluation. No malicious intent or suspicious activity is detected. The only minor concern is dataset manipulation, which is a common practice, not malicious.",
