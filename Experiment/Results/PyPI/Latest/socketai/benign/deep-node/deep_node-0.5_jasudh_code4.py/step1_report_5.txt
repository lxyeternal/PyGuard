{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for training and evaluating an image classification model using TensorFlow/Keras on a rice dataset, including data preparation, model training, and performance visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from dataset directories, loads libraries, and reads input data from filesystem; also reads class labels and dataset structure.",
  "sinks": "Uses model prediction outputs, displays confusion matrix, and classification report; no data exfiltration or untrusted data sinks are apparent.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset directories into image data generators, then into the model for training and prediction, with results visualized locally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures; code structure is typical for ML workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dataset splitting, image preprocessing, CNN model creation, training with early stopping, and evaluation. The dataset split involves moving files between directories, which is normal for dataset preparation. The code uses standard libraries and functions with no suspicious or malicious calls. No code injection, unsafe operations, or network activity is present. All data handling appears limited to filesystem operations and local processing. The code includes data visualization for evaluation but does not contain any covert or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard image classification pipeline without malicious behavior or suspicious activity. It does not include any backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network operations. It is a typical example of a supervised learning workflow for image data.",
