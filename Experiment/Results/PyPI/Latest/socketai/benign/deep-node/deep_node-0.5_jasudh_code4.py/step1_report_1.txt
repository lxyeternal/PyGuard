{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to preprocess rice image data, split into training, validation, and test sets, build and train a convolutional neural network for image classification, and evaluate its performance with confusion matrix and classification report.",
  "sources": "Reads dataset directories, loads images via ImageDataGenerator, and processes image files from the dataset directories.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include model predictions, confusion matrix visualization, and classification report, which do not involve untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset directories into image data generators, then through the model for predictions, and finally into evaluation metrics and visualizations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code performs standard data processing, model training, and evaluation tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script loads image datasets, splits data into training, validation, and test sets, constructs a CNN model, trains it, and evaluates its performance. All steps are standard in machine learning workflows. No code injection, malicious data handling, or suspicious network activity is observed. No hardcoded secrets or unusual logic are present. Visualization and evaluation outputs are typical for such tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate data processing and model training for image classification without any indication of malicious intent or security risks. It contains standard practices with no suspicious or malicious code segments.",
