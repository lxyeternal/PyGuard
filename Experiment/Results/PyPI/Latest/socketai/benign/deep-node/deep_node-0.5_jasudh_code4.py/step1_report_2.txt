{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to train and evaluate a convolutional neural network for classifying rice images from a dataset, including data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from dataset directories; loads data using ImageDataGenerator; reads class labels and directory structures.",
  "sinks": "Outputs evaluation plots (confusion matrix), prints classification report, and saves/loads data/models if applicable (not explicitly shown here).",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from directory structure into training, validation, and test datasets; predictions are made on test data; evaluation outputs are generated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments observed. The code appears standard for an image classification task. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script follows a typical machine learning pipeline for image classification: setting paths, creating validation splits, defining data generators, building a CNN model, training with early stopping, and evaluating performance via confusion matrix and classification report. All operations are standard, with no suspicious or malicious actions. No external network communication, data exfiltration, or system disruption code is present. The dataset handling and model training are straightforward and conform to common practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of an image classification task using Keras, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs data loading, model training, and evaluation in a standard manner. No malicious or harmful behaviors are evident.",
