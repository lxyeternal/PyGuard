{
  "purpose": "The code preprocesses image data, constructs a convolutional neural network, trains it for rice image classification, and evaluates its performance.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from specified directories (Rice_dataset/Rice_Image_Dataset/train, test).",
  "sinks": "Uses the trained model to predict on test data and displays a confusion matrix and classification report.",
  "flows": "Loads image files -> splits data into train/validation -> preprocesses data -> trains CNN -> predicts on test data -> displays results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No suspicious network activity or data leaks. Uses standard libraries and processes for image classification.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard image data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. It creates validation data by splitting training data, which is a common practice. No suspicious or malicious operations such as network communication, system manipulation, or covert data exfiltration are present. The code employs typical deep learning routines with popular libraries, with no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. No credentials or sensitive info are stored or transmitted. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate image classification pipeline without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical deep learning image classification pipeline with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It performs data preparation, model training, and evaluation securely, using standard methods. There are no indications of malware or malicious sabotage.",
