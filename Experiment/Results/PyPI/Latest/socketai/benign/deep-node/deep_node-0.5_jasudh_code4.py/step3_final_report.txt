{
  "purpose": "This code implements an image classification pipeline for rice dataset images, including dataset splitting, data augmentation, CNN model training, and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Reads dataset directories, loads images via flow_from_directory, and moves files during dataset splitting.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Source: dataset directory reading and file movement; Sink: model training and evaluation; Data flows from filesystem to model inputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of shutil.move to split datasets modifies original files; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard ML tasks: dataset splitting, image preprocessing, CNN training, and evaluation. Dataset splitting via shutil.move is common but alters original data, which could be a minor security concern if dataset integrity is critical. No suspicious or malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The code is clear, straightforward, and follows typical practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate image classification pipeline with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The minor dataset file movement is standard but slightly elevates the security risk score. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
