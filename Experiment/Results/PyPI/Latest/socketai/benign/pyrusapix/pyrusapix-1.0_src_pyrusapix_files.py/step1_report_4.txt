  "purpose": "This code provides a FilesAPI class for uploading and retrieving files through an HTTP API with token-based authentication.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from file system (file_path in upload_file), and retrieves tokens via authenticator methods.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external server using requests.post and requests.get with authorization headers; JSON responses are returned.",
  "flows": "File content is read from disk and sent in POST request; access tokens are retrieved, refreshed if needed, and used in headers; responses are processed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code structures; exception handling appears standard. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code manages file uploads and retrieval with token-based authentication, handling token refresh securely. It uses standard libraries and practices for HTTP communication. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration methods are evident. The code does not include malicious behavior such as data theft, system modification, or hidden network activity. It performs expected operations for an API client with proper error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client for file operations with standard security practices. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks in this code snippet.",
