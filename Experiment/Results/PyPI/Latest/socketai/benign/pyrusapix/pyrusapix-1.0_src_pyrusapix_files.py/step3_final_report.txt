  "purpose": "Provides methods for uploading and retrieving files via an API, managing access tokens securely.",
  "sources": "Retrieves access tokens via authenticator; reads files from disk; receives responses from requests.",
  "sinks": "Response handling may process untrusted data; token refresh could involve untrusted tokens; file content is read from disk.",
  "flows": "Authenticator supplies tokens -> requests send data -> responses processed -> token refresh if 401 -> data returned or errors raised.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client with proper token management, error handling, and file operations. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. The logic is straightforward, and the code does not contain obfuscation or malicious intent. The response handling is typical, and no data leaks or backdoors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure API client with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the scores are justified. No further action is necessary.",
