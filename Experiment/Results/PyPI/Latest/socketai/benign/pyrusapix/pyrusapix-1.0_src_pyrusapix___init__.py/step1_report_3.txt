{
  "purpose": "Define a Python API client class (PyrusAPI) that dynamically imports and initializes various API components (FormsAPI, TasksAPI, FilesAPI, CatalogAPI, Extractor) upon first access, and delegates method calls starting with 'get_' to the FormsAPI instance.",
  "sources": "Initialization of class attributes (_forms, _tasks, _files, _catalog, _extractor); property methods that import submodules (.forms, .tasks, .files, .catalog, .extractor); __getattr__ method for dynamic delegation.",
  "sinks": "Method calls to self.forms, self.tasks, self.files, self.catalog, self.extractor; dynamic attribute access via __getattr__",
  "flows": "Access to property methods triggers imports and object creation; attribute access starting with 'get_' delegates to self.forms; calls to these properties or delegated methods lead to execution of imported class constructors or methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of local relative imports within property methods, which is common but can be manipulated if the package structure is compromised. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that acts as a lazy loader for API components, importing modules only when needed. It uses property decorators for initialization, reducing startup overhead. The __getattr__ method delegates certain method calls to the forms API, which may extend API functionality dynamically. The imports are local and within the class, which is standard for lazy loading but can obscure direct inspection of dependencies. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious network activity is evident. The code appears to be a straightforward API client setup with dynamic import and delegation logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client class with lazy loading and dynamic method delegation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation is typical for a modular, extensible API client in Python.",
