{
  "purpose": "Provides a modular API client with lazy-loaded components and delegated method access for a larger system.",
  "sources": "Class initialization, property methods importing sub-APIs, __getattr__ method delegating 'get_' methods to forms API.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network activity or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Attribute access triggers lazy import and instantiation of sub-APIs; __getattr__ delegates 'get_' methods to forms API.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import 'os' present; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard patterns for modular API clients: lazy loading via property methods, local relative imports, and attribute delegation. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The import of 'os' is unused but benign. The delegation pattern via __getattr__ is common and not suspicious. Overall, the code is clear, maintainable, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign API wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware score remains at zero. The only minor note is the unused 'import os', which does not impact security.",
