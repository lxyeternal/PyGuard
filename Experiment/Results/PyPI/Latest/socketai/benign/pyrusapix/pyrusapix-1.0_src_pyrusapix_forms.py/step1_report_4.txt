{
  "purpose": "The code provides an asynchronous API client for interacting with form data on a server, including retrieving form lists, details, and filtered registries.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, local variables, and external API responses via the authenticator.request_with_token method.",
  "sinks": "The code passes data to external API requests and performs data filtering and extraction via the extractor object; however, it does not directly write to files, execute system commands, or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to build request parameters for API calls (source), and responses are processed and returned, sometimes filtered or transformed. Data flows from parameters and API responses to returned values, with filtering via extractor methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual language features. The code handles exceptions appropriately. No suspicious or malicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements an asynchronous API client class for forms, with methods to fetch form lists, details, and registries with various filters. It constructs request parameters dynamically, invokes external API requests via the authenticator, and processes responses. Exception handling is present, and data filtering or extraction is delegated to an extractor object. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code's structure is standard, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured API client with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It handles data securely without hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior. The overall security risk is low.",
