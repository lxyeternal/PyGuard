{
  "purpose": "The code provides an asynchronous API client class for interacting with forms, including fetching form lists, details, and filtered registries.",
  "sources": "Inputs from method parameters (e.g., form_id, steps, filter_value), environment variables via self.authenticator (base_url, request_with_token), and external dependencies (aiohttp, Extractor, APIRequestError).",
  "sinks": "Network requests via authenticator.request_with_token, potentially exposing untrusted data if inputs are maliciously crafted; no other external sinks identified.",
  "flows": "User-provided parameters flow into request URLs and query parameters; data from network responses flows into processing and return statements, including filtering and extraction steps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of optional parameters and dynamic URL construction appears standard. No obfuscated code or unusual logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as an API client, making HTTP GET requests through an authenticator object, processing responses, and optionally filtering or extracting data. Input parameters are used to build request URLs and parameters without evident unsafe handling. External dependencies like Extractor are used for data processing; their internal security depends on implementation but is not inherently suspicious. Error handling wraps exceptions into custom APIRequestError exceptions. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The structure and logic appear typical for a form API client.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured API client for form data retrieval with no evident malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It does not include suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. Based on the provided code alone, it is considered safe with low malware and security risk scores.",
