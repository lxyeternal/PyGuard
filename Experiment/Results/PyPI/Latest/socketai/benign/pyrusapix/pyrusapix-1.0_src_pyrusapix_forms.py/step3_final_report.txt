{
  "purpose": "This code implements an asynchronous API client for managing forms, utilizing external authenticators and extractors for data retrieval and processing.",
  "sources": "External API responses from authenticator.request_with_token calls, input parameters for filtering and data selection.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from API responses, filtered or processed via extractor methods, and returned to the caller.",
  "flows": "API responses flow into filtering/extraction functions, then into return statements, with optional filtering by task data or field extraction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. No external or internal code exhibits unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard async API client with proper error handling, modular design, and delegation of data processing to external components. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration. External dependencies are assumed trustworthy but depend on their own security. The code does not perform any insecure operations, code injection, or data leakage. No obfuscation or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal concerns. The confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9).",
