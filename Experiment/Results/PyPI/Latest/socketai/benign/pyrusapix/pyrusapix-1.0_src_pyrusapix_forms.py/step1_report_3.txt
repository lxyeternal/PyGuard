{
  "purpose": "This code provides an asynchronous API client for interacting with forms data, including retrieving form lists, details, and filtered registries.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from parameters such as form_id, steps, task_ids, filters, and kwargs. Uses self.authenticator.request_with_token to fetch data from remote endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data includes responses from API requests (forms data, registries, task details), and input parameters for filtering and request customization.",
  "flows": "Sources (input parameters and API responses) flow into request construction, with API responses being processed, filtered, or transformed by extractor methods before output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors detected. Use of dynamic URL construction is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. No data exfiltration or malicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely constructs API request URLs and parameters, and handles exceptions appropriately. The use of an external authenticator and extractor indicates modular design. There is no evidence of malicious code or behavior; all data flows appear to be standard API interactions and data processing. No hidden or malicious logic, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code relies on external components for sensitive operations, which is typical. No suspicious or malicious activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate API client implementation with no malicious intent. It handles data securely and does not contain any obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious behavior. Overall security risk is very low.",
