  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code solely defines custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception class.\n   - There are no data flows, input/output operations, or external data handling.\n   - The classes are straightforward, with descriptive Russian docstrings, serving error handling purposes.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Code or Security Risks**:\n   - No reports detect any malicious behavior, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, handle untrusted data, or execute dynamic code.\n   - The consistent conclusion across all reports is that this code is benign and standard.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:\n   - No errors or flaws are identified; the code is syntactically correct and follows standard Python practices for custom exceptions.\n   - The reasoning in all reports aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscation scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, matching the analysis.\n   - Confidence scores are high (1), which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   \n5. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:\n   - No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the reports correctly state that the code is harmless.\n   - Since the code is only class definitions, there is no basis for higher risk scores.\n\n**Summary of my assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommendations**:\n- I agree with the provided scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- The confidence levels are justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis code snippet is a typical, safe pattern for defining custom exceptions in a Python library, with no security concerns.",
