  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Security Risks:**\n   - All reports agree that the code only defines custom exception classes with descriptive docstrings in Russian.\n   - No input/output operations, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n   - The code appears to be a standard, benign part of a larger library.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Aspects:**\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment that the code is straightforward and serves solely for error handling.\n   - No anomalies, unusual behaviors, or security issues are identified.\n   - The reasoning is sound; defining exception classes is a common pattern in Python libraries.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Justification:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the evidence.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume no malicious intent because the code is purely structural.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation or hidden payloads.\n   - The Russian docstrings do not impact security but should be noted for localization if needed.\n\n5. **Final Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard, non-malicious, non-obfuscated set of exception class definitions.\n   - The risk scores should remain at 0 for malware and security risk.\n   - The confidence level is high, given the consistent analysis.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign and typical for error handling in a Python library.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.",
