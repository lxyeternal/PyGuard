  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a library related to Pyrus API.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; code defines classes only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or output operations; class definitions are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard custom exception classes inheriting from a base error class, with descriptive comments in Russian. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The classes do not perform any operations or handle data; they simply define exception types.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward, defining custom exceptions for error handling with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger library, with no signs of malware or security issues.",
