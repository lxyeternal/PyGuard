  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling within a library.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code solely defines exception classes.",

  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base error class. No external inputs, data processing, or suspicious logic present. The class structures are straightforward, standard Python practice for custom exceptions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign code defining exception classes with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
