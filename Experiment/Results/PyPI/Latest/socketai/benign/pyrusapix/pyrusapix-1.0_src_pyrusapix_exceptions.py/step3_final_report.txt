  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and docstrings; no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static class definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with descriptive Russian docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception, with no dynamic behavior, input/output, or external data handling. The Russian docstrings serve for localization but do not impact security. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is standard and benign, serving error handling purposes. All reports correctly identify this, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence (1). The reasoning is consistent and justified given the simplicity and purpose of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
