  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\n- The code defines five custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception class.\n- All classes have descriptive Russian docstrings explaining their purpose.\n- The classes are purely structural, with no methods, data processing, input/output, or dynamic behavior.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The code is standard for error handling in Python libraries.\n\n**Assessment of the reports:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, with no data flows, external inputs, or suspicious behavior.\n- The confidence levels are all at 1, indicating certainty that the code is benign.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, aligning with the analysis that there is no malicious activity.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are very uniform and dismissive of any potential risk, which is consistent with the code.\n- Since the code is simple class definitions, there is no basis for higher malware or obfuscation scores.\n- The reasoning in all reports is sound; they do not overstate or understate the risk.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware: 0 is correct; no malicious code detected.\n- Obfuscated: 0 is correct; code is clear and straightforward.\n- Risk: 0 is appropriate; no security issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The current scores and reasoning are accurate and reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Based on the evidence, I agree with the current scores and conclusions.",
