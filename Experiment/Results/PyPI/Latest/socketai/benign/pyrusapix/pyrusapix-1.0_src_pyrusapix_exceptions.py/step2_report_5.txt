  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception class, with descriptive Russian docstrings.\n   - No input/output operations, data handling, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The code appears to be a standard, benign part of a larger library.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is purely structural for error handling.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The assessments about security and malicious intent are justified and reasonable.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No issues with high risk scores; all are correctly low.\n   - The code is not performing any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not rely on assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No unwarranted security concerns are raised.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and justified based on the analysis.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at 0.\n- No changes needed; the reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, and the reports correctly identify it as such. No security concerns or malicious activity are present.",
