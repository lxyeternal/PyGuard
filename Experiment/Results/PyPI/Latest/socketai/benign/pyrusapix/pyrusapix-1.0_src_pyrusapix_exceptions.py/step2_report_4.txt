  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it against the code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of straightforward custom exception class definitions with descriptive Russian docstrings. There are no data flows, no input/output, no data processing, and no suspicious or malicious behavior. The code is static and purely structural.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is benign, standard, and free of security issues or malware. No logical errors, code flaws, or suspicious patterns are detected. The reasoning is sound and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- Confidence: 1 (or 1.0), which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and clarity.\n- Obfuscated: 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- Malware: 0, correctly indicating no malware.\n- SecurityRisk: 0, correctly indicating no security risk.\n\nThese scores are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**  \nSince all reports agree that the code is benign and there are no signs of malicious activity, no higher risk scores are justified. The code is purely structural, with no dynamic or security-sensitive operations.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nAll reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nNo report makes unwarranted assumptions; they all base their conclusions on the static nature of the code.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**  \nScores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n### Additional Notes:\nGiven the code's simplicity, the risk is minimal. The only potential concern would be if this code was part of a larger malicious package, but on its own, it’s harmless.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n- The code is standard, benign, and poses no security threat.\n- Scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk. No further action needed.",
