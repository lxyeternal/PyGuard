{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors in a library related to API interactions and data extraction.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs or untrusted data sources are read; code only defines classes.",
  "targets": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no data leakage, injection, or malicious actions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data handling occurring; only class definitions with no methods or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; straightforward class inheritance and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception, with docstrings describing each error type. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or security-sensitive functions. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are present. The code is purely structural for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
