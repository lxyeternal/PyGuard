  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors within the Pyrus API library.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; this code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception. It is straightforward and only establishes error types for use elsewhere in the library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, obfuscated code, or suspicious activities. The code does not perform any input/output operations, network access, or execute dynamic code. Overall, this is a standard pattern for error handling in Python libraries.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining exception classes and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign and standard part of a larger codebase.",
