  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors in a library, likely related to API interactions and data processing.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading occurs within this code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, network communication, or external data handling is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class definitions for exception handling without any unusual or suspicious code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception class, with docstrings in Russian describing their purpose. There are no input, output, or external data handling operations. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, safe, and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a typical error handling structure in a Python library.",
