  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of asynchronous utility methods for parsing, filtering, and extracting data from JSON representations of tasks.\n- It performs JSON parsing, filtering based on field values, recursive extraction, and field searching.\n- There are no network calls, no system modifications, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or suspicious code.\n- The code relies on standard libraries (`json`, `aiohttp`) and a custom exception class (`ExtractorError`).\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears to be a legitimate data processing utility.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility for processing JSON tasks, filtering, extracting fields.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, no suspicious logic.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, justified by the benign nature)\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe and legitimate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues with the scoring or reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Async utility for extracting/filtering task data.\n- **Analysis:** Standard JSON parsing, no malicious behavior, no network activity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Well justified, no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, consistent, and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Data extraction/filtering utility.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no external system interaction.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, due to potential data handling concerns, but no actual threat)\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Processing/filtering task data.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, safe data handling.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security concern)\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Data extraction/filtering from JSON task structures.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, no external calls, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, as it is a data utility)\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there are no malicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated:** All correctly assign 0.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low, justified by the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n\n- The scores for malware and obfuscated are appropriate and consistent.\n- The risk scores are conservative and justified, given the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Should remain low (around 0.1–0.2), reflecting the utility nature of the code and absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are thorough, accurate, and consistent with the code content. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The scores appropriately reflect the benign and standard nature of the code.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\nThis analysis confirms the code is safe, with no security threats or malicious features.",
