  "purpose": "Utility for processing, filtering, and extracting data from JSON task structures, including nested fields.",
  "sources": "JSON input data (string, dict, list), reading 'fields', 'code', 'value' in task and field objects.",
  "sinks": "In-memory data structures; no external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "JSON data parsed into objects -> filtering and extraction functions access 'fields' and 'value' -> collected into output dicts.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Exception handling is broad but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard JSON parsing, filtering, and recursive data extraction without external interactions or malicious patterns. No network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present. Exception handling is broad but does not introduce risks. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, legitimate utility for JSON task data processing. No malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low security risk score is justified by the nature of data parsing, and malware score remains at 0.",
