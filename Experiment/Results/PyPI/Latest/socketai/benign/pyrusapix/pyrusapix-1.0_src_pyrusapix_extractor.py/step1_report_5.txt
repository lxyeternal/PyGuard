  "purpose": "A utility class for processing and extracting data from JSON-based task structures, including filtering, extracting fields, and searching fields by code and ID.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as json_data (string, dict, list), tasks, task details, and field data within task objects.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks involved; code manipulates data structures internally, no network, file, or system command execution detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (json_data, tasks, task details) through processing functions (filter_tasks_by_value, extract_task_fields, search_fields_by_codes_with_ids), resulting in returned filtered or extracted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. Usage of exception handling that suppresses errors could hide issues, but not malicious. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no external calls beyond imports. The imports are standard for async HTTP and JSON handling, and no dangerous code appears.",
  "analysis": "The code provides methods for filtering and extracting data from JSON structures representing tasks, with flexible handling of input formats. It uses standard Python libraries, with careful parsing and recursion for nested fields. No evidence of malicious intent or malicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications. Exception handling is present but does not involve malicious behavior; it merely skips problematic tasks or fields. No hardcoded secrets, external calls, or obfuscated logic are present. The structure and logic are straightforward, focusing solely on data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for data extraction from task-related JSON structures. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or malware. It performs data filtering and extraction securely without external side effects. The overall security risk is negligible.",
