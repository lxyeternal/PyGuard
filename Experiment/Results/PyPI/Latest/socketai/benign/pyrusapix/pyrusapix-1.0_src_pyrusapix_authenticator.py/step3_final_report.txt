  "purpose": "An async API client managing bearer token authentication with refresh logic upon invalid or expired tokens.",
  "sources": "User credentials provided during initialization; API responses containing tokens and error codes.",
  "sinks": "Authorization headers in requests; response data including error codes indicating token status.",
  "flows": "Authenticate -> store token -> make API request -> detect token invalidation -> re-authenticate -> retry request.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious dynamic code; standard exception handling and token management.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured async API client implementing token-based authentication with refresh logic. It handles network errors and token invalidation correctly, without any signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data leaks. The token is stored in an instance variable, and requests are made with proper headers. No hardcoded secrets are present; all sensitive data are passed as parameters. The error handling is appropriate, and the logic aligns with best practices for such clients.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and standard implementation of an async API client with token refresh capabilities. No malicious, suspicious, or obfuscated behavior is detected. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware score is correctly set to zero.",
