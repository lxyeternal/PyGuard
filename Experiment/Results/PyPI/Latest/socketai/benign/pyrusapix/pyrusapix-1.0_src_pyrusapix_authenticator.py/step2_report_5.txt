  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for any issues, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard async API client handling token-based authentication with refresh logic.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or URLs are present.\n- No obfuscated code, suspicious dynamic execution, or backdoors are evident.\n- Exception handling is appropriate.\n- The token refresh logic is correctly implemented.\n- No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or malware are detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes token management.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is standard, low risk, no malware.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies standard token refresh and request handling.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, proper token management.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, standard API client.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Proper token handling, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scores:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, matching the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly varying (0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable given the code handles sensitive tokens but does not contain hardcoded secrets or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** — low, consistent with standard API client code.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, mainly due to handling sensitive tokens, but no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client with proper token management, no obfuscation, and no malicious intent. The assigned scores are reasonable and should not be changed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nScores are appropriate; no further action needed.",
