{
  "purpose": "This code provides an asynchronous authentication and request handling mechanism for interacting with an API, managing access tokens and handling token invalidation scenarios.",
  "sources": "Reads user credentials ('login' and 'secret'), API URLs, and request parameters.",
  "sinks": "Sends requests with sensitive tokens and credentials, potentially exposing tokens if logs or errors are mishandled (though not directly shown).",
  "flows": "Reads credentials → authenticates to obtain token → uses token in API requests → handles token invalidation by re-authenticating and retrying.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Proper exception handling, no obfuscated code, and no malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages tokens, performs API requests, and handles token expiration by re-authenticating. It uses standard libraries and proper error handling. No unusual data flows, hidden behaviors, or malicious code segments are present. All functions follow typical async request patterns. No signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or supply chain sabotage are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured API client with secure token management and error handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It is safe based on the provided code fragment.",
