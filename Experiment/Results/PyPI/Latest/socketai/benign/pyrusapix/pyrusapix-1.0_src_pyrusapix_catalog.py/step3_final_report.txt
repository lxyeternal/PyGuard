  "purpose": "Asynchronous API client for managing catalogs in the Pyrus API, performing CRUD operations, searches, and matrix manipulations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as catalog_id, search_value, upsert, delete, and data from API responses.",
  "sinks": "API requests over network via 'request_with_token', data returned to caller, and potential data influence from untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence API request URLs and payloads; responses are processed and returned; untrusted data can affect API calls and data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Code is straightforward and readable.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard async API client with functions for retrieving, creating, updating, and manipulating catalog data. It performs input validation, handles exceptions properly, and relies on an external secure request method. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious network activity are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for catalog management with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk scores are justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores should remain at zero.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
