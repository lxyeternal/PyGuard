{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling API errors related to TatrapayPlus, encapsulating different error response models.",
  "sources": "Input source is the error_body parameter in the __init__ method, which accepts various error response models; no other input sources.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method calls to_dict() on error_body, which could potentially expose internal data if to_dict() includes sensitive information, but this is standard practice.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the error_body parameter into the error_body attribute, and then potentially to string output via __str__, but no external data flows or untrusted inputs are processed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward: it defines a class with a constructor and string representation. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception class that encapsulates error response models, allowing for custom error messages. It accepts multiple error model types via Union, stores them, and converts them to string for display. The use of to_dict() suggests error details can be serialized, which is standard. There are no code injection, malicious data handling, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a typical error handling pattern without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless exception class used for API error handling. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It’s designed for clear error reporting within an application.",
