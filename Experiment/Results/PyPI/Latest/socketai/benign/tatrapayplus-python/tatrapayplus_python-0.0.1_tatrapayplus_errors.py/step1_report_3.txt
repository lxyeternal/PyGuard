{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling API error responses related to TatrapayPlus, encapsulating different error body models.",
  "sources": "The class constructor receives an error_body parameter which can be one of three imported error models.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method calls to_dict() on error_body, potentially exposing internal error details.",
  "flows": "Error body is assigned during initialization and later converted to string via __str__, which could expose sensitive error information if printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The use of to_dict() on error_body could potentially leak internal error details but is standard for error messages.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception that encapsulates error data from specific error models. The __str__ method converts error_body to a dictionary and returns its string representation, which is typical for error reporting. No external inputs, network activity, or data manipulation is present. The imported models are not suspicious by themselves. Overall, the code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles error encapsulation in a common pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard implementation of a custom exception class for handling API errors, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
