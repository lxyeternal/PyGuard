  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring and conclusions.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code defines a simple custom exception class, `TatrapayPlusApiException`, which encapsulates error responses of specific models.\n- The class stores an error body of various types and converts it to a dictionary string via `to_dict()` in `__str__`.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The models are imported from `tatrapayplus.models`, and the error_body is typed with a Union of specific models.\n- The use of `to_dict()` is standard for serializing error objects.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Risks:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, the code appears straightforward and correctly implemented.\n- **Malicious behavior or backdoors:** No, nothing suspicious or malicious is evident.\n- **Potential data leakage via `__str__`:** While calling `to_dict()` could expose internal data, this is typical for error messages, and unless `to_dict()` includes sensitive info, this is acceptable.\n- **Security implications:** The code itself is safe, with no evident security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; no malicious code or behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.1. Since the code is simple and safe, a score of 0.1 for potential data exposure is reasonable, but generally, it should be 0 unless there's a known risk.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The overall scores seem reasonable. The only minor point is that `securityRisk` is assigned 0.1 in some reports, citing potential data exposure via `to_dict()`. Given the context, this is a cautious but acceptable assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Critical analysis of each report:\n\n1. **Report 1:**\n   - **Conclusion:** Safe, standard exception class.\n   - **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — appropriate.\n   - **Note:** No issues.\n\n2. **Report 2:**\n   - **Conclusion:** Also standard, no malicious behavior.\n   - **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n   - **Note:** Correct.\n\n3. **Report 3:**\n   - **Conclusion:** Standard implementation.\n   - **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n   - **Note:** Correct.\n\n4. **Report 4:**\n   - **Concern:** Slightly higher securityRisk (0.1) due to potential data leak via `to_dict()`.\n   - **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.1.\n   - **Note:** Reasonable, but in practice, unless `to_dict()` exposes sensitive info, this is overcautious.\n\n5. **Report 5:**\n   - Similar to report 4, with a securityRisk of 0.1.\n   - **Note:** Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable, considering the potential for data exposure via `to_dict()`, but this is standard error handling practice.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — the code is safe; potential data exposure via `to_dict()` is a standard concern, not an actual vulnerability here.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric          | Estimated Score |\n|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware         | 0               |\n| Obfuscated      | 0               |\n| Risk            | 0               |\n\n**Final note:** The code is a typical, safe exception class for API error handling. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is evident. The existing scores in the reports are aligned with this assessment.",
