{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling API errors related to TatrapayPlus, encapsulating different error body types.",
  "sources": "Error body parameter in the __init__ method, specifically error_body which can be of multiple imported types.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method calls to_dict() on error_body, which could potentially be exploited if to_dict() has malicious code.",
  "flows": "Error body is passed to the exception during instantiation, then __str__ is called, invoking to_dict() on error_body.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets observed. Usage of Union indicates flexible typing but is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class that stores an error body object, which can be of specific imported types. When converting to string, it calls to_dict() on error_body. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, malicious code injection, or backdoors. The design relies on the imported models' to_dict() method; unless these are malicious, the code appears safe. No suspicious data flows or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, well-structured exception class without any indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply wraps different error types and outputs their dictionary representation. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident.",
