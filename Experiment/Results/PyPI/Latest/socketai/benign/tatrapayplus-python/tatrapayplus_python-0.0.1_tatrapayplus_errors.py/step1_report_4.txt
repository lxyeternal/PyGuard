{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for handling API errors related to TatrapayPlus, encapsulating different error response types.",
  "sources": "Imports from tatrapayplus.models and the error_body parameter in the exception constructor.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method calls to_dict() on error_body, which could potentially process untrusted data if error_body is maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "error_body passed to the constructor → stored in self.error_body → __str__ method invokes to_dict() → string representation returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or external network calls present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward custom exception class. It accepts error data of specific types from the tatrapayplus.models module and relies on to_dict() method for string conversion. There are no evident data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The only potential concern is if error_body is maliciously crafted to cause side effects in to_dict(), but this is unlikely given typical data model design. No obfuscation or malware indicators are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, implementing a simple exception class for API error handling. It does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks.",
