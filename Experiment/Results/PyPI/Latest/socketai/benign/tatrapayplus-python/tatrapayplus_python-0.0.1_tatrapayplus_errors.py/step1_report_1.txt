{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling API error responses in the TatrapayPlus API client.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports modules and defines a class and method.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method calls to_dict() on the error_body object, which could potentially expose internal data if error_body contains sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no external data flows or untrusted data sources in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code structure is straightforward and typical for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception class that encapsulates different types of error bodies related to API responses. It imports specific models and uses type hints for error_body, calling to_dict() on it for string representation. There are no external input sources, no dynamic execution, or suspicious logic present. The code's purpose is to provide a structured exception for API errors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of a custom exception class for API error handling. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. It is well-structured and appears safe.",
