{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class `TatrapayPlusApiException` that encapsulates error responses from specific models, providing a string representation via `to_dict()`.",
  "sources": "The `error_body` parameter of types `GetAccessTokenResponse400`, `Field40XErrorBody`, or `Field400ErrorBody` imported from `tatrapayplus.models`.",
  "sinks": "The `to_dict()` method called within `__str__()`, which may expose internal data if `to_dict()` includes sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Error body is stored during initialization and converted to a string via `to_dict()` when the exception is printed or converted to string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation. The only potential concern is the use of `to_dict()`, which could expose sensitive data if improperly implemented, but this is standard in error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard pattern for encapsulating API error responses. It imports specific models, stores an error object, and provides a string representation by serializing the error object. No external inputs, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present. The reliance on `to_dict()` is typical but could pose a data exposure risk if the models contain sensitive info; however, this is generally acceptable in error reporting. The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security flaws. The potential security concern is minimal and depends on the implementation of `to_dict()`, which is outside this code's scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe exception class for API error handling. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The minor security risk score assigned in some reports (0.1) due to potential data exposure via `to_dict()` is justified but not indicative of actual vulnerability. Overall, the code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.",
