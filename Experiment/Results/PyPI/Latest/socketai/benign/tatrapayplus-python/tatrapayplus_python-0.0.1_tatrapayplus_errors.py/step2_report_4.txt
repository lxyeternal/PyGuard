  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Code Summary:**\n- Defines a custom exception class `TatrapayPlusApiException`.\n- The class takes an error body (of specific types) and stores it.\n- The `__str__` method returns the string representation of `error_body.to_dict()`.\n- No external inputs, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n- The code appears straightforward, standard for error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Confirmed as defining a custom exception class.\n- **Sources:** No external data, only imports and class definition.\n- **Sinks:** Calls `to_dict()` on `error_body`. Potential exposure if `to_dict()` includes sensitive info.\n- **Flows:** Internal data flow; no external data.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Standard pattern, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0, Obfuscated 0, Confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Sources:** `error_body` parameter of specific models.\n- **Sinks:** Calls `to_dict()`, possible data exposure.\n- **Flows:** Straightforward, no external untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Typical error class, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0, Obfuscated 0, Confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Sources:** Receives error models.\n- **Sinks:** Calls `to_dict()`.\n- **Flows:** Internal, no external data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Standard, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0, Obfuscated 0, Confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Sources:** Error body parameter.\n- **Sinks:** Calls `to_dict()`, potential data leak if `to_dict()` is malicious.\n- **Flows:** Data passed during instantiation, then string conversion.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Slightly more cautious, but still standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.1, Obfuscated 0, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Discussion:** The security risk score is set at 0.1, acknowledging a minimal potential if `to_dict()` is malicious. Given the code's simplicity and standard pattern, this seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Sources:** Error body parameter.\n- **Sinks:** Calls `to_dict()`.\n- **Flows:** Similar straightforward flow.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.1, Obfuscated 0, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Discussion:** Same reasoning as report 4; the small security risk score is appropriate given potential concerns about `to_dict()`.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Final Thoughts:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is simple, with no external data sources or dynamic code execution.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated at 0.1 in some reports, justified by the potential if `to_dict()` is malicious. However, given the context, this is a conservative and reasonable estimate.\n- **Scores consistency:** The scores align well with the analysis. The high confidence (1 or 0.9) is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** 0.05 — very low, only considering minimal risk if `to_dict()` is malicious, which is unlikely given typical data models.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe exception class with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is justified but could be slightly lowered to 0.05 for conservativeness.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect a cautious but justified assessment.",
