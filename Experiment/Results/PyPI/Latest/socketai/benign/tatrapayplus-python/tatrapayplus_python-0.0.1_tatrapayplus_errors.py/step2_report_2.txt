  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the code to verify the accuracy of their assessments and the scoring.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines `TatrapayPlusApiException`, a custom exception class.\n- Accepts an `error_body` parameter, which can be one of three imported models.\n- Stores `error_body` internally.\n- Implements `__str__()` which calls `to_dict()` on `error_body` and returns its string representation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and observations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  The code is straightforward, defining a custom exception class with no external data sources, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.  \n  The only potential concern is the use of `to_dict()` in `__str__()`, which could expose sensitive info if the models contain such data. But this is a common pattern in error reporting.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**  \n  No coding errors are apparent. The logic is simple and correct.  \n  The reliance on `to_dict()` is standard, but the security implications depend on the implementation of `to_dict()` in the models, which is outside this code.\n\n- **Scores justification:**  \n  - **malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)  \n  - **securityRisk:** 0 or very close (no evident security flaws; potential data leak depends on models, but no direct evidence)  \n  - **obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n  - **risk:** 0.5 or below (standard error handling class)\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Well-structured, no malicious behavior, standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (or 0)\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard pattern, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The potential for data exposure is acknowledged but is standard.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Straightforward, no suspicious code, standard error encapsulation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Slightly more cautious, mentions potential exposure if `to_dict()` is malicious, but unlikely.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. Slightly elevated securityRisk score due to potential data leak if `to_dict()` is malicious, but unlikely.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, no suspicious patterns, standard error class.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The minor securityRisk score reflects cautiousness about the `to_dict()` method.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports; no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as code is clear.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated (0.1) in some reports due to the potential for data exposure via `to_dict()`, but this is a standard pattern, not malicious.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (due to potential data exposure, but not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment that the code is standard, with minimal security risk primarily due to the use of `to_dict()`. The scores assigned are reasonable, though a conservative approach would keep malware at 0 and risk at about 0.1, reflecting the potential for data exposure but not malicious intent.\n\n**Final note:**  \nNo changes needed; the code is safe, and the reports correctly identify its benign nature with minor caution about data exposure.",
