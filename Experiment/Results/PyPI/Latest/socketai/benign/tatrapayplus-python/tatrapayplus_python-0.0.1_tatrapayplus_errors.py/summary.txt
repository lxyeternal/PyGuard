  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe exception class for API error handling. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The minor security risk score assigned in some reports (0.1) due to potential data exposure via `to_dict()` is justified but not indicative of actual vulnerability. Overall, the code is benign, and the scores are appropriate."
