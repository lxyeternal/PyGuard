  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code and the provided assessments.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is purely static configuration and enumeration definitions.\n- No dynamic code execution, input handling, or network requests are present.\n- URLs and enum values are straightforward, with no embedded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n- No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are identified.\n\n**Specific Review:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is simple enums and constants.\n- No anomalies or malicious intent.\n- Malware score: 0 — justified.\n- Risk score: 0 — appropriate, as no security concern exists.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on benign static definitions.\n- Malware score: 0 — justified.\n- Risk score: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion: configuration constants, no processing or input.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Focuses on static configuration for API interaction.\n- No malicious indicators.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Reiterates the benign nature of static enum and URL definitions.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- The code in question is a straightforward configuration module with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk score should also be 0, given the static nature and absence of dynamic or sensitive data handling.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe configuration module defining enums and constants for a payment API. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present. The existing assessments are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI concur with the provided reports. The code is benign, with scores appropriately set to zero across malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
