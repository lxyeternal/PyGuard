{
  "purpose": "Define enumerations and constants related to payment processing URLs and statuses for a payment system integration.",
  "sources": "Constants and enum values are hardcoded; no external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network requests, or untrusted data handling are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks are observed; the code mainly defines static values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The URL constants are straightforward and do not contain hidden or malicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of enum definitions for 'Scope', 'SimpleStatus', and 'Mode', and a class 'Urls' containing static URL constants. These are standard pattern definitions for a payment API client. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive data handling present. The URLs are clearly defined as constants without any embedded secrets or suspicious logic. The code appears to be part of a larger system but, in isolation, shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration and enumeration setup for a payment system API. There are no malicious behaviors, no security risks, and no obfuscated or suspicious code elements detected. It is safe as-is.",
