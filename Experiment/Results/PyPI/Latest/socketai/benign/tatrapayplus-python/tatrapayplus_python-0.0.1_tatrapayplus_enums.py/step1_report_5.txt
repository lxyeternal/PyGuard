{
  "purpose": "Define enumerations and constants related to the TATRAPAYPLUS payment system, including environment URLs and transaction statuses.",
  "sources": "No input sources; all data are constants and enums defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines static constants and enums.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code contains straightforward enum and constant definitions with no unusual constructs or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enums for scope, status, and mode, and a class containing static URL constants for sandbox and production environments. It does not perform any data input, output, or processing that could lead to security concerns. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration-like module that specifies constants and enums related to a payment API. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data processing, and no security risks.",
