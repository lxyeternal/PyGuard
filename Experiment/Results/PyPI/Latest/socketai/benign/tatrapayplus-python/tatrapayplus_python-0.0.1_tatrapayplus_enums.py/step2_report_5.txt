  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the code content with the claims made.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code consists solely of enum classes (`Scope`, `SimpleStatus`, `Mode`) and a class `Urls` with static URL constants.\n- There are no functions, input/output handling, or dynamic code execution.\n- The URLs are hardcoded, straightforward, and do not contain embedded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n- No data flow from external sources, no network requests, no untrusted data handling.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n\n**1. Are the reported issues present?**\n- All reports claim the code is benign, with no malicious behaviors, no obfuscation, and no security risks.\n- This aligns with the code content, which is purely static configuration.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning?**\n- The reports are consistent; they correctly identify that the code is static, straightforward, and safe.\n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n**3. Are the scores assigned reasonable?**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0.\n- This is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5?**\n- None of the reports suggest any reason to assign higher scores; all are consistent with a score of 0.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions?**\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report content?**\n- Yes, all are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — static configuration with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\nGiven the code and the reports, I concur with the assessments. The code is purely static configuration data defining enums and constants for API URLs and statuses. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code content.",
