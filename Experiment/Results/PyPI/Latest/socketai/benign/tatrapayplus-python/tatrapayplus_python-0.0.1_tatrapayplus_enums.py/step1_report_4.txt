  "purpose": "Define enums and constants for interacting with the TATRAPAYPLUS API, including environment URLs and status modes.",
  "sources": "Constants and enum values hardcoded within the class and variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no data processing or external input handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines static constants and enums.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The URL endpoints are static strings, and enums are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static configuration data for API interaction, including URLs and status enums. It lacks functions, input handling, or data processing. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The URL constants are fixed, and enum values are standard. There are no suspicious or malicious elements present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module defining constants and enums for API interaction. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
