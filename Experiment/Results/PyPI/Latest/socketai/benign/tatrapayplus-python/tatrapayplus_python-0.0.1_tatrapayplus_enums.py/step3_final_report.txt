  "purpose": "Defines enums and constants for API URLs and statuses related to a payment system.",
  "sources": "Static class variables and enum string values",
  "sinks": "None; no data input or output handling present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static data with no data flow",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static definitions with no suspicious or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static enum classes and URL constants, with no dynamic code, input handling, or network requests. The URL strings are straightforward, with no embedded secrets or malicious payloads. Enums are simple string values. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected. The code's structure and content are typical for configuration modules, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration module defining enums and constants for a payment API. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.",
