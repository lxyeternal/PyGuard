  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static definitions of enums and constants related to URLs and statuses for a payment API.\n- No external data input, dynamic code, or network requests are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are identified.\n- The code appears to be a configuration module, with straightforward, static values.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n**1. Report 1:**\n- Confirms no malicious behavior, no hidden elements.\n- The reasoning is sound; static enums and constants are standard.\n- **Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 is not assigned, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**2. Report 2:**\n- Similar conclusions; no external data, no suspicious code.\n- The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, matching the benign assessment.\n- **Risk score:** 0, appropriate.\n\n**3. Report 3:**\n- Same pattern; static definitions, no processing.\n- No anomalies or suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n\n**4. Report 4:**\n- Same as above; static configuration data.\n- No malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** All zeros.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n\n**5. Report 5:**\n- Also consistent; static enums and URL constants.\n- No dynamic or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** All zeros.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is purely static configuration with no security concerns, a score of 0 is appropriate for all.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed; the analysis aligns with the code's nature.",
