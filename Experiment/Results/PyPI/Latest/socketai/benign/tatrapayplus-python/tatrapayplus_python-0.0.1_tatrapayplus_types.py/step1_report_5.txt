{
  "purpose": "Defines shared data structures for property management, including file handling and HTTP response representation.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, class constructors, property initializations, method definitions, and module-level constants.",
  "sinks": "Method to_tuple() returns data in a format suitable for HTTP multipart upload; response class holds HTTP response data; no external sinks involve untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes through to methods like to_tuple(), with no evident untrusted input processing or external data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up data structures using attrs for file uploads and HTTP responses. The Unset class provides a singleton for unset values. The code appears straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or insecure data handling. It is purely data structure definitions with standard library and attrs usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data modeling module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a foundation for other components that may handle untrusted data but does not itself introduce any security concerns.",
