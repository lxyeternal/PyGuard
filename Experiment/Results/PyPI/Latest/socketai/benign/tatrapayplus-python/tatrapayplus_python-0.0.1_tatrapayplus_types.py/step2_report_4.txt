  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation & Content**:\n   - The code defines data classes (`File`, `Response`) and a singleton (`Unset`) using attrs.\n   - It includes type annotations and constants, with no logic beyond data encapsulation.\n   - No input validation, no data processing, no network or file I/O within this snippet.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior**:\n   - The code appears to be a utility module for handling HTTP responses and file uploads.\n   - The `to_tuple()` method prepares data for multipart/form-data, which is standard.\n   - The `Response` class is a generic container for HTTP responses, not performing any processing.\n   - The `Unset` class is a singleton for optional unset values, common in API clients.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports**:\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious intent.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1.0).\n   - Malware scores are 0 in all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Security risks are minimal (mostly 0.0 or 0.1), reflecting the non-intrusive nature of the code.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - The malware scores are correctly set to 0, as there's no malicious code.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n   - The overall risk scores are very low, which aligns with the code's purpose and content.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:\n   - No issues detected in the code logic.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious.\n   - No need to adjust scores based on the provided information.\n\n6. **Final Assessment & Recommendations**:\n   - The code is a standard data model module with no security concerns.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n   - No further action needed.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score**: 0.1 or 0.0 (current scores are reasonable)\n\n**Final recommendation**: The current scores are justified and accurate based on the code and reports. No changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: Always remain vigilant for indirect vulnerabilities or misuse in larger contexts, but within this snippet, the security posture is sound.",
