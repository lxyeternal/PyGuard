{
  "purpose": "Defines shared data types and classes for property handling, including file uploads and HTTP responses.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters such as 'payload', 'file_name', 'mime_type', and 'headers'.",
  "sinks": "None of the data directly flows into sensitive sinks like network transmission, file writing, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data from class attributes (e.g., 'payload', 'headers') could potentially flow to external systems if used elsewhere, but not in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious variable names, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data classes using attrs for handling files and responses. It includes a generic Response class for API responses, with no logic that processes or transmits data internally. No input validation or unsafe data handling appears in this fragment. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity is present. The code is straightforward and appears to serve as a utility module for other parts of a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data definition module for handling files and HTTP responses, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this fragment.",
