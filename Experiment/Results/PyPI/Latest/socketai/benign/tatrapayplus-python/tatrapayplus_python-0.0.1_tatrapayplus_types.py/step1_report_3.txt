{
  "purpose": "Defines shared types and data structures for handling files and responses in a Python application, including type annotations and utility classes.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data sources directly.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes to external systems or performs unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard library features and third-party attrs library without any obfuscated or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, malicious backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for managing file uploads (File) and HTTP responses (Response), along with a utility Unset class and a constant UNSET. All components use standard libraries or well-known third-party packages (attrs). No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks are present. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code injections. The code structure is straightforward, primarily focused on data encapsulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a safe, standard implementation of data models for handling HTTP responses and file uploads. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
