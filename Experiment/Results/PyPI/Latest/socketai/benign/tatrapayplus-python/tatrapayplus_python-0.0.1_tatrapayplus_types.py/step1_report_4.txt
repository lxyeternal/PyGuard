{
  "purpose": "Shared types and data structures for properties, particularly for file uploads and HTTP responses.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; defines classes and constants used internally or for API interactions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or handling of untrusted data, no network or storage operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to object instantiations and method returns within the module.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code or backdoors, no obfuscation, no unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes and constants, such as Unset, File, and Response, used for managing HTTP interactions and file uploads. It employs type annotations and attrs for class definitions. There are no external input sources, no network operations, no data leaks, or code injection points. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a straightforward, utility-oriented module intended for internal use in larger projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, mainly providing data structures and constants for HTTP and file handling without any malicious intent or security risks.",
