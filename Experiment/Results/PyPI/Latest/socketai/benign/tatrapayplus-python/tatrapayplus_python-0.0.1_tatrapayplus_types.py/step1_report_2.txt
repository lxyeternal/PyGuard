{
  "purpose": "Define shared types and classes for handling file uploads and HTTP responses in a Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules, class attributes, and constant definitions. No external user input or untrusted data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows into security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily defines data structures and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs are evident. The class and type definitions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for 'Unset', 'File', and 'Response' with associated attributes and methods, along with type aliases and constants. No input handling, no dynamic code execution, nor network operations are included. The usage of 'attrs' library is for clean class definitions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. All components are standard data structures for API communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining data types and constants for use elsewhere. It shows no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It can be considered safe with a high confidence level.",
