{
  "purpose": "Defines shared types and data structures for file uploads and HTTP responses in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and methods accessing class attributes (e.g., 'payload', 'file_name', 'mime_type', 'status_code', 'headers', 'content', 'parsed')",
  "sinks": "None present; code does not process untrusted input or output data directly",
  "flows": "Data is stored in class instances; no data flows into external systems or insecure sinks within this code fragment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward data modeling with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes using attrs for file upload info ('File'), HTTP response ('Response'), and a singleton for unset values ('Unset'). It contains no dynamic code, network calls, or input validation. The code is purely structural, serving as utility data containers. No malicious or insecure behaviors are present, and the code does not perform any operations that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and free of malicious intent or security flaws. It functions as a utility module for data modeling, with no signs of sabotage, obfuscation, or security risks.",
