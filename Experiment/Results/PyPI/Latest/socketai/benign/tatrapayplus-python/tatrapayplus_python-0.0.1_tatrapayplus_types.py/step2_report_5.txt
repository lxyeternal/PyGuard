  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines shared data types for file uploads and responses, with no processing or transmission.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious code. It is a straightforward utility module.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low, justified by minimal risk), confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No issues; the low security risk score seems appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing data structure definitions without external data handling.\n- **Findings:** No vulnerabilities, no external input, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.0.\n- **Assessment:** Completely benign. The zero risk score aligns well.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Defines data models for files and responses, with no dynamic or unsafe code.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully safe and standard.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with no external input or suspicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Data structures for file uploads and responses, with no dynamic or unsafe operations.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score due to minimal concern, but still very low.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code being purely data definitions with no executable or network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code is straightforward, so no obfuscation concerns.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low across all reports, justified by the absence of dynamic code, external input handling, or insecure operations.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a set of data classes and constants, serving as utility models for file uploads and HTTP responses.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The minimal risk scores are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (a tiny margin to reflect the very minimal inherent risk, but still negligible)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, safe, and standard for its purpose. The existing scores are reasonable and justified.",
