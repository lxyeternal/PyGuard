  "purpose": "The script organizes and relocates specific Python files from a generated client directory to a main project directory, then cleans up the generated client folder.",
  "sources": "Path definitions and file existence checks for 'types.py' and model files; uses glob to locate model files; reads directory contents to move files.",
  "sinks": "shutil.move() for relocating files; shutil.rmtree() for deleting directories.",
  "flows": "Source: Path checks and directory listings; sink: moving files and deleting directories.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious commands, or unusual code behavior. Operations are straightforward file manipulations. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up directory paths, checks for the existence of specific files, moves them to designated locations, and deletes a directory. All actions are standard filesystem operations without user input, network communication, or sensitive data handling. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The process appears as a typical file organization and cleanup script.",
  "conclusion": "This script performs standard file management tasks with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities based on the provided code.",
