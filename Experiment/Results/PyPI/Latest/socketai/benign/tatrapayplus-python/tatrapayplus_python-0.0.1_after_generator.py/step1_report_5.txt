  "purpose": "Organizing and relocating generated Python model files and types.py within a project directory structure.",
  "sources": "Reads from the generated client directory and models directory, checks for existence of types.py, and directory contents.",
  "sinks": "File system operations such as shutil.move and shutil.rmtree which modify or delete files/directories.",
  "flows": "Reads from 'generated' directories -> moves files to target directories -> deletes the generated client folder.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. File operations are standard, no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script moves 'types.py' from a generated client directory to the root directory, then moves all Python files from the 'models' subdirectory to a designated models directory. It then deletes the entire generated client folder. All operations are standard file system manipulations with no input from untrusted sources or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed, and the code does not perform network operations or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs routine file organization tasks without any signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is safe and solely manages project files.",
