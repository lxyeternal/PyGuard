{
  "purpose": "The code defines a data class 'Amount' for representing monetary amounts with currency codes, including serialization and deserialization methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from dictionaries in the from_dict method, and user-defined attributes via additional_properties.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources or execute untrusted input beyond dictionary manipulation; no direct data leaks or external effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionary to class instance in from_dict, and from class instance to dictionary in to_dict, with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. Use of attrs library is standard. No external calls or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The class provides straightforward serialization/deserialization for monetary amounts with currency codes. The methods operate solely on in-memory data structures. There is no code that reads from or writes to external systems, nor any suspicious dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior is observed. The code appears to be a typical data container implementation with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a data class for handling monetary amounts, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use.",
