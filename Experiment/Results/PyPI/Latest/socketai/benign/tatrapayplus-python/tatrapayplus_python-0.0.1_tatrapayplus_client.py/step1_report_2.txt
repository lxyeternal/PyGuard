{
  "purpose": "The code implements a client for interacting with the TatrapayPlus API, including authentication, payment processing, and appearance customization.",
  "sources": "Reads include environment variables, public key files, and response data from API calls. Data is read from local files and API responses.",
  "sinks": "API requests with sensitive data such as tokens, payment details, and cryptographic operations. Also writes logs if a logger is provided.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data (credentials, tokens, payment info) flow from input sources into API request payloads and cryptographic functions. Data from responses may be logged.",
  "anomalies": "The generate_signed_card_id_from_cid method reads a public key from a local file and performs encryption; it properly handles errors. No hardcoded secrets are detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement standard API client behaviors with proper handling of tokens, retries, and responses. Cryptographic operations are standard RSA encryption with OAEP padding, and the public key is read from a file. Error handling is present. No suspicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious network activity, or privacy violations. The code structure and flow align with typical secure API client implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical API client implementation with cryptographic support for generating signed card IDs. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malicious obfuscation, or supply chain threats. The cryptographic operations are standard, and no suspicious data flows are present. Overall, the code appears secure and legitimate.",
