  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a client for TatrapayPlus API, handling auth, payments, cryptography, with standard practices. No malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, minor concern about print statements in error handling.\n\n- **Assessment:** The cryptographic operation (RSA encryption with OAEP) is standard. The logging of responses could leak sensitive info if logs are stored insecurely, but this is a common concern rather than a malicious one.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These seem reasonable.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No issues warranting higher scores. The minor concern about print statements is acknowledged but not critical.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, confirms standard cryptography, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The RSA encryption process with a public key loaded from a file is standard. No suspicious data flows or backdoors.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. These are appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates standard API client behavior, cryptography with RSA, no hardcoded secrets, minor concern about error print statements.\n\n- **Assessment:** The use of print statements in cryptographic error handling is not ideal but not malicious. No suspicious network activity or backdoors.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These are consistent.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a typical API client, cryptography is standard, no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on cryptographic function encrypting card IDs with RSA, loading public key from a file, standard practices, no obfuscation or malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The RSA encryption process is standard. No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate cryptographic operation, no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard API client, loads public key from a file, performs RSA encryption, no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** RSA encryption with key from a file is standard. No suspicious network activity or data leaks.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Reasonable.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Secure, standard implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports find evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage. The cryptographic functions are standard, and no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present.\n\n- **Errors or flaws:** Minor concerns about the use of print statements for error handling in cryptography, which could leak info if logs are insecure. However, this is not malicious.\n\n- **Scores consistency:** All scores are reasonable given the findings. Malware scores are zero, reflecting no malicious activity.\n\n- **Potential improvements:** Replace print statements with proper logging and error handling, but this does not impact security directly.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n**Based on all reports, I would assign the following scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (minor concern about error handling, but overall low risk)\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard, well-structured API client with cryptographic operations that follow best practices. No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or backdoors. The only concern is the use of print statements for error reporting, which could be improved for production security but does not constitute a security risk or malware.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** I agree with the assessments provided in the reports. The code appears legitimate and secure, with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code.",
