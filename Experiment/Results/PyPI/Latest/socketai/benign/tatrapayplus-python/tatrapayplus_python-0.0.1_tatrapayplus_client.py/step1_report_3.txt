  "purpose": "This code implements a client for interacting with the TatrapayPlus API, handling authentication, payments, and appearance customization.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for API keys and secret (assumed), reads public key file for encryption, makes network requests to API endpoints, reads response JSON data.",
  "sinks": "Network requests (POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE), JSON response handling, reading public key file, encryption function, logging output.",
  "flows": "API credentials and tokens are fetched and used for authenticated requests; sensitive data like access tokens are included in headers; encryption process reads a public key from disk and encrypts data; response data is processed and potentially logged.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for error handling in cryptographic functions, which can leak error details; no hardcoded credentials observed, but sensitive info is fetched from files and environment variables; encryption function performs RSA encryption with no obvious misuse but potential for misconfiguration exists; no suspicious network domain connections or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard API client implementation with appropriate use of security libraries for RSA encryption. It reads a public key from a file and encrypts data, which is a typical cryptographic operation. Network requests are handled via requests.Session with retries, and error handling uses exceptions and custom exceptions. The presence of print statements in the encryption method is a minor concern but not malicious. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity detected. The overall design appears consistent with legitimate API client code, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical API client with cryptographic operations and network interactions. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected. Minor concerns about error logging methods, but overall security posture appears acceptable. No signs of malware or malicious data leaks.",
