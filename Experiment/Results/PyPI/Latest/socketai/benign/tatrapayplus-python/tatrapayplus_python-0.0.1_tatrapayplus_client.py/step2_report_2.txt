  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate API client for TatrapayPlus, with proper cryptography, token management, and error handling. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected. Minor concern about print statements in error handling, but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The only minor concern is the use of print statements for error reporting instead of secure logging, which could leak info if logs are exposed, but this is not malicious.\n\n- **Verdict:** The score aligns with the analysis. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard API client with cryptography, no signs of malicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, standard RSA encryption.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** Well-reasoned. No suspicious behaviors or vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard API client, reads environment variables and public key files, cryptographic operations are standard RSA encryption, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. Minor concern about error handling with print statements, but not malicious.\n\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements an API client with RSA encryption of card IDs, reads public key from file, no suspicious activity, standard cryptography.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Well justified. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Verdict:** Valid scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard API client, reads public key from file, cryptography is standard, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** Reasoning is consistent.\n\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage. Cryptography is standard RSA with OAEP padding, reading keys from files, which is typical.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** The reports correctly identify the cryptographic operations and API interactions as standard and legitimate.\n\n- **Scores consistency:** All scores are low, reflecting no malware, obfuscation, or high security risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Potential concerns:** Minor logging issues (print statements) are noted but do not constitute security risks or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0** — no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk score:** Given the minor logging concerns and standard cryptography, a risk score of **0.1–0.2** seems appropriate.\n\n**Considering all reports and their analyses, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese scores reflect a benign, well-implemented API client with standard cryptography and no signs of malicious intent.",
