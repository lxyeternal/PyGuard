{
  "purpose": "This code implements a client for the TatrapayPlus API, handling authentication, payment processing, cryptographic operations, and configuration management.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from API responses, request objects, and public key files; reads environment variables and configuration files for cryptographic keys.",
  "sinks": "Potentially leaks sensitive data through logging (print statements), encrypts card IDs with RSA, and communicates over network via HTTP requests.",
  "flows": "Source data (public key, request data) flows into cryptographic functions and API request payloads; responses flow into error handling and response parsing; cryptographic output (encrypted card ID) is returned as a formatted string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for error reporting in cryptographic functions; loading public key from a file; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; standard cryptography practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client with cryptographic operations (RSA encryption with OAEP padding), token management, and network communication. No malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage are evident. Minor concerns include the use of print statements for error handling, which could leak sensitive info if logs are insecure, but this is a common development practice rather than malicious. The cryptography and request handling follow best practices, and no suspicious data flows or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client implementing standard cryptographic and network communication practices. There is no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The minor logging concerns do not elevate the security risk significantly.",
