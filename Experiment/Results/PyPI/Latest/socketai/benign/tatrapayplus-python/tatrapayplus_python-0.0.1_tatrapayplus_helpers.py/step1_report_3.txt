{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for handling payment statuses, card type identification, sensitive data masking, and logging within a payment processing system.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function parameters such as 'payment_status', 'body', 'headers', and 'response' objects, which may contain untrusted data, especially from HTTP requests and responses.",
  "sinks": "Sinks include the logging functions that output data via 'write_line', the JSON serialization, and the masking functions that process potentially sensitive data before logging or output.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., payment status objects, request bodies, headers, responses) through masking functions or status evaluation functions, then to logging functions where data is formatted and output, with masking applied to sensitive fields.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The only notable aspect is the masking of sensitive data in logs, which is standard practice. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles payment status interpretation, card type identification, sensitive data masking, and logging. It includes functions to identify card types based on number prefixes, categorize payment statuses, extract saved card data, and mask sensitive information such as client secrets and authorization headers. The logging class is designed to anonymize sensitive data before output. No code indicates malicious intent such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or system damage. The data masking methods prevent exposure of secrets in logs, which is a security best practice. Overall, the code appears to serve legitimate purposes related to payment processing and logging with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code functions as part of a payment processing system, providing status evaluation, card identification, and secure logging. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage, focusing instead on data security and status management. The overall security risk is low, and there are no indications of malware or malicious intent.",
