  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling payment statuses, identifying card types, sanitizing data, and logging request/response details with masking of sensitive information.",
  "sources": "Input data from payment status objects, card number strings, request bodies, and headers.",
  "sinks": "Masked data in logs, JSON serialization, and potential exposure of sensitive info if masking fails.",
  "flows": "Input data (payment status, card number, request/response) → processing functions (status mapping, card detection, sanitization) → masked logs and data outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or obfuscation detected; the only notable aspect is the abstract 'write_line' method, which is a common pattern and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard payment processing utilities with proper data masking and sanitization practices. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The functions are straightforward, and the design pattern of an abstract logger is typical. The masking functions prevent data leaks, and the status handling aligns with expected payment workflows. No external network calls or code injection points are evident. The confidence in benign intent is high (0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, security-conscious utility module for payment processing. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score (~0.2) is justified given its functions. Overall, it is safe for use.",
