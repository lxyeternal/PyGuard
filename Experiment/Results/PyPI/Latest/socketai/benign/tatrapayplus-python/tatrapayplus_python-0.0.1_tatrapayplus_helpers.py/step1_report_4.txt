{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for payment card identification, status handling, data sanitization, and logging in a payment processing context.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input parameters such as payment status objects, card numbers, and request/response objects in the logger.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include logging functions that output request and response data, and functions that handle payment status, which could leak sensitive information if misused.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (payment statuses, card numbers, request/response objects) through processing functions that identify card types, statuses, sanitize data, and mask sensitive information, finally reaching the logging functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials are found. The code masks sensitive data before logging, which is a good practice. The only potential concern is the mask_value method, which masks string values but might be misused if external code improperly calls it; however, this does not indicate malicious intent. The code does not contain obfuscated or hidden malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for payment processing: identifying card types, mapping statuses to simplified states, sanitizing input strings, and logging. It uses well-structured, transparent logic with no suspicious network calls, no code injection, and no hidden data exfiltration mechanisms. The logger masks sensitive information effectively. No anomalies or malicious patterns are evident. The code's purpose aligns with typical payment processing utilities, with secure handling of sensitive data during logging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, security-conscious utility module for handling payment status and logging. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the analysis. It employs masking for sensitive data and straightforward logic, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
