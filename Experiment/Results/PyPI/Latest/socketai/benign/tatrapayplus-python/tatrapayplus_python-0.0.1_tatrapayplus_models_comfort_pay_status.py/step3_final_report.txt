  "purpose": "Define a string-based enumeration for payment status with two states: FAIL and OK.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; static enum members.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the enum is static and used for status representation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard enum usage and an override of __str__.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple enum class inheriting from str and Enum, with two members 'FAIL' and 'OK'. It overrides __str__ to return the string value, which is standard. No external data, input/output, or dynamic behavior is present. The code is static, clear, and free of obfuscation or malicious constructs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. No vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or suspicious behavior are detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard enum class with no security issues or malicious behavior. The provided reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
