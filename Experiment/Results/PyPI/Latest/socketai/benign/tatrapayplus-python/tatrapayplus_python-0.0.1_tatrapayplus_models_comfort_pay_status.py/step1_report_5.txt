  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for representing payment status with string values",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not output or handle untrusted data",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows are present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward enum definition with no suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class 'ComfortPayStatus' inheriting from str and Enum, with two members: FAIL and OK. It includes a custom __str__ method returning the string value of the enum. There are no external data sources, no input handling, no untrusted data processing, and no complex or suspicious code constructs. The code is a simple, standard enum definition with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign enumeration definition with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not perform any harmful actions or handle sensitive data improperly.",
