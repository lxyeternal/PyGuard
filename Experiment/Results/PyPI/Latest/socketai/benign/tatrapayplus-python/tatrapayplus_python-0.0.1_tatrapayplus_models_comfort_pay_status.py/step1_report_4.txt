{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for payment status with string values.",
  "sources": "No input or external data read; the code defines a class and constants.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions; no untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks as there are no input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard use of Enum and class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'ComfortPayStatus' inheriting from str and Enum, with two members 'FAIL' and 'OK'. It includes a __str__ method overriding the default string representation to return the enum's value. The code appears to be a straightforward enumeration definition with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. There are no hardcoded credentials, external calls, or any behavior indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign enumeration for payment statuses. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks are present.",
