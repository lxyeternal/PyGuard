  "purpose": "Define an enumeration class for representing payment status with string values.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data to external systems or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward enum definition with a custom __str__ method.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Enum from the enum module and defines a subclass ComfortPayStatus inheriting from str and Enum. It includes two members, FAIL and OK, with string values. The __str__ method returns the string value of the enum instance, which is standard for readable enum representations. No input, output, or external data handling is present. The structure is simple and conventional, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic, safe enumeration definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a simple data structure for payment status and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
