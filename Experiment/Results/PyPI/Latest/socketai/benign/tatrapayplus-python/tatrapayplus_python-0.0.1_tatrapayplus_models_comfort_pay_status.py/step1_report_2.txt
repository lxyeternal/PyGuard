  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for ComfortPay status with string values.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code only defines a class and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class and defines a subclass ComfortPayStatus inheriting from str and Enum, with two members FAIL and OK. The __str__ method is overridden to return the string value of the enum member, which is standard for string enums. No external inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution are present. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code appears to be a typical enum definition used for status representation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard enum declaration for status representation with no malicious intent or security issues.",
