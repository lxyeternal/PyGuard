  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for representing the status of ComfortPay transactions.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data output or data handling functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only defines an enum class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python enum class inheriting from str, used to represent two status values 'FAIL' and 'OK'. It includes a __str__ method override for string representation of enum members. There are no input, output, or external data handling mechanisms. The structure and content are typical for an enum definition with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign enumeration definition with no malicious intent or security issues identified.",
