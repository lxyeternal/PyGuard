{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class 'PayLaterStatus' representing various statuses related to a payment or loan process.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code defines a class with hardcoded string values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not perform any data output, network communication, or sensitive operation.",
  "flows": "No data flows from input to output; the class simply provides enumerated string constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and conventional for enum definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a subclass of Enum for specific status values, including a __str__ method override for string representation. No external inputs, outputs, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is simple and uses standard enum patterns without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard enum definition with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign, purposeful enumeration class.",
