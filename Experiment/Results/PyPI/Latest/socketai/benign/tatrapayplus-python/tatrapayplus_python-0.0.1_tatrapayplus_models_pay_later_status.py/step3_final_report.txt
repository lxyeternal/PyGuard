  "purpose": "Defines a set of string constants representing various statuses in a payment or loan process for use within a larger application.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data reads, or data sources; static enum definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, outputs, or external interactions; purely declarative.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static enum members used internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of str and Enum with several status constants. It includes a __str__ method returning the enum's value, facilitating string representation. The code is static, with no external data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero. The code does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. No anomalies or issues are present that would warrant concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward enum class representing status constants. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
