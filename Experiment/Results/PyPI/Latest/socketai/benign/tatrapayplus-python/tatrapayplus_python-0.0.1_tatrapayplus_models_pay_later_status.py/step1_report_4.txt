  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for PayLater status states with string representation",
  "sources": "No external input or data read",
  "sinks": "No data output or external data writing",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output or between functions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, and the code is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class, defines a string Enum with several status values related to a payment or loan process, and overrides __str__ for string representation. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks that could leak data or execute malicious actions, and no complex flows. The code appears to be a simple, standard Enum definition without any obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard implementation of an Enum for representing pay-later statuses. It contains no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
