  "purpose": "Define an enumeration class for various statuses related to a 'Pay Later' feature.",
  "sources": "No input sources; code defines static class and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; class and constants are static and not used in any data processing within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard enum implementation with no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple enumeration class inheriting from str and Enum, defining status constants for a payment feature. It includes a custom __str__ method that returns the value of the enum member. There are no external data inputs, no data outputs, and no side effects or external calls. No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward enumeration definition with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a normal, safe part of a larger application.",
