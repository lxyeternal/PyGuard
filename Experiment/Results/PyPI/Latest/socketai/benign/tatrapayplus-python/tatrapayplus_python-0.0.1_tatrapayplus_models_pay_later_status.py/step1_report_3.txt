  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for various PayLater statuses as a subclass of str and Enum.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs involving untrusted data; the code only defines constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum subclass with string values representing different statuses. It includes a custom __str__ method to return the value as a string. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations. The code appears to be a standard enumeration definition with no external interactions or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward enumeration class with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines status constants for use elsewhere.",
