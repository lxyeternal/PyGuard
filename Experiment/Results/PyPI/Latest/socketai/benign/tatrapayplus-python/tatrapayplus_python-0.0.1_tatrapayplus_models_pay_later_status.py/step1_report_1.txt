  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class 'PayLaterStatus' to represent various statuses related to a payment or loan process.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code defines a class and constants.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow or data manipulation occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed. The __str__ method explicitly returns the string value of the enum, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple Enum subclass with string values representing different payment statuses. It includes a custom __str__ method that returns the string value of the enum, which is a common pattern to facilitate string representation. There are no external inputs, data processing, or side effects. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Enum class defining status constants without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
