{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python package designed to perform specific functionality, potentially related to data processing or utility operations, based on the observed function definitions and imports.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly external resources such as files or network requests if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or printing/logging outputs that could leak data or cause effects based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources like function parameters or environment variables through processing functions, potentially reaching output statements or network/file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or sensitive information were observed. No obfuscated code, misleading variable names, or unusual language features detected. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard function definitions and imports, with no evidence of malicious code such as network exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. There are no suspicious patterns like dynamic execution or hidden behaviors. The structure is straightforward, with clear data flow and no anomalies suggesting malicious intent. The code does not handle or process untrusted input in insecure ways, nor does it perform dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malware or malicious activity. It is a standard implementation without suspicious behaviors. The security risk is low, and the likelihood of malicious intent is minimal.",
