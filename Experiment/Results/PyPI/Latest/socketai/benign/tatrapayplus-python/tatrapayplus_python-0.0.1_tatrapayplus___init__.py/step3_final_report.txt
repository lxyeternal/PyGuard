{
  "purpose": "This code is a Python package containing functions and imports, likely intended for general utility or application-specific tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters and possibly external modules via imports.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through functions; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard function definitions and imports, with no suspicious or malicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The structure is straightforward, and no external communication or data leakage mechanisms are evident. Given the lack of suspicious patterns, the code appears benign. The confidence in this assessment is high, and no malicious or obfuscating features are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. It poses a low security risk and does not contain malware. The overall threat level is minimal based on the provided code snippet.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
