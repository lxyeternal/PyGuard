  "purpose": "Function to determine if a given number is odd",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' (assumed to be provided at runtime)",
  "sinks": "Return statement (output of the function)",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows into the modulo operation, then the result is used in a comparison, ultimately returning a boolean value",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function to check if a number is odd by using modulo operation. It only performs a basic arithmetic comparison, with no external data sources, environment variables, or network activity. The function is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless function for checking odd numbers with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
