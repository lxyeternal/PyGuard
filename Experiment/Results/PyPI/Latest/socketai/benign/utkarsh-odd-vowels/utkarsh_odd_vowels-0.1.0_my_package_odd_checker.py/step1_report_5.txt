  "purpose": "The function checks whether a given number is odd.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the result of the modulo operation.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly into the modulo operation, then the result is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code constructs observed. The code is straightforward and uses standard Python syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function that takes a number and returns whether it is odd by checking if the number modulo 2 is not zero. There are no hardcoded credentials, no external data reads, and no unsafe operations. The code performs a basic arithmetic check without side effects or hidden behaviors. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function to determine odd numbers with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
