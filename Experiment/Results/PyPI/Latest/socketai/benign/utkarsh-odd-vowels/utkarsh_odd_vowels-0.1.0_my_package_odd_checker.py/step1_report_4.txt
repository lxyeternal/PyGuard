  "purpose": "Determine whether a given number is odd",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' passed to the function",
  "sinks": "Return statement indicating the result of the check",
  "flows": "Input 'number' is processed and the result is returned directly",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code performs a straightforward mathematical check",
  "analysis": "The function simply checks if the input 'number' modulo 2 is not equal to zero, which is a standard way to determine if a number is odd. The code is minimal, clear, and free of any obfuscated or suspicious constructs. There are no hardcoded credentials, external data reads, or side effects present. The structure and content are typical for a simple utility function.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic, benign check for odd numbers with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
