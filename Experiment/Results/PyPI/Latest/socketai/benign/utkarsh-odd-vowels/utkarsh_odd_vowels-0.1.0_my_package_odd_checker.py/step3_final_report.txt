{
  "purpose": "A simple utility function to check if a number is odd.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' received by the function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external data sinks; the function performs a basic arithmetic operation.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly into the modulo operation, resulting in a boolean output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an odd number check using modulo. All reports confirm its simplicity, correctness, and benign nature. No external dependencies, no suspicious patterns, and no obfuscation are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the analysis. Given the lack of any malicious or risky behavior, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility function with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and consistent, and the scores reflect a very low risk profile.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
