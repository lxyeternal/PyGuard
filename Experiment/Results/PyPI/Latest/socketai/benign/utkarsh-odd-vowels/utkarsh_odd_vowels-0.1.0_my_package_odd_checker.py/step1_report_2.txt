  "purpose": "Function to determine if a given number is odd.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number'.",
  "sinks": "Return statement output, which is the result of a simple computation.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly into the modulo operation and the comparison, then outputs the boolean result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and does not contain any suspicious or unusual elements.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that takes a number and checks if it is odd by computing the modulo 2 and comparing the result to zero. The logic is simple and clear, with no hardcoded credentials, external data reads, or suspicious behavior. No obfuscation, dynamic execution, or data leakage points are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a basic parity check with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is a safe, standard implementation.",
