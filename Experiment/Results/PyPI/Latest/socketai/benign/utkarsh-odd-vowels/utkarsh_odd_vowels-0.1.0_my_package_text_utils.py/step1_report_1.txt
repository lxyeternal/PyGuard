{
  "purpose": "Count vowels and consonants in a given text string.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing counts; no external data sinks or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is processed internally; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code performs straightforward text processing.",
  "analysis": "The function initializes vowel and consonant counts, iterates over each character in the input string, checks if the character is alphabetic, and then increments the respective counter based on whether the character is a vowel or consonant. The implementation is simple, with no external calls, file I/O, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The logic is clear and standard for such text analysis tasks, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function that counts vowels and consonants. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks.",
