{
  "purpose": "Count vowels and consonants in a given text string",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text', which is a string provided to the function",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing counts; no untrusted data sinks observed",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows through character iteration to counting logic, then results are returned",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures detected; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed",
  "analysis": "The function iterates over each character in the input string, checks if it is an alphabetic character, then increments vowel or consonant counters accordingly. The vowels are explicitly defined as a string containing both lowercase and uppercase vowels. The logic is straightforward and does not interact with external systems, files, or network resources. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or environment variable misuse, is present. The code appears to serve a simple counting purpose without any hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for counting vowels and consonants in a string. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
