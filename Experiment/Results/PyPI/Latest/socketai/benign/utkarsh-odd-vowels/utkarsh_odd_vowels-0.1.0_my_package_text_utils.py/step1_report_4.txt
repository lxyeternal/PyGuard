  "purpose": "Count the number of vowels and consonants in a given text string.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' received by the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing a dictionary with counts; no external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows into the loop for character analysis; counts are accumulated and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No suspicious I/O or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The function iterates over each character in the input string, checks if it's an alphabetic character, and counts vowels and consonants accordingly. The logic is straightforward, using a predefined vowels string. No external dependencies or environment variables are accessed. The code does not perform any unsafe operations, data leakage, or malicious activities. The function appears to serve a benign purpose for character counting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple character analysis function with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is secure and has a clear, benign purpose.",
