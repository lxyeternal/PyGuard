  "purpose": "Count vowels and consonants in a given text string.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs a dictionary with counts; no external sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows into the loop for character examination, results are stored in counters, then returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The function straightforwardly counts vowels and consonants in the input string. It uses a simple loop and membership check with a predefined string of vowels. No external or unsafe code, dynamic execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code is clean and standard for such a task, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic counting task with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and purposeful.",
