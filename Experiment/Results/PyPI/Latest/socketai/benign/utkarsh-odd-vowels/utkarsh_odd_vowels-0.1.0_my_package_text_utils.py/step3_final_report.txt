{
  "purpose": "Count vowels and consonants in a given text string.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' which is read directly in the function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the function only processes the input string locally.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows through iteration, with classification into vowels or consonants based on character membership.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code iterates over each character in the input string, checks if it is an alphabetic character, then increments vowel or consonant counters accordingly. It uses a static string of vowels for classification. No external dependencies, network activity, or file operations are present. The logic is correct and simple, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The code does not handle secrets, credentials, or external data, and performs a benign text processing task.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for counting vowels and consonants, with no malicious or security concerns. The analysis and scores are consistent with its straightforward nature.",
