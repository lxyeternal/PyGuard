  "purpose": "Count vowels and consonants in the given text string.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' (function argument).",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing counts; no external sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows through iteration, affecting counters, then results are returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The function processes input text by iterating over each character. It checks if characters are alphabetic and counts vowels and consonants accordingly. The code uses a simple loop and string containment check, with no external network access, no code injection, and no use of environment variables. It performs a straightforward task without side effects or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign operation to count vowels and consonants, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
