{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import utility functions, likely for checking if a number is odd and for counting vowels and consonants in text.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .odd_checker and .text_utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not perform any data output or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed as the code only imports functions without executing them",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward import statements with no suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for functions from local modules. There is no execution, data handling, or untrusted input processing visible. The modules imported suggest utility functions related to number and text processing. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code structure is standard and minimal.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import of utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any harmful actions or suspicious behaviors.",
