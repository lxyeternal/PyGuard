{
  "purpose": "The code imports two local utility modules, 'odd_checker' and 'text_utils', and does not perform any operations or external communications.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: '.odd_checker' and '.text_utils'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output data, nor does it interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules without executing further logic.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code execution, data handling, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, indicating standard practice without any malicious intent. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The functions imported are benign utility functions. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these assessments. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward import statement with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
