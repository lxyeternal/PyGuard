{
  "purpose": "The code imports utility functions 'is_odd' and 'count_vowels_and_consonants' from local modules, likely for processing or analyzing text or numbers.",
  "sources": "No data input sources or external data reads are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is observable in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The imports are straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs import statements from local modules, which suggests modular design. No external data, network activity, or potentially malicious code is included. The functions' names imply standard utility functions for checking odd numbers and counting vowels/consonants, which are benign. The code fragment is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports utility functions. There are no signs of obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious activities.",
