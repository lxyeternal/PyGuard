  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate the provided reports and the code snippet.\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\nfrom .odd_checker import is_odd\nfrom .text_utils import count_vowels_and_consonants\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. Presence of Malicious Code or Anomalies\n- **Observation:** All reports correctly identify that the code only contains import statements from local modules. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or other suspicious constructs.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears benign. No malicious behavior or anomalies are present.\n\n### 2. Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports\n- **Assessment:** The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly interpret the import statements as benign, standard practice, and free of malicious intent.\n- **Note:** No errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n### 3. Scoring Analysis\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign a security risk of 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores are reasonable and justified given the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n\n### 4. Justification for Any Higher Risk Scores\n- Since there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities, raising scores above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The code does not perform any operations, data handling, or network communication that could introduce risk.\n\n### 5. Consistency and Assumptions\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the import statements as benign.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the analysis is straightforward.\n\n### 6. Final Personal Assessment\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely structural, with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\n- The code is a simple, standard import statement.\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n- Scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep all scores at 0, as the code poses no security risk.",
