  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules (.odd_checker and .text_utils).\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are noted.\n- The code is minimal, standard, and benign in nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The reports consistently conclude that there are no malicious behaviors, no security risks, and no signs of obfuscation.\n- Malware scores are uniformly 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- Confidence scores are 1, reflecting high certainty in these assessments.\n\n**Critical review:**\n- The code only performs import statements, which are typical and harmless.\n- There are no signs of malicious activity, such as network calls, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- The functions imported are named for benign utility tasks (checking odd numbers, counting vowels/consonants).\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- The malware scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- The security risk scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- The confidence scores of 1 are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Based on the provided code snippets and reports, I agree with the assessments.\n- There is no evidence of malicious activity or security issues.\n- The code is standard, straightforward, and benign.\n\n**Final estimation:**\n- Malware score: **0**\n- Obfuscated score: **0**\n- Risk score: **0**\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign import statements with no security concerns. No adjustments needed.",
