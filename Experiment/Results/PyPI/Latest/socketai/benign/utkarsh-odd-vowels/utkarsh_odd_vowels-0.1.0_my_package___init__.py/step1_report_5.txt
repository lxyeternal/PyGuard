  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling visible in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected in the import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports two functions from internal modules, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hardcoded credentials, network connections, or data exfiltration. The code snippet is minimal and does not perform any operations itself.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be a harmless import statement in a typical codebase.",
