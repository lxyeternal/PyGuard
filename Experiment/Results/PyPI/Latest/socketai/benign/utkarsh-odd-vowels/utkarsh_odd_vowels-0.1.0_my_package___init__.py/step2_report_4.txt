  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The functions' names suggest benign utility functions: `is_odd` and `count_vowels_and_consonants`.\n- The overall conclusion in each report is that the code is benign, with no malicious activity or security risks.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code snippet only contains import statements; no actual logic, data processing, or external communication.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, obfuscation, or hidden payloads.\n   - **Confirmed:** No issues are present in the code snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly noting the benign nature of the code.\n   - They correctly identify the lack of anomalies or suspicious constructs.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `confidence: 1`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign zero risk, and the code is clearly benign, no justification for higher scores is needed.\n   - If any report had assigned higher scores, I would scrutinize the reasoning, but they did not.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code only imports benign utility functions.\n   - No malicious activity is indicated.\n   - Malware score remains at 0, which is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n   - No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final notes:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward import of local utility functions with no indication of malicious intent or security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score |\n|------------------|--------------|\n| Malware          | 0            |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            |\n| Security Risk    | 0            |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is benign, with no security risks or malware indicators. The reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
