  "purpose": "Unit test for report generation functions to verify output correctness",
  "sources": "Test data dictionary used as input for report functions",
  "sinks": "Output of generate_md_report and generate_html_report functions",
  "flows": "Input data -> report functions -> generated report content",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code structures, no dynamic execution, no suspicious variable names",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and functions from a report module. It creates a data dictionary with scores and suggestions, then calls generate_md_report and generate_html_report with this data, asserting that certain expected strings are in the output. No input validation or dynamic code execution is present. The test appears to verify report content generation. No malicious or suspicious code observed. The functions themselves are external and their implementation is not provided, but the test code itself is straightforward and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard unit test script verifying report functions; there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks in this code.",
