{
  "purpose": "This code is a test script that verifies the functionality of report generation functions, specifically for Markdown and HTML report outputs.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'data' dictionary defined within the test function.",
  "sinks": "The code uses assertions to verify that generated report strings contain expected content; no untrusted data flows directly to insecure sinks.",
  "flows": "Input data from the 'data' dictionary is processed by generate_md_report and generate_html_report functions, then checked for specific content.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected. The code appears straightforward, serving testing purposes only.",
  "analysis": "The script imports testing functions and report generation functions, then defines a simple test that creates sample data, calls report functions, and asserts expected content. There are no external inputs, network operations, or file manipulations. The code structure and logic are standard for unit tests, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The data used is static and does not include secrets or sensitive info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test script that verifies report generation functionalities. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The overall security risk is negligible.",
