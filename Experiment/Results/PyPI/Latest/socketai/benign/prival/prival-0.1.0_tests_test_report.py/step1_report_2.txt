{
  "purpose": "This code is a test script for verifying the functionality of report generation functions (generate_md_report and generate_html_report) from the prival.report module.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; the code uses a predefined data dictionary within the test function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs to external systems or files are present; the code only calls functions and asserts expected content within returned strings.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the local dictionary to the generate_md_report and generate_html_report functions, and the results are checked via assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The test appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple pytest test function that creates a data structure, invokes two report generation functions, and asserts that specific expected strings are present in the outputs. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The focus is on validating output content. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard unit test for report generation functions with no malicious intent or security concerns. It simply verifies that the functions include expected content based on input data.",
