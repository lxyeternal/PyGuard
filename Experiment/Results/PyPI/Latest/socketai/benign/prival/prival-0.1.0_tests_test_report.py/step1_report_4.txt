  "purpose": "Unit testing the report generation functions to verify output contains expected data.",
  "sources": "Input data dictionary within the test function.",
  "sinks": "generate_md_report and generate_html_report functions, which likely produce report strings.",
  "flows": "Test data -> report generation functions -> output assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing functions and report generation functions, then defines a test that creates a sample data dictionary, calls report functions, and asserts expected substrings in the outputs. No input from untrusted sources, no network, no file operations, and no suspicious code flow detected. The functions tested are presumed to generate reports based on provided data, which appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward test code for report generation and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
