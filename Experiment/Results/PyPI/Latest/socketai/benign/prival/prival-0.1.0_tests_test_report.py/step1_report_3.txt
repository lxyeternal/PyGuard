  "purpose": "Unit testing for report generation functions in the prival.report module.",
  "sources": "Input data dictionary used within the test function.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output, network transmission, or file operations that involve untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input data is used internally within the functions generate_md_report and generate_html_report, which are external but not provided here, so no source-to-sink flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors are present in the test code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and specific functions from prival.report. It defines a test function that creates a data dictionary with straightforward, hardcoded values. It calls two report functions and asserts expected content in their outputs. There are no input sources involving external untrusted data, no data leakage mechanisms, and no dangerous behaviors or obfuscated code. The test is standard and does not perform any network, file, or environment variable operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical unit test for report functions with no malicious or security concerns. It solely verifies output content given controlled input.",
