  "purpose": "A simple unit test verifying report generation functions produce expected output content.",
  "sources": "Static data within the test function, calling generate_md_report and generate_html_report with controlled input.",
  "sinks": "Output strings checked for specific substrings; no untrusted data or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input data passed directly to report functions; outputs checked for expected content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no suspicious patterns or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest unit test that creates static data, calls report functions, and asserts expected substrings are present. No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are involved. The functions under test are external, but their implementation is not provided; the test itself is benign. All reports correctly identify the code as a benign, straightforward test with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1). No logical flaws or assumptions are evident, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static unit test verifying report content. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
