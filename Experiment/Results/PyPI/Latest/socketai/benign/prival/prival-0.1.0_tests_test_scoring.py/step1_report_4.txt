  "purpose": "Unit tests for the function compute_overall_score in the prival.scoring module.",
  "sources": "The test functions call compute_overall_score, which reads from the provided dictionaries 'scores' and 'weights'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or security issues are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from test inputs ('scores' and 'weights' dictionaries) into the compute_overall_score function, with no further data propagation or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be standard test code without any suspicious or unusual patterns; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest for testing purposes and defines two simple test functions to verify the behavior of compute_overall_score with different inputs. There are no dynamic code execution, external data access, or sensitive operations. The code strictly performs basic assertions on a scoring function, which is common in unit testing. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard test code intended for unit testing a scoring function. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated elements. It simply verifies the correctness of the function with controlled inputs.",
