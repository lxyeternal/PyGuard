{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'compute_overall_score' function in the 'prival.scoring' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing pytest and the function 'compute_overall_score'. No external data sources or user input are used.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or write data to external sources.",
  "flows": "The code calls 'compute_overall_score' with predefined dictionaries, testing its output. No untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward test cases with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest for testing, defines two test functions to verify the behavior of 'compute_overall_score' with different inputs, and asserts expected outputs. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or data leaks. The code is typical test code for a Python module, with standard patterns and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign test suite for a scoring function. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security issues.",
