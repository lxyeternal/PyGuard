  "purpose": "Unit tests for the compute_overall_score function in the prival.scoring module.",
  "sources": "The code imports pytest and the compute_overall_score function; reads test input data for scores and weights.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Test functions provide data to compute_overall_score and verify its output; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two straightforward pytest functions that test the behavior of compute_overall_score with empty and simple data inputs. It imports necessary modules and performs assertions. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code is standard for testing purposes and contains no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal unit testing script with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It simply tests a function with fixed data inputs.",
