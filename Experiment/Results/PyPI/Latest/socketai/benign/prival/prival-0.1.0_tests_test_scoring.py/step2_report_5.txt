  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple, straightforward unit tests for the `compute_overall_score` function.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or untrusted data flows are identified.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns are reported.\n- The code is standard testing code, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, and a security risk score of 0.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), indicating certainty in their assessments.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippets and descriptions do not reveal any malicious intent, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n- The function under test (`compute_overall_score`) appears to perform basic calculations based on provided dictionaries, with no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The reports are consistent in their evaluation, and their reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports give 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports give 0, which is justified given the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n- The scoring reflects this accurately.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final note:** The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall assessment confirms that this is a safe, standard unit testing script with no security risks.",
