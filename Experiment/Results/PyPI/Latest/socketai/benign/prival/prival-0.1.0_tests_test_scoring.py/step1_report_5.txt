  "purpose": "Unit tests for the scoring module's compute_overall_score function",
  "sources": "Imports pytest and the compute_overall_score function from prival.scoring module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external calls observed",
  "flows": "Test data flows from test functions to the scoring function; no external or untrusted data flow detected",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded data used in tests are typical for unit testing, no secrets or unusual code present",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard pytest unit tests verifying the behavior of compute_overall_score with predefined inputs. It imports only necessary modules and functions, performs straightforward assertions. No external network or file operations are involved. The test data are hardcoded and serve purely for validation purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe unit test suite with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
