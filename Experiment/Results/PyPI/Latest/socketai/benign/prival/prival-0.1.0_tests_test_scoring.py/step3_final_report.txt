  "purpose": "Unit tests for the compute_overall_score function in prival.scoring module.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded input dictionaries within test functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "flows": "Input dictionaries passed directly to compute_overall_score; no external flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward test code with fixed data.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, deterministic test suite with no external dependencies, no network or file operations, and no obfuscated or malicious code. It tests the scoring function with controlled inputs and expected outputs. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are present. The code's clarity and simplicity support a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The reports' assessments are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
