  "purpose": "Unit tests for the scoring function in the prival package, specifically testing compute_overall_score.",
  "sources": "Imports pytest and the compute_overall_score function from prival.scoring.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data to external systems or handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is purely testing functions without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward testing code with standard syntax and structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines two simple test functions to verify scoring calculations. There is no evidence of malicious activity, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The tests evaluate basic functionality of the scoring function with controlled input values. The code is clean, standard testing practice, and does not perform any network or system operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard testing code with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It solely tests the scoring function for expected output given specific inputs.",
