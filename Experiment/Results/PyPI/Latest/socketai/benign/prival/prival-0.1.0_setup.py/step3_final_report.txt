  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging the 'prival' Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, dependencies, and configuration parameters within setup.py.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; typical package setup process.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration script with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The provided setup.py is a conventional package configuration script with no embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious dependencies. The dependencies listed are common in NLP projects. The reports are empty, indicating no issues or findings. Given the absence of any suspicious activity, the code appears benign. The lack of detailed reports prevents identification of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The scores should reflect no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The empty reports suggest either no issues or a failure in report generation. The overall security posture is safe, with scores set to zero for malware and obfuscation, and a minimal risk score.",
