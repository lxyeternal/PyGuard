  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The provided code is a typical `setup.py` configuration for a Python package. There are no apparent malicious code snippets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a straightforward setup script.\n\n2. **Review of the reports:**  \n   All reports are marked with \"Empty response\" and contain no details or findings. This suggests either a failure in report generation or that no issues were identified or reported.\n\n3. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   Since the reports contain no content, there are no logical flaws or errors to critique within them.\n\n4. **Scores and their reasonableness:**  \n   - **Malware score:** Since there's no evidence of malicious activity, the malware score should be 0.  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation is apparent; thus, this should also be 0.  \n   - **Risk score:** Without any reported issues, the risk score should be minimal, likely 0 or close to it.\n\n5. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   No claims are made; the reports are empty.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n   Given the lack of content, the scores should reflect no detected issues.\n\n7. **Overall assessment:**  \n   - The code itself appears benign and standard.  \n   - The absence of report details prevents any further analysis or suspicion.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the provided code and the empty reports, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports do not provide any data to suggest otherwise. The scores should reflect this lack of issues.\n\nPlease ensure that future reports contain detailed findings for more thorough analysis.",
