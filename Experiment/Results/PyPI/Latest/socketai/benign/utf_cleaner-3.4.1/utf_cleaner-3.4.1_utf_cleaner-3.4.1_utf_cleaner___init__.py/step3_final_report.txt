{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically installs a package from a remote GitHub URL during runtime, then imports it and a local module, without verification or error handling. This pattern introduces significant supply chain security risks.",
  "sources": "The subprocess call executing 'pip install' from an unverified remote URL; reading input from the network during installation.",
  "sinks": "The import statement 'import gits' which executes code from the installed package; potential code execution during package import.",
  "flows": "Remote URL fetch during subprocess call -> execution of remote code during pip install -> import of 'gits' which runs package code.",
  "anomalies": "Silent error handling with 'try: ... except: pass' conceals installation failures; no checksum or signature verification of the remote package; direct execution of untrusted code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs remote installation of a package from an untrusted source without verification, which can execute malicious code during install or import. Silent error handling further obscures failures, increasing security risk. The pattern is inherently dangerous in untrusted environments, with high potential for malicious payloads. The code's straightforward structure does not obfuscate intent but facilitates supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code poses a high security risk due to runtime remote code execution without verification. It can execute malicious payloads if the remote repository is compromised. The silent error handling exacerbates the risk by hiding failures. Overall, this pattern should be avoided or mitigated with proper verification measures.",
