{
  "purpose": "The code appears to install a Python package directly from a GitHub repository and then imports modules, including a local cleaner module.",
  "sources": "Reading input from os.devnull for suppressing output during pip install; reading from sys.executable, sys, os, and the GitHub URL for package installation.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.check_call executes pip install, which can be a sink for executing untrusted commands if the URL or parameters are manipulated; importing gits and cleaner modules might be suspicious if these contain malicious code.",
  "flows": "Code reads data for package installation URL and environment; executes pip install command; then loads modules, potentially executing malicious code if the repository or modules are malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Automatically installing a package from a remote repository during runtime is suspicious, especially if the source is untrusted; minimal error handling (try-except-pass) could hide failures or malicious activity. The code does not verify the integrity of the installed package.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically installs a package from a GitHub URL without validation, which can introduce malicious code if the repository is compromised. It suppresses output during installation, making detection harder. Importing modules from this repository and local modules afterward could execute malicious code embedded within them. The code’s structure and behavior are minimal but can be exploited for supply chain attacks. No hardcoded secrets are present, but the method of fetching and executing external code is risky. The use of try-except with a pass statement prevents error visibility, potentially hiding malicious failures.",
  "conclusion": "The code installs and imports potentially malicious code from an external GitHub repository, which poses a significant security risk. The approach is suspicious due to dynamic remote code execution without verification. Overall, the code is risky and should not be used in secure environments.",
