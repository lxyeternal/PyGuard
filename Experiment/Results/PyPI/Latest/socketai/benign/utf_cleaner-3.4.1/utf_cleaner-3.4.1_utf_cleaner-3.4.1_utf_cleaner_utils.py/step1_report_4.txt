{
  "purpose": "The function checks whether a given character is a valid UTF-8 character.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'char' provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "The function encodes the character; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input 'char' is passed directly to encode(), which can potentially raise an exception if invalid.",
  "anomalies": "The function uses exception handling to verify UTF-8 validity, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to encode a single character into UTF-8. If encoding succeeds, it returns True; if a UnicodeEncodeError is raised, it returns False. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code performs a simple validation of UTF-8 compatibility without any side effects or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility function for UTF-8 validation. It does not contain malicious intent or security risks.",
