  "purpose": "To check if a given character can be encoded in UTF-8, implying it is a valid UTF-8 character.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'char' passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "The 'encode' method on the input character, which could potentially handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input 'char' is passed to 'encode' and, if encoding succeeds, returns True; otherwise, returns False.",
  "anomalies": "The function's logic is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. It performs a simple validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that attempts to encode a single character in UTF-8. If encoding succeeds, the character is valid UTF-8; if not, it catches the UnicodeEncodeError and returns False. The code uses standard Python features, and there are no signs of malicious activity or malicious intent. There are no hardcoded credentials, external network calls, or suspicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The function performs a benign validation of UTF-8 characters without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a simple utility function with no indications of supply chain threats or malware.",
