{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a logging configuration and defines a class for logging character removals, specifically non-UTF characters.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly; it relies on method parameters 'original' and 'cleaned' provided during runtime.",
  "sinks": "The code logs information messages that could potentially leak information if sensitive data is processed in 'original' or 'cleaned'.",
  "flows": "Input strings ('original' and 'cleaned') are compared to identify removed characters; if non-UTF characters are detected, a log entry is created.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets; the logging setup is standard. The comment suggests character removals, but there is no code that removes characters or processes data beyond comparison.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logging system with DEBUG level, which is quite verbose for production. It defines a class with a static method that logs the removal of non-UTF characters by comparing two strings. There are no data sources from user input or external data, only method parameters. The method logs information about characters removed, which could be benign or potentially leak information if 'original' contains sensitive data. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The code does not perform any data modification, network activity, or system commands. The purpose appears to be solely logging character removals.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious intent. It performs a standard logging setup and provides a method to log character removals. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
