{
  "purpose": "To configure logging and define a utility class for tracking removal of non-UTF characters from strings.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines static methods and configuration.",
  "sinks": "The logging.info statement outputs data to logs, but it does not process untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "The log_removal method processes 'original' and 'cleaned' strings to identify removed characters and logs this information.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and self-contained.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up basic logging configuration at DEBUG level, then defines a class with a static method that logs the characters removed when converting or cleaning a string. The method calculates the difference between the original and cleaned strings and logs the removed characters if any. There are no external data sources, no network activity, and no insecure code patterns or malicious intent evident. It appears to be a utility for tracking character removal during text processing, with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves a simple utility purpose, and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It is a straightforward logging utility with no suspicious or harmful elements.",
