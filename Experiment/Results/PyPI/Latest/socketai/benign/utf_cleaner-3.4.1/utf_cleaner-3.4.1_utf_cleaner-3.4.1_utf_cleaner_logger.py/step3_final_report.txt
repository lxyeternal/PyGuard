  "purpose": "Logger for tracking character removals.",
  "sources": "The method log_removal reads 'original' and 'cleaned' string parameters.",
  "sinks": "Logging output may leak sensitive data if 'original' contains secrets.",
  "flows": "The set difference between 'original' and 'cleaned' is computed and logged.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward comparison and logging.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up debug logging, defines a class with a static method that compares two strings to identify removed characters, and logs these characters. It does not perform data modification or network activity. The code is simple, clear, and benign. The only concern is potential leakage of sensitive info via logs if 'original' contains secrets, which is a common logging issue but not malicious. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for logging character removals with minimal security risk. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The slight security concern relates to potential info leakage through logs, but this is typical in debug scenarios and not indicative of malicious intent.",
