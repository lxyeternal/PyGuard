{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom logger class for tracking character removals in strings, potentially for data sanitization or processing.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are explicitly present; the method takes 'original' and 'cleaned' string arguments.",
  "sinks": "Logging function that outputs removal information; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The method compares 'original' and 'cleaned' strings to identify removed characters and logs this information.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward. No unusual or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up basic logging configuration, then defines a class with a static method to log characters removed from a string. It does not read external input, write to system files, or communicate over the network. The method simply logs information about character removal, which could be part of data processing. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code appears benign and focused on logging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for logging character removals; it shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
