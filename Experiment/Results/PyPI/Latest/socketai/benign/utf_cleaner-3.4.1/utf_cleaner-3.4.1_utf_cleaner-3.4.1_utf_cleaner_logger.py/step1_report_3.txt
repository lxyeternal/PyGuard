{
  "purpose": "Set up a logging configuration and define a class for tracking removal of non-UTF characters.",
  "sources": "Logging configuration at the beginning; the log_removal method reads the original string.",
  "sinks": "Logging output (info level) which could potentially leak data if sensitive info is logged.",
  "flows": "The method compares the original string with a cleaned version, and logs removed characters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. Use of set operations is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code configures logging and defines a class with a static method to log non-UTF characters removed from a string. There are no external inputs or untrusted data sources, nor any dangerous data flows. Logging may leak sensitive information if the 'original' data contains secrets, but this is typical for debug logs. The code appears to serve a benign purpose related to character filtering and logging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign logging utility for tracking character removals, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior observed.",
