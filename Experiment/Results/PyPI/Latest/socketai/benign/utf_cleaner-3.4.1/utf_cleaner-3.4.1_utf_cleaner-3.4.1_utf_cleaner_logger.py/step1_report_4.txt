{
  "purpose": "The code sets up logging configuration and defines a class to log removal of non-UTF characters from strings.",
  "sources": "The static method log_removal reads input parameters 'original' and 'cleaned' strings.",
  "sinks": "Logging information could be written to console or log files, potentially revealing character removal details.",
  "flows": "Input strings 'original' and 'cleaned' are compared; differences are logged as info messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code's purpose appears to be character filtering and logging.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the logging module and configures it to DEBUG level, then defines a class with a static method to log removal of non-UTF characters. The method computes the set difference between the original and cleaned strings and logs any removed characters. There are no external data inputs, network activity, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward and appears to serve a benign purpose related to string processing and logging.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign; it implements character filtering and logging without any malicious intent or security risks.",
