  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:\n   - The code defines two classes:\n     ```python\n     class UTFCleaningError(Exception):\n         \"\"\"Base exception for UTF cleaning errors.\"\"\"\n         pass\n\n     class InvalidInputError(UTFCleaningError):\n         \"\"\"Raised when input is not a valid string.\"\"\"\n         def __init__(self, message=\"Input must be a string.\"):\n             super().__init__(message)\n     ```\n   - These are static class definitions with no dynamic behavior, data processing, or external dependencies.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for custom exception classes.\n\n2. **Logical and Security Flaws**:\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are observed.\n   - No input/output handling, data flows, or external data sources are involved.\n   - The code serves purely as error categorization, which is typical and benign.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1.0 (high, justified)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0.0 (correct)\n     - `malware`: 0.0 (correct)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0.0 (correct)\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Malware and Risk Justification**:\n   - Since there's no malicious activity, malware score remains at 0.\n   - The risk score is also 0, reflecting no security concern.\n   - No reason to elevate scores; the code is benign.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as purely structural with no hidden behaviors.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is appropriate.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency**:\n   - The reports are consistent with each other and accurately reflect the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0.0** — No malicious activity or intent detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0.0** — Clear, straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk Score**: **0.0** — No security risk associated with this code.\n\n### Additional Comments:\nGiven the code's simplicity and the reports' thoroughness, I agree with the current scores. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation**: Maintain the current scores.",
