  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling UTF cleaning errors and invalid input errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external output; no sinks involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code consists solely of class definitions and inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes, 'UTFCleaningError' and 'InvalidInputError', both inheriting from Exception. The second class provides a default error message and uses super() for initialization. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or external dependencies. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard implementation of custom exceptions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
