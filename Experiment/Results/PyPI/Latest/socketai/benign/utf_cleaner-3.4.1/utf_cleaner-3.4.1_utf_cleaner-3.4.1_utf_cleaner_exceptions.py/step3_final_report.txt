  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for UTF cleaning errors and invalid input handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for UTFCleaningError and InvalidInputError, including inheritance and default message assignment.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, external dependencies, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Class inheritance and instantiation do not involve data flows or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static class definitions for custom exceptions, with proper inheritance and default messages. No dynamic behavior, input/output, or external dependencies are involved. The code is straightforward, standard, and serves as error handling mechanisms. No vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious activity are present. The scores assigned across reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent and justified based on the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
