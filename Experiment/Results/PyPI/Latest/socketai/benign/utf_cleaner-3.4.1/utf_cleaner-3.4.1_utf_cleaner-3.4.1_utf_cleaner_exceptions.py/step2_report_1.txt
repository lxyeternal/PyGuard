  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No dynamic code, data input/output, or external dependencies are involved.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are observed.\n- The purpose is purely structural, serving as error handling mechanisms.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code matches the descriptions; no issues are present.\n   - The exception classes are correctly defined, with proper inheritance and default messages.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws are evident.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0.0`, which is appropriate.\n   - `obfuscated: 0.0` is correct.\n   - `securityRisk: 0.0` is justified.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1.0, reflecting certainty.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - No reason exists to assign a higher risk score; the code is purely structural.\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n5. **Malware score:**\n   - Correctly assigned as 0.0 across all reports.\n   - No malicious activity is present.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's actual content.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - Scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — no security risk.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- Given the simplicity and clarity, I concur with the assessments.\n- There is no need to adjust scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
