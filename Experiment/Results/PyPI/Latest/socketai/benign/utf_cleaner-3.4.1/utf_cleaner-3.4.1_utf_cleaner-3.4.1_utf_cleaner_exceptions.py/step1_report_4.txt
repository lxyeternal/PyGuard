  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling UTF cleaning errors and invalid input errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code; it only defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, output, or data leak points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink since the code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from built-in Exception. It includes a base exception class for UTF cleaning errors and a specific subclass for invalid input errors with a default message. No data input, network activity, or code execution is present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely structural, defining exception classes without any malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
