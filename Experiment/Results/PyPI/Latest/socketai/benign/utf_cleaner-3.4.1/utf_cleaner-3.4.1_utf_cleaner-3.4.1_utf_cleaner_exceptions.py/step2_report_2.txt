  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is static, straightforward, defining custom exception classes.\n- No input/output, data flow, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are identified.\n- All scores assigned are 1.0 for confidence and 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The code is simple class definitions inheriting from Exception.\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and purely structural.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**\n   - No errors or flaws are evident in the reports' reasoning; they correctly interpret the code.\n\n3. **Scores evaluation:**\n   - The scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are all 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are 1.0, reflecting certainty.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - All scores are 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n   - No reason to increase risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code contains only exception class definitions, no malicious activity.\n   - Scores of 0 are correct.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the simplicity and benign nature, I concur with the reports' scores.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No security risks, obfuscation, or malware are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate. No modifications needed. The code poses no security concern.",
