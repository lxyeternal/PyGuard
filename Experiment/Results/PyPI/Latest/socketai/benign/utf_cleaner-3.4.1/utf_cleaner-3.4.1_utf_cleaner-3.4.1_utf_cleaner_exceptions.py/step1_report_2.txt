  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling UTF cleaning errors and invalid input errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward class definitions with no suspicious patterns or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two exception classes: UTFCleaningError and InvalidInputError, which inherit from Exception and a custom base class. They serve to categorize specific error conditions related to UTF cleaning and invalid inputs. There are no external data inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The code is simple and adheres to standard Python practices for custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining custom exception classes without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or contain suspicious logic.",
