  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No input/output, data processing, network activity, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python practices.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Issue Confirmation:**\n- The code matches the description: two classes, `UTFCleaningError` and `InvalidInputError`, with the latter providing a default message and using `super()` for initialization.\n- No errors, flaws, or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n**Scores and Reasoning:**\n- All reports assign a security risk score of 0, which is justified.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n- The confidence score is 1, reflecting high certainty about the benign and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Potential Issues or Misjudgments:**\n- None identified. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No need to adjust scores.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a simple, standard implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No security risks, malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the understanding that the code is purely structural and non-malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. No modifications are necessary. The code is safe, benign, and standard.",
