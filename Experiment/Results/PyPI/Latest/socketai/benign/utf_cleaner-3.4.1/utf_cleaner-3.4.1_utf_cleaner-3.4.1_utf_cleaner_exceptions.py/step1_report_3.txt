  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling UTF cleaning errors.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output or sinks; only class and exception definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward class inheritance for exceptions; no unusual or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base exception class 'UTFCleaningError' and a derived exception 'InvalidInputError' with a default message. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external dependencies. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The code appears to serve as a part of input validation or error handling mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling related to UTF cleaning. It shows no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
