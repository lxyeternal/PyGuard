  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - There are no dynamic behaviors, input/output operations, or external dependencies.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious code are observed.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0.0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0.0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is 0.0, aligning with the lack of vulnerabilities.\n   - Confidence levels are at 1.0, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since there is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The consistent zero scores across malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk reinforce the benign assessment.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities or malicious intent are claimed.\n\n6. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis provided.\n   - The high confidence levels are justified.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, simple implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No security risks, malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risks or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
