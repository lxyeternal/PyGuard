  "purpose": "A utility class for removing non-UTF characters from input text with optional multiprocessing support.",
  "sources": "Input text passed to the 'clean' method",
  "sinks": "Logging function 'UTFLogger.log_removal' which records input and output texts",
  "flows": "Input text -> UTFValidator.validate_input -> (conditional) UTFMultiprocessingHandler.filter_with_multiprocessing or character filtering -> UTFLogger.log_removal",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious external network activity, and no unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input text, then either processes it with multiprocessing or character-by-character filtering to remove non-UTF characters. It logs the removal process. The functions invoked are assumed to be standard utility functions for validation, filtering, and logging. There are no signs of malicious code or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for text cleaning without external data exfiltration or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for cleaning text data. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
