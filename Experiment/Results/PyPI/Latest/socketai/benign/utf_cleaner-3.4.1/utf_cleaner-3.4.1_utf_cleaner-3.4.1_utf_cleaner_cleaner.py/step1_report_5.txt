  "purpose": "A class for removing non-UTF characters from input text, with optional multiprocessing support.",
  "sources": "UTFValidator.validate_input(text) for input validation",
  "sinks": "UTFLogger.log_removal(text, cleaned_text) for logging removal actions",
  "flows": "Input text -> validate input -> clean characters (with or without multiprocessing) -> log removal",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for validation, logging, utility functions, and multiprocessing. The class 'UTFStringCleaner' has an initializer that toggles multiprocessing use. The 'clean' method validates input, then either processes the text with multiprocessing or filters characters using a generator expression. Finally, it logs the removal process. The methods used appear straightforward and intended for character filtering, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for filtering non-UTF characters with optional multiprocessing. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues are evident. It operates as expected for text cleaning purposes.",
