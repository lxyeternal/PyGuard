  "purpose": "A utility class for removing non-UTF characters from input text, with optional multiprocessing support and logging.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' in the 'clean' method, and the imported modules: UTFValidator.validate_input, is_utf_character, UTFLogger.log_removal, UTFMultiprocessingHandler.filter_with_multiprocessing",
  "sinks": "UTFValidator.validate_input (input validation), is_utf_character (character filtering), UTFLogger.log_removal (logging process), optional multiprocessing handler (if used)",
  "flows": "Input text is validated, then either processed via multiprocessing or filtered character-by-character for UTF compliance, then logged, and returned",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; straightforward implementation; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code validates input, filters non-UTF characters either sequentially or via multiprocessing, and logs the removal. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or network activity is evident. The imported modules are assumed to be standard utility functions. The logic is clear and typical for text sanitization. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0, and the security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for cleaning non-UTF characters with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality. No modifications are necessary.",
