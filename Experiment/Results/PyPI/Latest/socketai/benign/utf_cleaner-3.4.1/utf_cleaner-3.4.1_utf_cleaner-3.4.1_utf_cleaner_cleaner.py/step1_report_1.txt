  "purpose": "A utility class for removing non-UTF characters from input text with optional multiprocessing support and logging.",
  "sources": "UTFValidator.validate_input(text)",
  "sinks": "UTFLogger.log_removal(text, cleaned_text)",
  "flows": "Input text -> Validation -> Cleaning (multiprocessing or single-threaded) -> Logging of removal",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input text, then removes non-UTF characters either via multiprocessing or a simple generator. It logs the removal process. All functions appear standard, with no signs of malicious data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious network activity. The imports are from local modules, and their content isn't provided, but based on this code alone, behavior is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a straightforward UTF character cleaner with logging. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. It does not contain obfuscation or malware-like behavior.",
