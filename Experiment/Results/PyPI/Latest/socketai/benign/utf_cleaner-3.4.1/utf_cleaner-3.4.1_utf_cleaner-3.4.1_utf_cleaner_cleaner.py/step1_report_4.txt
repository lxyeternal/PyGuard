  "purpose": "A utility class to remove non-UTF characters from input text with optional multiprocessing support.",
  "sources": "UTFValidator.validate_input(text), is_utf_character(c), input parameter 'text'",
  "sinks": "UTFLogger.log_removal(text, cleaned_text)",
  "flows": "Input text -> validate_input -> (if multiprocessing) filter_with_multiprocessing or generator expression -> log_removal",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of validation, logging, and multiprocessing handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input text, then either processes it via multiprocessing or a generator expression to remove non-UTF characters, then logs the removal. All functions used seem to be standard utility functions; no signs of obfuscated code or malicious data transmission. Logging appears to be for operational purposes only. The code is straightforward and does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard operation of cleaning text from non-UTF characters, with proper validation and optional multiprocessing. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks within this code segment.",
