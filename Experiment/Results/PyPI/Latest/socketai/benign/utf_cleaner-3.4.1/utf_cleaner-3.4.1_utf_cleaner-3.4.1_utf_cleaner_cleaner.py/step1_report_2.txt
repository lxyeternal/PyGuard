  "purpose": "A utility class for removing non-UTF characters from input text, with optional multiprocessing support.",
  "sources": "UTFValidator.validate_input(text) reading input; is_utf_character(c) checking each character; input parameter 'text' provided to clean() method.",
  "sinks": "UTFLogger.log_removal(text, cleaned_text) logging the original and cleaned text.",
  "flows": "Input text → validation → character filtering (either multiprocessing or sequential) → logging of removal process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. No external network access or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward input validation, character filtering, and logging. It utilizes imported modules for validation, logging, and multiprocessing handling, which are assumed to be standard utility modules. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data theft, code injection, or external data transmission. The code's purpose aligns with its structure, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for cleaning text of non-UTF characters. No malicious intent or security risks are evident based on the provided code. It functions as intended without suspicious behaviors.",
