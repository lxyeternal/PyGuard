{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for the 'utf-cleaner' Python package, specifying its metadata and packaging details.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package name, version, description, author info, URL, packages list, classifiers, and Python requirements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input data or handle sensitive information dynamically; all data are static strings or function calls with predetermined parameters.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows from sources to sinks; the setup process uses predefined package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic; the code is straightforward package setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' to facilitate package setup. It defines package metadata including name, version, description, author info, URL, and required Python version. The 'find_packages()' function is used to automatically include packages. Classifiers specify metadata about language, license, and OS compatibility. All data are static and explicitly defined, with no dynamic or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign setup configuration script for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It appears to be a normal package setup file.",
