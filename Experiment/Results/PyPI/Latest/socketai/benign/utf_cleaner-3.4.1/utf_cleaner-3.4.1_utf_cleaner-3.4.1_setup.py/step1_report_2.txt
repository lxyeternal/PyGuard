{
  "purpose": "To configure and package a Python library named 'utf-cleaner' for distribution.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the setup parameters such as 'name', 'version', 'author', 'author_email', and 'url'. The 'find_packages()' function also determines package contents.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the 'author_email' and 'url' fields, which could be used to exfiltrate data if malicious code is present, but in this context, they are static strings. The code itself does not perform runtime data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks during execution since this code is a static configuration script. The package metadata is statically defined, and 'find_packages()' returns package list without external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. The script appears to follow standard Python packaging practices with no hidden or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration script for a Python package. It specifies package metadata such as name, version, description, author details, URL, package discovery, classifiers, and required Python version. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscated segments. All elements are standard for package distribution. The static nature of this code reduces the likelihood of runtime malicious behavior. No external input or dynamic execution is present that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It contains no malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks. The package appears safe based on this isolated analysis.",
