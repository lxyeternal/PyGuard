{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the 'utf-cleaner' Python package, including metadata and package discovery instructions.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the import statements for 'setuptools', data from 'find_packages()', and the static parameters provided to 'setup()'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that process untrusted input; the code solely defines package metadata and setup instructions.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; the code performs static configuration tasks only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code features are present. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with static metadata parameters such as package name, version, description, author info, URL, classifiers, and Python version requirements. The 'find_packages()' function dynamically discovers packages in the project directory but is standard practice. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package distribution. No suspicious or malicious behavior, code injection, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a legitimate and safe configuration file.",
