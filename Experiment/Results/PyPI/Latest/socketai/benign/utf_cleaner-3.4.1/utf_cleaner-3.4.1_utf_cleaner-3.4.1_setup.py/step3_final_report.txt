  "purpose": "The code serves as a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'utf-cleaner', defining package metadata and discovery parameters.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields such as name, version, description, author, author_email, url, classifiers, and python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data, nor does it perform any network or file operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is static and does not involve data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward, static setup configuration with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard 'setup.py' script using setuptools, with static metadata and package discovery via find_packages(). No dynamic code, input handling, or network operations are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, and the metadata points to a typical open-source project. The scores are consistent with the static, straightforward nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The provided reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the static analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
