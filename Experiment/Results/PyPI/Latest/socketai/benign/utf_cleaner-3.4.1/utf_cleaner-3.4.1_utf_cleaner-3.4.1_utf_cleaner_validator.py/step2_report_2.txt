  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, the code logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a simple static class with a method that checks whether the input `text` is a string.\n- If not, it raises a custom exception `InvalidInputError`.\n- There are no external data sources, network calls, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The purpose is straightforward input validation.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Validator for checking if input is a UTF-8 string.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly describes the code as a simple type check, no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, aligns with the code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Validator for UTF-8 strings.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above, straightforward validation.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Validator class for input strings.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above, no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign validation utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Note:** The securityRisk is set to 0.1, which is low but indicates minimal concern—probably because it's a simple validation.\n- **Verdict:** The score seems reasonable, though perhaps slightly cautious.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Validator for UTF-8 strings.\n- **Analysis:** Same straightforward validation.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Note:** Similar to above, low security risk assigned.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Validator for UTF-8 strings.\n- **Analysis:** Same as previous, simple type check.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, and the code is very straightforward.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly note no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Given the simplicity of the code, the risk scores are mostly zero or very low, which is appropriate.\n\n**Any issues?**  \n- The code is very simple; no issues detected.\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The slight difference in `securityRisk` (0.1) in some reports could be justified as a cautious default, but overall, they are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk beyond basic validation)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately score the code's security posture. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the code is benign, always consider that in a real-world scenario, the imported `InvalidInputError` should be reviewed to ensure it is not maliciously altered, but based on the provided context, it appears standard.",
