  "purpose": "Validator class to check if input strings are valid UTF-8 encoded strings.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the parameter 'text' in the validate_input method.",
  "sinks": "The method raises an exception if input is invalid; no external sinks are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is checked for type; if not a string, an exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple validator class that checks if the provided input is a string. It raises an 'InvalidInputError' if the input is not a string. There are no complex data flows, no usage of environment variables, external network calls, or obfuscated code. It appears to be a benign validation utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard input validation snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling.",
