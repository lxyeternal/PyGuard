  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' in the validate_input method.",
  "sinks": "Potential exception raising via InvalidInputError if input is not a string.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is checked; if not a string, an exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class with a static method to validate that input is a string. It raises a custom exception if the check fails. There are no external data sources, network operations, or suspicious logic. The code appears standard and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a basic input validation for UTF-8 string type with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
