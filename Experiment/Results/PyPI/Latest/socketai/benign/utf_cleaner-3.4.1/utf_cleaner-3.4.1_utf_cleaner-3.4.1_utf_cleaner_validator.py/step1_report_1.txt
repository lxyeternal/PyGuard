  "purpose": "Validator for checking if input text is a UTF-8 string.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' in validate_input method.",
  "sinks": "None identified that could lead to data leak or malicious effect.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is checked for type; if not string, raises an error.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple validator class with a static method that checks whether the input 'text' is a string. If not, it raises a custom exception 'InvalidInputError'. There are no external data sources, no network calls, or sensitive operations. The import suggests a custom exception, but nothing indicates malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a basic validation of input type and raises an exception if invalid. It appears benign and aligns with standard validation practices without any malicious activity.",
