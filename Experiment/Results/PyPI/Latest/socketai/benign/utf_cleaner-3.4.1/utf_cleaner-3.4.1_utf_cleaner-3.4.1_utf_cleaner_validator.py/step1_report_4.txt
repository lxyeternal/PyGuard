  "purpose": "Validator for UTF-8 strings to ensure input is of correct type.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided via the 'validate_input' method parameter 'text'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially raises an exception (InvalidInputError) if validation fails.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is checked for type; if not string, an exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'UTFValidator' with a static method that verifies whether the input is a string. If not, it raises an 'InvalidInputError'. This is standard input validation logic with no evident malicious intent. There are no external network calls, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors. The exception class is imported but not detailed; assuming it is a standard or custom validation exception, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple type check for UTF-8 string validation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for input validation without any malicious side effects.",
