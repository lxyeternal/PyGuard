  "purpose": "Validator for UTF-8 strings to ensure input is a string type.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided via the validate_input method parameter 'text'.",
  "sinks": "The method raises an exception if input is not a string; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is checked for type; if not a string, InvalidInputError is raised.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code performs a simple type check.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a validator class with a static method to verify that the input is a string. If the input is not a string, it raises an exception from an imported module. There are no external data leaks, network communications, or obfuscated parts. The exception handling relies on an imported error class, which appears standard. No malicious or suspicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward input validation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a simple type check and raises an exception for invalid input. No malicious intent or security concerns are detected.",
