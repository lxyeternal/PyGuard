  "purpose": "Validator for UTF-8 strings.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' passed to validate_input method.",
  "sinks": "Raising InvalidInputError if input is not a string.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' → isinstance check → raise InvalidInputError if not string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward type check. The class name 'UTFValidator' suggests UTF-8 validation but only checks type, which may be a misnomer but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a static method that verifies if the input is a string. If not, it raises a custom exception. No external data, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The exception class is imported but not detailed; assuming standard or benign. The logic is simple and clear, with no suspicious patterns or behaviors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature. The slight variation in securityRisk scores (0.1) reflects cautious defaulting but is acceptable. Confidence scores are high, indicating certainty in benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward input validator with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
