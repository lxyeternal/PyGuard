  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same core code: a class with a static method that checks if input is a string, raising an exception if not.\n- No report indicates any malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external network calls, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution.\n- The exception class 'InvalidInputError' is imported but not detailed; assuming it's a standard or benign custom exception.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The code as provided performs a simple type check; no issues or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n- They correctly identify the code as a basic validation utility.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which seems reasonable given the simplicity.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the code clarity.\n- Confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), consistent with the straightforward analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No risk scores above 0.5 are assigned, which is appropriate.\n- The code is benign; no justification needed for higher scores.\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- Since no malicious activity is present, malware scores of 0 are justified.\n- The code does not perform any suspicious operations.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The assumption that 'InvalidInputError' is benign is reasonable; no evidence suggests malicious intent.\n- No hidden or obfuscated code is present, so no suspicion there.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores align with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward input validator with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe overall assessment confirms that this code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and poses no security risk. The scores assigned are appropriate.",
