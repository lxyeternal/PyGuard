  "purpose": "To filter out non-UTF characters from a given text using multiprocessing for efficiency.",
  "sources": "Reads input text from the 'filter_with_multiprocessing' method; uses 'text' parameter.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data leading to vulnerabilities; primarily processes in-memory data.",
  "flows": "Input text -> chunk division -> multiprocessing pool -> '_filter_chunk' function -> filtered chunks -> joined result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. Usage of multiprocessing appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper function '_filter_chunk' that filters non-UTF characters by calling 'is_utf_character' for each character. The 'UTFMultiprocessingHandler' class provides a static method to process large text data by dividing it into chunks, processing each in parallel via a multiprocessing pool, and recombining the filtered chunks. The code uses 'cpu_count()' to optimize chunk division and utilizes standard multiprocessing patterns. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or malicious behaviors such as network activity or data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to perform legitimate data filtering using multiprocessing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe implementation of multiprocessing-based text filtering. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The structure and logic are standard for such tasks.",
