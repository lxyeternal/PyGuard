{
  "purpose": "To filter non-UTF characters from a given text using multiprocessing for efficiency.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' passed to the 'filter_with_multiprocessing' method.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data could cause security issues; the code primarily processes data in-memory.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' -> divide into chunks -> process chunks with '_filter_chunk' in parallel -> join filtered chunks into final output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs detected. Use of multiprocessing is standard for performance.",
  "analysis": "The code divides input text into chunks based on CPU count and processes each chunk to remove non-UTF characters via '_filter_chunk'. The filtering relies on 'is_utf_character', which appears to be a utility function. The multiprocessing approach and the logic are straightforward and do not contain obfuscated or malicious patterns. There are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe utility for filtering UTF characters in a multiprocessing manner. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
