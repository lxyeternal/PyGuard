  "purpose": "Filters non-UTF characters from a text string using multiprocessing for performance.",
  "sources": "Reads input string, divides into chunks based on CPU count.",
  "sinks": "Outputs filtered string; no external untrusted sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Splits text into chunks -> processes chunks with _filter_chunk -> joins filtered chunks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward filtering task, dividing input into chunks, processing in parallel with multiprocessing, and recombining. It relies on an external utility 'is_utf_character' assumed benign. No network activity, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior are present. The logic is correct, and the implementation is standard for such a utility. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for filtering non-UTF characters. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 or very low) are accurate and justified.",
