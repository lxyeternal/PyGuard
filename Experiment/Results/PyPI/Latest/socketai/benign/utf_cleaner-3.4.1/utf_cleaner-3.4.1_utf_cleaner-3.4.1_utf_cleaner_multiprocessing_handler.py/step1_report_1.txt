{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility for filtering non-UTF characters from a text string using multiprocessing to improve performance.",
  "sources": "Reads input data through the filter_with_multiprocessing method, which takes a text string as input.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the filtered string; no direct untrusted data sinks are evident within the code.",
  "flows": "Input text is divided into chunks, processed in parallel by _filter_chunk, and then combined into the final output.",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiprocessing for text filtering, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiprocessing components and defines a helper function _filter_chunk for filtering non-UTF characters using an external utility is_utf_character. The class UTFMultiprocessingHandler contains a static method that divides the input text into chunks based on CPU count, processes each chunk in parallel, and joins the results. There are no external network calls, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code performs a straightforward filtering task without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard multiprocessing utility for filtering UTF characters, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended, with no suspicious activities observed.",
