{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to filter out non-UTF characters from a given text using multiprocessing to improve performance.",
  "sources": "The source of data is the 'text' parameter passed to the 'filter_with_multiprocessing' method.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems, network, or files; it only processes and returns filtered text internally.",
  "flows": "Input text is divided into chunks; each chunk is processed by '_filter_chunk', and the results are combined into the final filtered string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or hidden backdoors are evident. Usage of multiprocessing is appropriate for large data processing; no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiprocessing tools to parallelize filtering of text data. The '_filter_chunk' function relies on 'is_utf_character' from a local module to determine valid characters. The 'filter_with_multiprocessing' method splits the input text into chunks based on CPU count, processes each chunk in parallel, and concatenates results. No external data sources, network activity, or potentially malicious code are present. The implementation appears straightforward and intended for efficient text processing.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this code snippet. The code performs a legitimate function using standard multiprocessing techniques. It appears safe and non-malicious.",
