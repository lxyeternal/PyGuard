{
  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions (`Parser`, `arg`) from a local module `.lib` for use in the current script.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module `.lib`.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process input or output.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; this is a static import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement from a local module, with no data processing, network activity, or executable logic. It is standard in Python projects and does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code's simplicity and lack of dynamic or external interactions indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. All reports correctly assess this, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
