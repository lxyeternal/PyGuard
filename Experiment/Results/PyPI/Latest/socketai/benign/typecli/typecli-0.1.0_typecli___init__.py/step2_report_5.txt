  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify their assessments.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The code is a simple import statement from a local module `.lib`.\n- No data flows, sinks, or anomalies are present.\n- The conclusion states the code is benign, which is accurate.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same as Report 1, just a different wording.\n- No data flows, anomalies, or suspicious patterns.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same import statement, minimal analysis.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.8), but still no signs of malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same as above, with high confidence (0.9).\n- No issues found.\n- Scores: all zero.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same analysis, very confident (1).\n- No anomalies or suspicious activity.\n- Scores: all zero.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify that this code snippet is a straightforward import statement from a local module with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Final thoughts:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n### My overall estimate:\nGiven the simplicity of the code, I agree with the current scores. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The import statement is standard and benign.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that this code snippet is safe and poses no security threat.",
