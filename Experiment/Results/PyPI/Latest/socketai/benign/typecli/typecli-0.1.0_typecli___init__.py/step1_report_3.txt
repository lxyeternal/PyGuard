{
  "purpose": "The code imports components 'Parser' and 'arg' from a local module named 'lib', likely for parsing input or arguments.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module, no external data sources or input reads observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data pathways are evident in this small fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "This snippet only shows an import statement from a relative module. It does not contain any processing logic, input handling, or data transmission. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is a standard import statement typical in modular Python code.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this fragment, there are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears benign and standard for Python modules.",
