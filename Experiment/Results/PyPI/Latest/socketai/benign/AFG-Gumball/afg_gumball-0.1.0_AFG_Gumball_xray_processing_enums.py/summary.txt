  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of a static enum with a semantically unusual but harmless term 'WEASAND'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing assessments and scores are appropriate; the overall security risk is negligible."
