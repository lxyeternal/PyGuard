  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for various human body parts",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources present in the code",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output functions",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or output operations present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward enumeration definition",
  "analysis": "The code imports the enum module and defines a class BodyPart as an Enum with various body parts as members, assigned integer values. The structure is standard for enum definitions, with no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or network operations. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The code appears purely definitional and unrelated to any malicious activity or supply chain threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple enumeration definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is benign and only serves to provide named constants for body parts.",
