  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration of human body parts using Python's enum module.",
  "sources": "The enum class BodyPart and its member definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of enum members; no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of 'WEASAND', an archaic or non-standard term for a body part, which is semantically unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward enum declaration listing various anatomical parts. No malicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic behaviors are present. The only anomaly is the term 'WEASAND', which is not a standard anatomical term and may be semantically inconsistent. The code does not involve any data flow, external input, or network activity. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk (~0.1) due to the unusual term. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm no security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of a static enum with a semantically unusual but harmless term 'WEASAND'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing assessments and scores are appropriate; the overall security risk is negligible.",
