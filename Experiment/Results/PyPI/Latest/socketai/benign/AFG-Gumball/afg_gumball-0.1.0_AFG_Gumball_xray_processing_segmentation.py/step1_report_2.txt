{
  "purpose": "Generate a segmentation mask for a specific body part from an X-ray image.",
  "sources": "Reads the input tensor 'image', which is an X-ray image; calls get_segmentation_model() to load a model; uses image.shape to determine padding; uses part.value to get index.",
  "sinks": "Processes the image data through the segmentation model; returns a tensor representing the segmented body part.",
  "flows": "Input image -> Padding (if needed) -> get_segmentation_model() -> model inference -> extract specific segment -> return segment tensor.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or obfuscated code. Use of model_utils and enum appears standard. No data leaks or malicious code evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical image pre-processing (padding), loads a segmentation model, and produces an output tensor. The model loading is abstracted via get_segmentation_model() with no inline code or external network calls. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The code does not include any suspicious activities such as network communication, system modification, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard segmentation function for medical images, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It safely performs image padding, model inference, and extraction of the segmentation result.",
