  "purpose": "Perform body part segmentation from an X-ray image using a pre-trained segmentation model.",
  "sources": "Input image tensor; get_segmentation_model() function call; part enum value.",
  "sinks": "Output segmentation tensor of the specified body part.",
  "flows": "Image tensor is padded if necessary -> get_segmentation_model() loads model -> model inference -> output shape validation -> extract specific body part segmentation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior; reliance on external model loading function; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image pre-processing (padding), loads a segmentation model via an external utility, runs inference, and extracts a specific body part segmentation. No malicious activity, network communication, or obfuscation is present. The external function get_segmentation_model() could be a concern if malicious, but within this snippet, it appears trusted. The output shape assertion and straightforward logic indicate a benign routine. The scores from reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with this analysis. The main potential risk hinges on the external model utility, but no evidence suggests malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward medical image segmentation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
