  "purpose": "Wrapper around Google Gemini AI for file upload and content generation with input validation and environment-based API key management.",
  "sources": "Environment variable GEMINI_API_KEY, file_path parameter in upload_file, contents parameter in generate_content",
  "sinks": "genai.upload_file response.uri, model.generate_content response.text",
  "flows": "API key loaded from environment -> upload_file validates file existence -> uploads file -> generate_content validates input -> generates content",
  "anomalies": "Fixed mime_type='image/jpeg' in upload_file; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper that loads secrets securely, validates inputs, and interacts with external APIs properly. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Error handling is appropriate. The fixed mime_type could limit flexibility but does not introduce security risks. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious intent or supply chain vulnerabilities. The minor concern about fixed mime_type does not impact security. The scores are justified and accurate.",
