  "purpose": "Medical diagnostics and treatment support using AI, image analysis, and report generation.",
  "sources": "File system for image paths, external GeminiAI API for uploading files and generating content.",
  "sinks": "External API calls (upload_file, generate_content) transmitting patient data and images.",
  "flows": "Input validation -> Image existence check -> Image processing -> Upload images to GeminiAI -> Construct prompt -> Send prompt to GeminiAI for content generation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. External API usage appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation, processes images, uploads images to an external AI service, and constructs prompts for medical report generation. It does not contain obfuscated code or malicious logic. External API interactions are typical for cloud-based AI applications. No evidence of malicious activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is present. The security risk is low, primarily due to external data handling, but this is standard for such applications. The malware score is zero, as no malicious code or behavior is detected. The obfuscated score is zero, indicating straightforward code. The overall security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal external data handling risk without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate medical AI assistant module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. External API interactions are standard and do not indicate malicious activity. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
