{
  "purpose": "This code provides a healthcare AI that can answer patient questions and analyze X-ray images for diagnostic support.",
  "sources": "User input questions, image byte data, optional symptoms, and file uploads to external API (gemini.upload_file).",
  "sinks": "Generated content output, uploaded file URIs, temporary files created locally, and API calls to external services.",
  "flows": "Input questions are processed and sent to the Gemini AI for responses; images are processed, analyzed, and results integrated into prompts sent to Gemini; uploaded images' URIs are used in prompts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious dynamic code execution; external API interactions are standard; no obfuscated code features; temporary files are properly cleaned up after use.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard AI-based healthcare question answering and image analysis, utilizing external APIs (Gemini AI and image processing). It handles input validation, image processing, and external communication securely. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident. All file handling and external API interactions appear to serve legitimate purposes within the application's scope. The code does not contain any malware or obfuscation features. The only external dependencies are documented APIs and image processing libraries, which are typical for such applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate healthcare AI module with proper input validation and standard external API use. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or harmful behaviors. It is a well-structured application focused on medical diagnosis and patient communication, with no suspicious activities detected.",
