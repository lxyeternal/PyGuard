{
  "purpose": "This is a setup configuration script for a Python package named 'AFG_Gumball', intended for processing medical X-ray images and AI-based diagnosis.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata (name, version, description, author info, URL, dependencies, classifiers, Python version requirements, and package data inclusion flags). It does not read external input or user data at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the script does not handle untrusted data or perform any output or network operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external inputs; the script solely defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present. The code is standard for Python package setup and contains no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It does not include any code that reads external input, executes dynamic code, or interacts with untrusted sources. All dependencies are standard Python packages from PyPI, and the metadata appears consistent with common package distribution practices. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The dependencies listed are common for AI/medical imaging projects, and there are no unusual or suspicious entries.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script appears safe, standard, and free of malicious intent. It is a typical package configuration file with no evident security risks or malicious behavior.",
