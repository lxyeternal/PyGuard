{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'AFG_Gumball' for distribution, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Input data from package metadata fields such as name, version, description, author, email, URL, and dependencies in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through author_email and URL; no direct sinks for untrusted data execution; dependencies are standard.",
  "flows": "Metadata sources are static; dependencies are specified explicitly; no dynamic data flow or external input handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of standard packaging functions and dependencies; no obfuscated code or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup configuration using setuptools, specifying package info, dependencies, and classifiers. No user input, network calls, or code execution based on external data. Dependencies are typical for a scientific Python package. No signs of malicious behavior or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks observed. It follows standard practices for package distribution.",
