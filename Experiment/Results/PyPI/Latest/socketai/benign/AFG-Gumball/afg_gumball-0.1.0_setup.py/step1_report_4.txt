{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'AFG_Gumball', intended for processing medical X-ray images and AI diagnosis.",
  "sources": "Input sources include package metadata (name, author, email, URL), dependencies listed in 'install_requires', and package inclusion patterns.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the installation of external dependencies, package data inclusion, and the URL that may be used to download additional code or resources.",
  "flows": "The setup process reads package information and dependencies (sources), which are used during package installation to fetch dependencies and include package data (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. All code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code uses 'setuptools' to define package metadata, dependencies, and package data inclusion. Dependencies are explicitly listed with version constraints. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The URL points to a GitHub repository, which is typical for open-source projects. The email provided is a typical contact email. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are observed. The script functions solely as a package configuration, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
