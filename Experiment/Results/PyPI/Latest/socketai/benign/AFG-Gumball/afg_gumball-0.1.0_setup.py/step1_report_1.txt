{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package called 'AFG_Gumball', intended for processing medical X-ray images and AI-based diagnosis.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are explicitly read within this script; it primarily specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sink operations are present; the script does not perform any data output, network communication, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the script only contains setup metadata and dependency declarations.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup configuration using setuptools for packaging a Python project. It specifies package info, dependencies, classifiers, and metadata. No external input handling, network operations, or system modifications are present. All dependencies are typical for machine learning and image processing projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The structure is straightforward and adheres to common Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script for a Python package. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, and the dependencies listed are standard for the described project purpose. Overall security risk is minimal.",
