{
  "purpose": "A standard Python package setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata such as name, version, author, email, URL, and dependencies specified in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; dependencies are installed but not executed or used within this script.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; the script only declares package info and dependencies without dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It contains static metadata, dependencies, and classifiers, with no dynamic or malicious code. All dependencies are typical for an AI/medical imaging project. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by multiple reports, which correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.0 to 0.1).",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
