{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer that imports specific AI classes from local modules and exposes them via the __all__ list for external use.",
  "sources": "Local module imports from gemini_client, patient_ai, doctor_diagnostic_ai, doctor_enhance_ai, xray_analysis_expert_ai",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks are present; the code only imports and exports classes",
  "flows": "Imports from local modules, then exposes classes through __all__; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward module setup with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module that imports classes from local modules and exposes them via __all__. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or insecure code. The structure is typical for package initialization, with no external data flows or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning high confidence and zero malware, obfuscation, or security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup for exposing AI classes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to scores are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
