{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an __init__.py file that imports several AI class modules for a larger project, likely to organize and expose these classes for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module files gemini_client, patient_ai, doctor_diagnostic_ai, doctor_enhance_ai, and xray_analysis_expert_ai via import statements.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing classes from local modules and listing them in __all__, with no data processing or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and standard; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs are present. It merely re-exports classes.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as an initializer or package interface, importing specific AI classes from sibling modules and exposing them via __all__. There is no data handling, user input, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. It follows typical Python package structure without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks. It appears to be a normal package __init__ file intended for organizing exports.",
