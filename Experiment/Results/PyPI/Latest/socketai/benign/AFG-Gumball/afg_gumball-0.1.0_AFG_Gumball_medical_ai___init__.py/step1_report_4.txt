  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports and re-exports several AI classes related to medical diagnostics and analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local module files: gemini_client, patient_ai, doctor_diagnostic_ai, doctor_enhance_ai, xray_analysis_expert_ai.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; it does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes from local modules and exposes them via __all__, with no data flow from external sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or unusual language features. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements and an explicit list of exported classes, serving as an index or API module. It does not contain any data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution. No malicious or suspicious patterns are detected. The structure is standard for Python modules aiming to organize and expose classes.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code. It functions as a simple module that re-exports classes from other modules for external use.",
