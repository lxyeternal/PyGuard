  "purpose": "The code exports a set of AI class modules for use in other parts of a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .gemini_client, .patient_ai, .doctor_diagnostic_ai, .doctor_enhance_ai, .xray_analysis_expert_ai.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data, network communication, or data leakage in the provided code.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and defines an __all__ list, facilitating module exports; no data flow or source-to-sink paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that re-exports classes from local files for organized access. There are no external data inputs, network communications, or runtime data processing shown. It adheres to standard Python module practices. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detectable in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module setup for organizing and exporting class references. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions solely as an interface for other modules.",
