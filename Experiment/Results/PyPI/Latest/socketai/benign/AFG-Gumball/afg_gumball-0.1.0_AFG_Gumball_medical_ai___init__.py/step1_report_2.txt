  "purpose": "This code is for module exports, importing specific AI classes for use in other parts of the application.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules: .gemini_client, .patient_ai, .doctor_diagnostic_ai, .doctor_enhance_ai, .xray_analysis_expert_ai",
  "sinks": "Export list __all__ that exposes the imported classes",
  "flows": "Import statements load classes from local modules; __all__ exposes these classes for external use",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs; all imports and exports are straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports AI classes from local modules and defines __all__ for module exports. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no external network activity. It appears to be a standard module export pattern without malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module import and export pattern for Python, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
