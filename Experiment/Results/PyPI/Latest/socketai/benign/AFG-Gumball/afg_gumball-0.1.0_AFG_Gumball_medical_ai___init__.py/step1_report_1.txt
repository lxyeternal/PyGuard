{
  "purpose": "Defines and exports a list of AI classes for use in other modules, likely part of an AI or medical application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.gemini_client, .patient_ai, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external data output is observed.",
  "flows": "Imports from local modules, then exports class names for external use; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; purely standard module export structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several classes from local modules, which are then included in the __all__ list for controlled exposure. There is no dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated content. The pattern suggests a typical module setup for exposing multiple AI classes. No malicious or maliciously suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export file, listing AI classes for external use. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
