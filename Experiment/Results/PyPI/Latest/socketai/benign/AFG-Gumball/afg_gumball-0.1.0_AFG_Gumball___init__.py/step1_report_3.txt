{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python module that imports two submodules, 'xray_processing' and 'medical_ai', and specifies them in the __all__ list for exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads only its own module metadata and imports submodules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports module names.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing local modules and defining __all__ for module exports. It does not process input, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data. No suspicious patterns or malicious code behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module initialization script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
