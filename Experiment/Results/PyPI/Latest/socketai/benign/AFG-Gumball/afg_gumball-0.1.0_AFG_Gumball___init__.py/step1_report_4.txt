{
  "purpose": "This code imports two modules, 'xray_processing' and 'medical_ai', and exports them as public API components.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules within the package",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; simply imports and exports modules",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward module imports and defines the __all__ list for export. It does not include any dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The simplicity suggests it is likely a typical package __init__.py file with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a module initializer that exports two submodules. No malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security concerns are evident.",
