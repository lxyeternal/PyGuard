{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific submodules ('xray_processing' and 'medical_ai') and exposes them via the __all__ variable, likely for use in a larger project.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported submodules 'xray_processing' and 'medical_ai'.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions, as no untrusted data or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable; the code simply imports modules and defines an exported list.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "analysis": "The script only imports two modules and defines an __all__ list for exports. It does not execute any code with untrusted input, perform network operations, or manipulate data. The use of relative imports suggests it is part of a package structure. No anomalies or malicious patterns are evident in the code provided.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import and export statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger project structure without any suspicious behavior.",
