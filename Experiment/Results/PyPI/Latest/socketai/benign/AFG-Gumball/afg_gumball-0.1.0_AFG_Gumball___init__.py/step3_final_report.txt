{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, importing local modules 'xray_processing' and 'medical_ai' and exposing them via __all__ for external access.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only imports local modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows involving untrusted data or external sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard package initialization pattern, importing local modules and defining __all__. It contains no dynamic behavior, network activity, or data processing. The structure is typical for a benign module declaration. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or near-zero) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report appears to be an overestimation given the simplicity and safety of the code, and should ideally be lowered to 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module declaration with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
