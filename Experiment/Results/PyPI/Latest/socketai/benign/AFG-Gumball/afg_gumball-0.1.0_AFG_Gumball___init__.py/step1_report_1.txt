{
  "purpose": "This code exports modules 'xray_processing' and 'medical_ai' for external use, likely as part of a larger package related to medical imaging and AI processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module imports and the __all__ list declaration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks is evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two local modules and explicitly exports them via __all__, indicating an organized package structure. There are no external inputs, no network operations, and no data manipulation or processing that could introduce security issues. It appears to be a standard module definition with no malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module declaration that exports specific submodules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this snippet.",
