{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for medical record enhancement and diagnosis validation using an external AI service (GeminiAI).",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as medical_record, symptoms, pathologies_list, and data embedded into prompts.",
  "sinks": "The external GeminiAI.generate_content function, which receives prompt data for processing.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated, formatted into prompts, and sent to GeminiAI.generate_content; responses are returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. Data privacy concerns exist due to external data transmission but are typical for such applications.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation and constructs prompts for an external AI API, with no malicious payloads or obfuscation. The external GeminiAI module's trustworthiness is assumed. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or backdoors are present. The security risk score reflects minimal concern, primarily due to external data handling. Malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero given code clarity and lack of malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward wrapper for AI-based medical record processing. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The security risk is low but non-zero due to external data transmission. Overall, the code appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
