  "purpose": "This code provides a medical AI tool with functionalities to enhance medical records and validate diagnoses, utilizing an external GeminiAI for content generation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: medical_record, symptoms, pathologies_list. Data generated internally: prompts for GeminiAI.",
  "sinks": "Output: generated content from GeminiAI. No other sinks such as network, file, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (medical_record, symptoms, pathologies_list) is used to construct prompts, which are then sent to GeminiAI for content generation; no data is processed or transmitted beyond this.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or hidden behavior detected. The code appears straightforward, primarily preparing prompts for a language model.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a class with methods to enhance medical records and validate diagnoses by constructing detailed prompts. It relies on an external GeminiAI module to generate content based on these prompts. There are no signs of data leakage, network connections beyond the GeminiAI call, or malicious code. The input validation appears standard. No suspicious obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a medical AI assistant that interfaces with an external content generation service. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
