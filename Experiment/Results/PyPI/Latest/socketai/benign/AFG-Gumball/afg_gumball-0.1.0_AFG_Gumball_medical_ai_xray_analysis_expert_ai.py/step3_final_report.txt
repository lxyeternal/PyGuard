  "purpose": "Analyzing Python code for supply chain security, malicious behavior, and security risks in a medical image analysis application that interacts with external AI services.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from disk, uploads images via GeminiAI.upload_file, generates prompts, and processes responses from GeminiAI.generate_content.",
  "sinks": "Uploads files to external API, receives JSON responses, and parses them to extract diagnosis and recommendations.",
  "flows": "Input image validation -> file upload via API -> prompt creation -> API response -> JSON extraction and validation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard input validation, external API interactions, and JSON parsing. No malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms are present. External API usage raises privacy considerations but does not indicate malicious intent. JSON extraction via string slicing is fragile but not malicious. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for medical image analysis using external AI services. No malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior is detected. The security risk is low, primarily related to data privacy in external API interactions. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior.",
