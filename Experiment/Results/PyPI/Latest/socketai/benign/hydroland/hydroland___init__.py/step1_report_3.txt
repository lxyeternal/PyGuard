  "purpose": "The code imports the __version__ attribute from a local module and defines it as the only public attribute of the module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._version",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "Import from local module -> setting __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple version declaration and export",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a version string from a local module and exposing it. There are no input sources from external data, no data sinks that could leak data, nor any flow that could lead to vulnerabilities. The structure is straightforward and typical for version management in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration module with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
