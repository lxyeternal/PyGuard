  "flows": "Imports __version__ from the local module, then exposes it via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is minimal and standard for version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a version string from a local module and declares it as part of the public API. No data processing, external network calls, or suspicious logic present. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python package versioning.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely to define and expose the package version. There are no malicious behaviors, no anomalies, and no security risks identified.",
