  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a straightforward import and export of a version string from a local module `_version`.\n   - The original code is minimal, with no external inputs, outputs, or complex logic.\n   - No suspicious or malicious activity is indicated or implied by the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their description.\n   - They correctly identify the code as a standard pattern for version declaration.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is a simple import/export of version info, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The reports correctly assign a score of 0, indicating no security concern.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, file manipulation, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they recognize the code as standard boilerplate.\n   - No unwarranted security concerns are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard pattern for exposing version information.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Based on all reports and the code itself, I concur with the scores of zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n- I would also assign a risk score of 0, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the code's characteristics.",
