  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code simply imports `__version__` from a local module `_version` and exposes it via `__all__`. The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows common Python packaging practices. There are no inputs, outputs, or external interactions, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**  \n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the description and appears correct.  \n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence or suspicion of malicious code, backdoors, or malware.  \n- **Obfuscation:** The code is not obfuscated; it is clear and simple.  \n- **Security risks:** No external data handling, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**  \n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, which aligns with the code's benign nature.  \n- `obfuscated: 0` is appropriate given the code clarity.  \n- `securityRisk: 0` is justified since there's no indication of security issues.  \n- Confidence scores are 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions**  \n- The reports assume the `_version` module is benign. While this is generally safe, if `_version` were malicious or compromised, the import could be problematic. However, based solely on this code snippet, there's no evidence of that.  \n- The reports do not consider the content of `_version`. If `_version` is malicious, then this code would indirectly import malicious data, but there's no way to determine that from the current snippet.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment & Recommendations**  \n- The code is a standard pattern for exposing version info.  \n- No anomalies, suspicious activity, or security risks are evident.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard code)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward version declaration pattern with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
