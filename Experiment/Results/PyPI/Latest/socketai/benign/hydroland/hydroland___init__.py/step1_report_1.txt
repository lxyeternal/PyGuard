  "flows": "N/A; code only assigns and exports version information",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; simple import and export statements, no suspicious or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a local module '_version' and makes it publicly accessible via __all__. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no network or file operations. It appears to be a standard version declaration typical in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version information module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
