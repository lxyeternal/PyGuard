{
  "purpose": "The code imports the __version__ attribute from a local module and exposes it as part of the package's public API.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module ._version to get __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the local module ._version to the __all__ list, which exposes __version__ as public API.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for version management; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a local module, which is typical in Python packaging. The __all__ variable controls what is exported when the package is imported. No external data input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior are observed. The code is straightforward and appears to be standard boilerplate for version handling.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is simple and adheres to common practices for exposing package version information.",
