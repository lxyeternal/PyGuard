  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The original code is a minimal Python module that imports `__version__` from a local `_version` module and exposes it via `__all__`.\n   - All reports confirm that the code is straightforward, standard, and contains no suspicious or malicious logic.\n   - There are no anomalies, no external data handling, no network or file operations beyond the import, and no signs of obfuscation or malware.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify the code as benign and typical for version management.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `securityRisk` = 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all evidence points to benign, straightforward code, there's no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly interpret the code without making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - The code is standard boilerplate for version exposure.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a typical, benign version declaration module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Score |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Malware            | 0      |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      |\n| Security Risk      | 0      |\n\n**Final recommendation:** No concerns. The code is safe and standard.",
