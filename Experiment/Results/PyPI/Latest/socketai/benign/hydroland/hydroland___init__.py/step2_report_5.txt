  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code content and functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a minimal, standard pattern for exposing a package's version information.\n   - The code imports `__version__` from a local module `_version` and exposes it via `__all__`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external data handling, or network operations.\n   - The code structure is straightforward and typical for Python packages.\n\n2. **Potential issues or anomalies:**\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or signs of obfuscation are reported.\n   - The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, external data processing, or data leaks.\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n3. **Scores and their appropriateness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - Since there's no malicious activity, the malware score should remain 0.\n   - Obfuscation is not present; the code is clear.\n   - Security risk is negligible given the context.\n\n4. **Claims about vulnerabilities:**\n   - The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No assumptions are made that could lead to false positives.\n\n5. **Overall assessment:**\n   - The code is a boilerplate version declaration, common in Python packages.\n   - No signs of malicious intent, malware, or obfuscation.\n   - The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the evidence, I agree with the provided scores. The code is a straightforward, benign version declaration with no security concerns.\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
