{
  "purpose": "Expose the package's version information by importing __version__ from a local module and making it publicly accessible.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._version import __version__",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions",
  "flows": "Import of __version__ from _version module; exposure via __all__",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is minimal, straightforward, and follows standard practices",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a local module and exposes it via __all__, with no external inputs, outputs, or dynamic behavior. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The code is a common boilerplate for version management, with no signs of obfuscation, network activity, or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which are consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for exposing version information in a Python package. There are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
