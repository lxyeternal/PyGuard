  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no functions, imports, external data reads, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is standard for package versioning and contains no malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the benign nature of the code, with no logical flaws or reasoning errors.\n   - No issues are found in the analysis or conclusions.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (correct)\n     - `malware`: 0 (correct)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (correct)\n   - The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No reason exists to assign a higher risk score because there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware`: 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly identify the code as a standard version declaration.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Given the code's simplicity, no further scrutiny or suspicion is warranted.\n- All reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward version string assignment, standard in Python packages, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
