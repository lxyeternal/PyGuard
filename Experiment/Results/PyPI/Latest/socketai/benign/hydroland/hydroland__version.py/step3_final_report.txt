  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ attribute for package versioning.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns a static string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to __version__, with no input/output, dynamic code, or external interactions. It is a common pattern in Python packages. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The code's simplicity and clarity support a malware score of 0, security risk score of 0, and obfuscated score of 0. The high confidence score of 1 is justified due to the unambiguous benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward assignment, and the scores reflect this assessment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
