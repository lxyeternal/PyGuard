The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and the malware score remains at 0. The code's operations are controlled and predictable, with boundary checks ensuring safety. Overall, the script poses minimal security concern and functions as intended for routine cleanup."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent scientific workflow management script for hydrological modeling. While it employs subprocess calls with 'shell=True' and dynamic command strings, these practices are acceptable in controlled environments. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary security consideration is to ensure inputs remain sanitized if sourced externally. Overall, the code poses a low security risk with no malware detected."
