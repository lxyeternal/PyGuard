  "purpose": "Hydroland data pre-processing and PET estimation for hydrological modeling, involving file matching, parallel data preparation, and external function calls.",
  "sources": "Input files matching glob patterns based on date and variable suffixes, read by external functions.",
  "sinks": "External functions (`prepare_data`, `get_pet`) potentially process data; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "File matching → parallel processing with `prepare_data` → PET estimation with `get_pet`.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard file handling, parallel processing, and external function calls typical for scientific workflows. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. Error handling is appropriate. External functions are presumed safe; no network activity or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward data processing pipeline with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. External dependencies should be reviewed separately, but based on this code alone, it is secure.",
