{
  "purpose": "The script prepares hydrological forcing data by processing temperature and precipitation NetCDF files and estimating PET for a specified date range.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments, input files matching specific glob patterns in the raw data directory.",
  "sinks": "Calls external functions (get_pet and prepare_data) which may process or generate output files; no direct sinks evident in the script.",
  "flows": "Command-line input → file pattern matching → parallel data preparation via prepare_data → PET estimation via get_pet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or obfuscated code. Uses standard libraries and external functions presumed safe. No malicious data exfiltration, network activity, or system disruption observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily orchestrates data processing tasks, matching input files via glob, launching parallel processing with ProcessPoolExecutor, and calling external functions for data preparation and PET calculation. It includes error handling for missing input files and exceptions during processing. All code appears to be typical for scientific data workflows with no indicators of malicious intent or suspicious activity. No code injections, data leaks, or network communications are present within this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard scientific data processing script with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It operates within expected parameters for data file handling and parallel processing without any indication of sabotage or malware.",
