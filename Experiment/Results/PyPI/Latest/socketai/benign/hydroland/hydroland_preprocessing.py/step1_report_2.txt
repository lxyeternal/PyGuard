{
  "purpose": "The script prepares hydrological forcing data by locating, processing, and estimating evapotranspiration data from raw NetCDF files, then saving processed files for further hydrological modeling.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the filesystem using glob.glob and direct file path matching in find_file(). It also reads parameters from command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output files (NetCDF) for temperature, precipitation, and PET data to a specified directory. No untrusted data sinks or external network communications are present.",
  "flows": "Input file patterns are matched to locate files; these are passed to prepare_data() for processing. Processed data are saved as new files. The get_pet() function further processes data to produce PET files. Data flows from input filesystem reads to output filesystem writes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious string manipulations. Use of multiprocessing for parallel data processing is standard; no hidden or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs file matching, data processing via imported functions, and parallel execution for data preparation. It uses standard Python libraries and practices. Error handling is implemented via logging and sys.exit() upon missing files or exceptions. No suspicious code, external network access, or malicious payloads are detected. Functions like prepare_data() and get_pet() are imported and assumed to be standard or benign, with no suspicious behavior visible in this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data processing script with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs file matching, data processing, and output generation as intended for hydrological data preparation. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious payloads are identified.",
