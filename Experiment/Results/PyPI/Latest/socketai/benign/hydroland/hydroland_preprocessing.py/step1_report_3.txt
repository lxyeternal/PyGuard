  "purpose": "This script prepares hydrological forcing data files for a specific modeling workflow, including data fetching, processing, and parallel execution.",
  "sources": "Input arguments from command line, glob patterns for file matching, external library functions such as get_pet and prepare_data.",
  "sinks": "External functions (get_pet, prepare_data) potentially process or generate data; file operations and sys.exit() for error handling.",
  "flows": "Command line input -> file pattern matching -> data preparation functions -> output files; parallel data processing flows from matched files to output files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network calls, no unusual obfuscation or dynamic code execution, standard use of subprocess pools. Logging is typical. No hidden or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages data input/output operations, pattern matching, and parallel processing. It validates file existence before proceeding and uses external functions for processing. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Usage of sys.exit() upon errors is standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious code constructs are present. The functions and variables are straightforward and purpose-driven.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard data processing utility for hydrological modeling, with no indicators of malicious or sabotage behavior. All code flows and external function calls are typical for data pipelines.",
