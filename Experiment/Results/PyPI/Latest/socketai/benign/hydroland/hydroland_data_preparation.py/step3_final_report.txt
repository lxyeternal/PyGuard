{
  "purpose": "The code performs hydrological data processing, including PET calculation, dataset manipulation, and file I/O, primarily for climate and hydrological modeling workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads input datasets via xarray from NetCDF files, timestamps, variables, and dataset attributes.",
  "sinks": "Writes processed datasets to NetCDF files; no network activity or external command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Loads datasets -> performs calculations (PET, attribute copying, dataset cloning) -> writes output datasets.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard scientific libraries and practices for dataset handling, parallel PET computation, and dataset attribute management. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscation are present. The parallel PET calculation employs ProcessPoolExecutor safely. Dataset manipulations like cloning, timestamp resetting, and attribute copying are straightforward and typical for such workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate hydrological data processing pipeline with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It performs standard operations, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
