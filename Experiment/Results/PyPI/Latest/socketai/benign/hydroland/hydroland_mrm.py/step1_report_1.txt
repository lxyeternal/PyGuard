{
  "purpose": "The script orchestrates data preparation, execution of a multi-domain hydrological model (mRM), merging outputs, and managing restart and log files for hydrological simulations.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments, environment variables, and file system paths for data input, output, and configuration.",
  "sinks": "Writes to file system locations for logs, restart files, and merged output files; executes external processes including the mRM executable.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> environment variables and file paths -> data preparation functions -> external model execution -> output merging -> file management (move/delete logs and restart files).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or uncommon language features; environment variable usage is limited to thread count setting; file operations are standard; no network communications are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages workflow orchestration for hydrological model runs, including data prep, process execution, and file handling. External executable 'mhm' (default) is invoked, but its code is not included. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are detected. The script employs standard Python modules and functions. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code injections, or malicious behaviors are observed. The only potential concern could be the execution of external commands, but this is typical for orchestration scripts and is controlled via parameters and environment variables. Overall, the script appears to be a legitimate, well-structured workflow manager without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard hydrological workflow orchestration script with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It securely manages files, invokes external processes responsibly, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code segments. Its malware score is low, and security risks are minimal but should be monitored for external executable integrity.",
