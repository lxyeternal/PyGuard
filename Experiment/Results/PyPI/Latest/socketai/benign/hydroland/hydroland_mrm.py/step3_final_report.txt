  "purpose": "This script orchestrates hydrological modeling workflows, including data preparation, parallel execution of external processes, merging outputs, and managing restart and log files.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, environment variable 'OMP_NUM_THREADS', input directories for data and forcing files, external executable scripts invoked via imported modules.",
  "sinks": "File system locations for restart files, log files, output flux files, and temporary data; external processes executed via subprocess calls.",
  "flows": "Input arguments and environment variables set parameters; external modules generate argument lists; external executables run in parallel; files are moved, merged, and permissions set; logs and restart files are managed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. External process invocation is standard for scientific workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured workflow orchestrator relying on external modules and executables typical in scientific modeling. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. File operations and environment variable usage are standard. External executable integrity should be verified, but nothing suspicious is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, transparent workflow orchestrator with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation, and minimal security risk (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the detailed review.",
