  "purpose": "Orchestrates hydrological model (mHM) execution, managing input data, symbolic links, restart files, and post-processing.",
  "sources": "Input forcing files, restart files, environment variables, external executable",
  "sinks": "External mHM binary execution, file moves, symlinks, data preparation functions",
  "flows": "Reads forcing data -> sets environment variable -> creates symlinks -> runs external binary -> moves restart files -> calls data prep functions",
  "anomalies": "High thread count setting (OMP_NUM_THREADS=640) is unusual but not malicious; no secrets or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard orchestration tasks for a hydrological model, with straightforward file handling, subprocess execution, and environment setup. No suspicious network activity, secrets, or obfuscated code are detected. The high thread count is notable but not malicious; it could be a performance setting. External functions are assumed benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is low (~0.1-0.2) due to the environment variable setting. Overall, the code is transparent and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, transparent orchestration tool for hydrological modeling with no malicious intent or security risks. The only unusual aspect is the high thread count environment variable, which does not constitute a security threat. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
