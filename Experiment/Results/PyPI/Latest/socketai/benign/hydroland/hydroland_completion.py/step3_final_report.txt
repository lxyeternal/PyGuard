  "purpose": "The script processes date-based files and optionally deletes files in specified directories, avoiding deletion on boundary days of the month.",
  "sources": "Filename patterns matching date-based files in various directories, including restart logs, main logs, forcing files, hydroland OPA files, and subdomain-specific restart/log files.",
  "sinks": "os.remove() and shutil.rmtree() calls deleting files and directories matching patterns.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments → date parsing → pattern matching with regex → deletion functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors; straightforward pattern matching and file deletion.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard cleanup utility that deletes files matching specific date-based patterns in multiple directories, with boundary checks to prevent deletion on critical boundary days. It uses predictable filename patterns and safe deletion methods. No network activity, credential handling, or obfuscation is present. The boundary logic correctly avoids deleting files on first, last, or second-last days of the month, reducing risk of accidental data loss. The command-line interface and pattern matching are simple and controlled. The code's behavior is transparent and predictable, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, well-structured maintenance utility for cleaning up date-organized files. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and the malware score remains at 0. The code's operations are controlled and predictable, with boundary checks ensuring safety. Overall, the script poses minimal security concern and functions as intended for routine cleanup.",
