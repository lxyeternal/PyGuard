{
  "purpose": "The script processes date-related files in specified directories, optionally deleting certain files based on date boundaries.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments for dates and directory paths; reading files via glob patterns for deletion.",
  "sinks": "File system operations such as os.remove() and shutil.rmtree() which delete files/directories based on matching patterns.",
  "flows": "Input arguments → parse_dates and directory patterns → identify files matching patterns → conditional deletion based on date boundary logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual dynamic code execution observed. The pattern matching is straightforward and focused on filenames with date patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code parses input arguments for dates and directories, then calculates month boundary days to avoid deleting files on boundary dates. If deletion is enabled, it constructs specific glob patterns to target files related to restart logs, main logs, forcing files, hydroland OPA files, and subdomain-specific restart/log files, then deletes them unless the date is on a boundary. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or malicious payloads. The file operations are limited to deleting files matching predictable patterns, with no network activity or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate utility for managing and cleaning up date-organized files, with no malicious intent detected. It carefully avoids deleting files on boundary days, aligning with typical data management practices. No indicators of malware or malicious behavior are present.",
