{
  "purpose": "The script processes date-based files and directories for cleanup, optionally deleting files outside month boundaries to manage disk space and organization.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments (dates, directory paths, flags); filesystem glob patterns for matching files and directories.",
  "sinks": "File and directory removal functions (shutil.rmtree, os.remove) that delete matched files/directories based on patterns and date logic.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are parsed; dates are processed to determine boundary days; patterns are constructed to match files; matching files/directories are deleted if conditions are met.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The removal operations are based solely on file naming conventions and date calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate cleanup based on date logic, with pattern matching for files to be deleted. It avoids deleting boundary days and logs actions. No external network activity, credential handling, or code execution is present. The only potentially sensitive operation is file deletion, which is controlled by command-line flags. No malicious or backdoor behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard file cleanup utility based on date logic, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on the filesystem, with well-defined patterns and safeguards to prevent deletion on boundary days.",
