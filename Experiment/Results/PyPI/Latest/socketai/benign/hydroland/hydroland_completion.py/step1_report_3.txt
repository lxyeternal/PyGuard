  "purpose": "The script processes date-based files and optionally deletes certain files outside of month boundary days.",
  "sources": "Input arguments for dates and directory paths; glob patterns for files to delete.",
  "sinks": "File and directory removal functions (shutil.rmtree and os.remove).",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> parse_args -> cleanup_files -> remove_matching -> os.remove/shutil.rmtree",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code. The code relies on standard libraries and glob patterns; no obfuscation detected. The deletion logic appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code parses date inputs, computes month boundary days, and deletes files matching certain patterns unless on boundary days. It includes functions for argument parsing, date normalization, and file cleanup with logging. The removal operations are based solely on filename patterns and directory paths provided as arguments. There are no indications of malicious data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors. The deletion commands are explicitly controlled via user input (--delete-files). No suspicious code execution, network calls, or credential handling present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard file cleanup script based on date logic. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. Its operations are limited to file deletion within specified directories based on date patterns. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
