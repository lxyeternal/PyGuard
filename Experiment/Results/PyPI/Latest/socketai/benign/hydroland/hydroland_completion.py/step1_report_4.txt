{
  "purpose": "The script processes date-based files in specified directories, optionally deleting files that are not on month boundary days.",
  "sources": "Input parameters from command-line arguments (dates, directory paths, flags).",
  "sinks": "File deletion functions (os.remove, shutil.rmtree) that delete matching files and directories based on patterns.",
  "flows": "Parsed command-line arguments → date parsing → boundary day calculation → pattern matching in directories → deletion of files/directories, if --delete-files is set.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code. Use of regex to parse filenames appears straightforward; no obfuscated or misleading variable names. The code performs file deletion based on date patterns but no evident malicious logic or hidden data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard libraries and methods for parsing arguments, handling dates, and deleting files. The removal functions target specific file patterns based on dates, and the code checks boundary days to avoid deleting critical boundary files. No code injection, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code logic is consistent with intended cleanup operations and does not contain hidden or malicious routines. It is a straightforward file cleanup utility with safe use of functions and no suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate file cleanup operation based on date logic with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It safely manages file deletions with proper boundary checks. No malware or malicious behavior is detected.",
