{
  "purpose": "The script processes date-based files in various directories, with an optional feature to delete files except on specific boundary days, likely for cleanup or maintenance tasks.",
  "sources": "User-provided command-line arguments for dates and directory paths; glob patterns for file matching based on date prefixes.",
  "sinks": "File removal operations (os.remove, shutil.rmtree) triggered by matching patterns; potential deletion of files across multiple directories.",
  "flows": "Arguments parsed from CLI → date parsing and boundary calculation → pattern matching → file deletion if --delete-files is set.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. Use of regex for date extraction is straightforward. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs file cleanup based on date patterns, with logic to skip deletion on boundary days of the month. It uses safe, standard library functions for file operations. The pattern matching is based on predictable naming conventions, and no user input is executed as code. There are no indications of malicious intent such as data theft, network activity, or backdoors. The code's behavior aligns with maintenance tasks, not malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate cleanup script for file management based on dates. There are no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It operates only within the file system using provided inputs, with no suspicious network or data access activities.",
