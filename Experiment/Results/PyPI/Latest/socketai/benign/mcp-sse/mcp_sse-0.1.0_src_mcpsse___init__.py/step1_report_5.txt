  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific task, but without the actual code provided, the exact intent cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function arguments, or external data sources such as files or network connections.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, system commands, file writes, or data serialization points where untrusted data could cause harm or leak information.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input points) to sinks (output points) through various processing functions or data transformations.",
  "anomalies": "No specific anomalies can be identified without the code. Common anomalies include hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "Since the actual code was not provided, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. Typically, one would review source points, track data flow to sinks, and identify suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to definitively identify malicious behavior. No obvious signs of malicious intent or malware are visible without the code. Further review of the actual code content is necessary.",
