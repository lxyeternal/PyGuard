{
  "purpose": "This code provides a tool to query weather information from Baidu API based on administrative district codes, acting as a server-side service with asynchronous HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Environment variable BAIDU_API_KEY for API key; input parameter 'district_id' for district code",
  "sinks": "Response JSON data; error messages; HTTP response status",
  "flows": "Input 'district_id' → API request to Baidu weather API → JSON response → return data or raise exceptions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; environment variable used for API key; proper error handling; no suspicious code execution or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a server tool using MCP framework, which makes an asynchronous call to Baidu's weather API with a district ID and API key from environment variables. It handles errors properly and returns raw data as per MCP standards. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors observed. External libraries are used legitimately, and data flows appear typical for a weather API client. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate server tool for weather data retrieval, with proper use of environment variables for API keys and standard HTTP request handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
