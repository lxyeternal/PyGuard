{
  "purpose": "The code implements a weather query service that interacts with Baidu's weather API to fetch real-time weather and forecast data based on administrative district codes.",
  "sources": "Reads the environment variable 'BAIDU_API_KEY' for API authentication; accepts 'district_id' as an input parameter for weather requests.",
  "sinks": "Makes HTTP GET requests to Baidu API endpoint; processes and returns API responses; raises exceptions on errors.",
  "flows": "Input 'district_id' flows into the request parameters, which are sent via an HTTP request to Baidu API; response data is processed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no unusual or obfuscated code; the environment variable is used for API key, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a weather query tool within an MCP server framework, utilizing environment variables for API key security. It performs an asynchronous HTTP request to Baidu's weather API, handles responses and errors, and exposes a tool for external invocation. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are evident. Usage of environment variables for API key storage is standard and safe. The flow from input to API request and response processing appears normal and without obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a weather query service using Baidu's API, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It properly handles external API interactions and error conditions without suspicious patterns.",
