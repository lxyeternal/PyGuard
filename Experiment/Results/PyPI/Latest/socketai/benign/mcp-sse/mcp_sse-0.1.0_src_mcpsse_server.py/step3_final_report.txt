{
  "purpose": "Provides a tool within an MCP framework to query Baidu weather API based on district ID.",
  "sources": "Environment variable BAIDU_API_KEY, user input parameter 'district_id', external HTTP request to Baidu API",
  "sinks": "HTTP response handling, returning raw data, raising exceptions on errors",
  "flows": "Input 'district_id' -> API request with parameters -> Response processing -> Return data or raise error",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves API key from environment variables, constructs an asynchronous HTTP GET request to Baidu's weather API, handles errors properly, and returns the raw response data. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. Error handling is appropriate, and external libraries are used legitimately. The code's purpose is clear, and it does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured weather data retrieval tool with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. It uses environment variables for API keys, handles errors properly, and does not contain any suspicious code. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with its functionality. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for production use.",
