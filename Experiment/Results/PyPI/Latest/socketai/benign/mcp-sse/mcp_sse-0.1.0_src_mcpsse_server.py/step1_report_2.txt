{
  "purpose": "The code implements a service for querying weather data from Baidu API based on administrative district codes, and exposes this functionality via an asynchronous tool in an MCP server framework.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'BAIDU_API_KEY' for API key; input parameter 'district_id' from function arguments.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request to Baidu API with the API key and district_id; response processing and returning data.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'BAIDU_API_KEY' -> HTTP request (params include API key and district_id) -> Response handling -> Return data or raise errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; use of environment variable for API key is standard. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are found. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors. Error handling is straightforward and does not leak sensitive info beyond error messages.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a weather query tool that takes a district ID, constructs an API request to Baidu's weather service, and processes the response. It uses environment variables for API keys, proper async HTTP requests, and error handling. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be a standard service implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard weather data retrieval service with no malicious behavior detected. It securely retrieves API key from environment, performs legitimate API requests, and returns data without suspicious or harmful actions.",
