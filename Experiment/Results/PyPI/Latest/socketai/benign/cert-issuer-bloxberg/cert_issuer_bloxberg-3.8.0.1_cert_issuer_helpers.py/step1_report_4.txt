{
  "purpose": "The code manages certificate files, prepares directories for batch issuance, copies output certificates, and converts blockchain chain identifiers and transaction IDs into specific formats.",
  "sources": "Input certificates from the 'unsigned_certificates' directory; chain parameters passed to conversion functions.",
  "sinks": "Copying files from blockchain certificate files to final output locations; no other direct data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Certificate files are copied from source to temporary directories, then later copied to final locations. Chain identifiers and transaction IDs are converted to specific string formats.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external libraries like 'cert_core', 'pycoin', and 'glob2' appear standard. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Directory management appears standard; no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code handles file and directory management for certificates and performs chain ID conversions. It reads certificate files from a specified directory, prepares workspace directories, and copies certificate files for further processing. Chain and transaction ID conversion functions translate chain enums to string identifiers, with no apparent malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The functions are straightforward and serve standard operational purposes related to certificate issuance workflows.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard file management and data formatting tasks related to blockchain certificates. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The overall security risk appears low.",
