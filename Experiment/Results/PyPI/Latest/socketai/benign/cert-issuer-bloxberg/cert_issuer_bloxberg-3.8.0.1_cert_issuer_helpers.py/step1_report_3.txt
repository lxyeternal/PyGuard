{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to facilitate the preparation, management, and processing of certificate files for blockchain issuance, including directory setup, file copying, and chain identification.",
  "sources": "File system directories (os.listdir, glob2.iglob), environment variables are not used; no external input sources like network or user input are present.",
  "sinks": "File operations such as shutil.copytree, shutil.copy2, os.makedirs, and shutil.rmtree are used for copying, creating, and deleting files/directories.",
  "flows": "Input certificate files are copied from source directories to working directories, metadata is generated, and files are later copied to final locations; no data flows involve untrusted input beyond filesystem operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic detected. The code appears standard with no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly performs directory management, file copying, and data structuring for certificate issuance. No user input, network access, or external data fetching occurs, reducing attack surface. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code segments are present. Chain and transaction conversions are simple mappings with exception handling. No malicious behavior or malware-like activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation for managing certificate files and blockchain chain identification. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, nor does it contain malware or security risks. The code appears safe for use, with no indication of sabotage or security vulnerabilities.",
