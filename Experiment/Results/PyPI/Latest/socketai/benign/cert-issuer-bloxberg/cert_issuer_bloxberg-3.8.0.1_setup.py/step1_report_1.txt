{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup utility for installing the 'cert-issuer-bloxberg' Python package, managing dependencies based on blockchain selection, and defining command-line entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md, requirements.txt, ethereum_requirements.txt, bitcoin_requirements.txt; reading input via open() calls; environment variables indirectly through subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.check_call() used to execute pip install commands, which can install arbitrary packages.",
  "flows": "Requirements files are read and processed into installation commands, then executed via subprocess. No untrusted data flows into critical system calls without validation.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically installs packages based on user-specified options without validation, which could be exploited to install malicious packages. The 'run' method executes pip commands directly from requirements files, which could be manipulated if files are compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code reads dependencies from specified files and installs them via subprocess, which executes system-level commands. The user can specify a blockchain type, affecting which additional dependencies are installed. The script does not perform validation or sanitization on input files or parameters before installation. The use of subprocess with unvalidated input presents a security risk of remote code execution if the requirements files are compromised or manipulated.\n\nNo hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are detected. The core functionality relies on external files and user input but does not contain malicious logic itself.\n\nHowever, the approach of executing pip install commands from potentially untrusted files or user inputs can be exploited to execute malicious code or install malicious packages, especially if files are tampered with.\n",
  "conclusion": "The script primarily functions as a package installer with conditional dependency management. The main security concern is executing pip install commands based on external files without validation, which could be exploited to introduce malicious packages. There are no signs of malware or obfuscated code, but the lack of input validation creates a potential security risk.",
