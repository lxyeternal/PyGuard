  "purpose": "Setup script for installing the 'cert-issuer-bloxberg' package, reading dependencies from external files and executing pip installs via subprocess.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt', 'ethereum_requirements.txt', 'bitcoin_requirements.txt'; subprocess calls to 'pip install' with package names.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', package]) which executes package installations based on external files.",
  "flows": "External requirement files -> subprocess pip install commands -> system package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic; reliance on external files without validation introduces supply chain risk.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup utility that reads dependency lists from external files and installs them via subprocess calls. No embedded malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of external requirement files; if these are compromised, malicious packages could be installed. The code itself is benign, but the method of executing pip based on external, unvalidated files introduces moderate supply chain risk. The malware score is 0, as no malicious intent is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The security risk score is approximately 0.3, reflecting the potential for supply chain attack due to external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup utility with no malicious code or obfuscation. The main security concern is reliance on external requirement files that could be tampered with, leading to supply chain risks. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk≈0.3 are appropriate and justified.",
