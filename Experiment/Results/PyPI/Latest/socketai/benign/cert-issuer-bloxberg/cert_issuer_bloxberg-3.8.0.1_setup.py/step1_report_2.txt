  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'cert-issuer-bloxberg' that installs dependencies and defines custom installation commands.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md', 'requirements.txt', and optional requirement files ('ethereum_requirements.txt', 'bitcoin_requirements.txt').",
  "sinks": "Subprocess call to 'pip install' with potentially unvalidated package names from requirements files.",
  "flows": "Reading package list from files -> extending 'reqs' list -> passing 'reqs' to subprocess for installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to run pip install dynamically based on external files without validation, which could be manipulated. No hardcoded secrets or credentials detected. No suspicious network activity or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code reads package dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and optionally from 'ethereum_requirements.txt' or 'bitcoin_requirements.txt' based on user input. It then installs these packages using subprocess calls to pip, dynamically constructing the command. The process itself is straightforward and typical for setup scripts. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no evidence of malicious behavior or backdoors are present. However, executing pip install on files that can be altered externally introduces a potential supply chain risk if the requirement files are compromised. The code does not include any malicious network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration functions.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup utility with some potential supply chain risk if the requirements files are tampered with externally. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent within this code. The subprocess calls are a point to monitor, but on their own, they do not indicate malicious behavior.",
