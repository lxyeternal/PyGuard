  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, considering the code, the logic, and the potential security implications.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a setup utility for the 'cert-issuer-bloxberg' package.\n- It reads dependencies from static files ('requirements.txt', 'ethereum_requirements.txt', 'bitcoin_requirements.txt') based on user input.\n- It installs dependencies via subprocess calls to pip, executing commands dynamically.\n- It defines a custom command class for optional blockchain-specific dependency installation.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The process relies on external files, which if compromised, could lead to malicious package installation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code **does not** contain malicious code or malware.\n- It **executes pip install** commands based on external files without validation, which could be exploited if those files are tampered with.\n- No obfuscation or backdoors are present.\n- The code itself is straightforward and typical for setup scripts.\n\n### Flaws and Risks:\n- **Supply chain risk:** External requirement files ('requirements.txt', etc.) are trusted sources only if maintained securely. If an attacker compromises these files, malicious packages could be installed.\n- **No validation or sanitization** of package names before installation.\n- **Potential for remote code execution** if malicious packages are installed, but this depends on the content of the requirements files, not the script itself.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malware.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.4 — Moderate supply chain risk due to reliance on external files without validation. The script itself is benign, but external dependencies could be malicious if compromised.\n\n### Specific report review:\nAll five reports consistently highlight:\n- The use of subprocess to run pip install based on external files.\n- No malicious code or backdoors.\n- Potential supply chain risks due to external files.\n\nThey assign malware scores of 0 and obfuscated scores of 0, which I agree with.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard setup script.\n- The main security concern is external file integrity, not the code itself.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent or malware.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate | Justification                                                                                 |\n|-----------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score   | 0.0              | No malicious code or behavior detected.                                                   |\n| Obfuscated Score| 0.0             | Clear, straightforward code.                                                                |\n| Risk Score      | 0.4              | External dependency files could be compromised, posing supply chain risks.                |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe script is benign in itself but should be used with verified dependency files to mitigate supply chain risks. No signs of malware or obfuscation are present.",
