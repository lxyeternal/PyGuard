  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup utility with no malicious code or obfuscation. The main security concern is reliance on external requirement files that could be tampered with, leading to supply chain risks. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk≈0.3 are appropriate and justified."
