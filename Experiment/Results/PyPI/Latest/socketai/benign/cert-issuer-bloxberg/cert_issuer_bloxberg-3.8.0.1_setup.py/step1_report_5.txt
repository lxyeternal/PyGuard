{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to facilitate the installation of the 'cert-issuer-bloxberg' package and its dependencies, with options for specifying blockchain network types.",
  "sources": "File reads ('README.md', 'requirements.txt', 'ethereum_requirements.txt', 'bitcoin_requirements.txt') and input parameters ('blockchain' option).",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess.check_call for pip installation, potential for executing untrusted packages if 'requirements.txt' contains malicious entries.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'blockchain' influences which dependency files are read; these dependencies are then installed via subprocess calls, which could execute malicious code if the requirements files are malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of subprocess.check_call with dynamic package names from requirements files poses a risk if these files are compromised; no validation or verification of package sources is performed. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.",
  "analysis": "The code reads static files ('README.md', 'requirements.txt', plus optional 'ethereum_requirements.txt' or 'bitcoin_requirements.txt') to gather dependencies. It dynamically installs these dependencies using subprocess calls. The 'blockchain' parameter controls which set of dependencies are included, with validation to restrict options to 'bitcoin' or 'ethereum'. The installation process relies entirely on external files and direct pip installation without verification. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. The code uses standard modules and patterns for package setup, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs typical package installation tasks with dynamic dependency management based on user input. While it risks executing malicious packages if the requirements files are compromised, there is no evidence of malicious intent within this code itself. It appears to be a straightforward, legitimate setup script, assuming external dependency files are trustworthy.",
