{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the cert-issuer-bloxberg Python package, enabling installation and configuration with optional blockchain parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading files ('README.md', 'requirements.txt', 'ethereum_requirements.txt', 'bitcoin_requirements.txt'), user input via command-line options (blockchain), and subprocess calls to install packages.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing pip installs, reading requirement files, and command-line argument validation.",
  "flows": "Reading requirements files -> Extending install requirements based on blockchain choice -> Running subprocess to install packages based on final requirements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The subprocess installation method may be risky if untrusted packages are specified, but in context, it’s a standard package installation process. No obfuscated code, no hidden behaviors, or suspicious network connections.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard setup tasks, reading dependencies and installing them via subprocess. The command class allows selecting between 'bitcoin' and 'ethereum' by modifying requirements. No hardcoded secrets, no external data exfiltration, and no malicious logic. The subprocess call to pip install could be exploited if malicious packages are listed, but that risk is inherent in package installation processes and depends on external requirements files, not on malicious code within this script itself.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup file with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It uses common patterns for package setup and installation. While reliance on external requirements files could pose supply chain risks if those files are compromised, the script itself does not contain malicious logic.",
