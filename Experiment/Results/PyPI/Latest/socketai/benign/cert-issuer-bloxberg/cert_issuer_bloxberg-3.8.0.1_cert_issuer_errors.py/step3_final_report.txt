{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in blockchain or certificate management systems.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Error base class, no external data sources or input handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; purely structural definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static class definitions with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions with descriptive docstrings. It is static, with no external data input/output, dynamic execution, or malicious patterns. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The reasoning is consistent and accurate, with high confidence. No vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code serves as a standard error handling scaffold, typical in blockchain or certificate systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, non-malicious, and purely structural. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
