  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error conditions related to certificate issuance, transaction signing, verification, broadcasting, and chain recognition.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and string docstrings",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data input/output in this code",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only defines exception classes without data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected; standard exception class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base Error class. Each class has a docstring explaining its purpose, but no dynamic code, input handling, or external interactions are present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The classes appear to serve as structured error handling within a larger application context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for error handling. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation are detected. It appears to be standard, benign code meant to facilitate error management.",
