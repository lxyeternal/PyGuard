  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is solely defining custom exception classes with descriptive docstrings.\n   - The code is static, with no data input/output, no dynamic execution, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n   - There are no anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is purely definitional, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n   - No logical flaws are evident in the reasoning; the analysis is thorough and aligned with the code content.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1 or 1.0), reflecting certainty about the benign assessment.\n   - No adjustments are necessary for the scores.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely exception class definitions with no external interactions, dynamic code, or data handling, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious payloads are present.\n   - The security risk score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or attack vectors are evident.\n\n5. **Claims About Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes for error handling in a blockchain or certificate management system. There are no security concerns, malicious payloads, or obfuscation present.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all be 0.**",
