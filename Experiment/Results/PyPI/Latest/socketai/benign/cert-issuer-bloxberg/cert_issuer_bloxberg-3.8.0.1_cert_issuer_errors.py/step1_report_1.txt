  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a blockchain or certificate management system",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and docstrings, no data input or external data reading",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output actions, no untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or logic beyond class definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with descriptive docstrings and no unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions, inheriting from a base Error class. The classes include descriptive docstrings explaining their purpose. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors present. No external data sources, sinks, or flows are observed. The structure and content are typical for a structured error handling module in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, intended for error handling, and contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions.",
