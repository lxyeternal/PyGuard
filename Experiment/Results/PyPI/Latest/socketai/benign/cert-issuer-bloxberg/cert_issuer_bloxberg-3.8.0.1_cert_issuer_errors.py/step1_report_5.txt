{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a module related to certificates, transactions, and blockchain operations.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and docstrings, primarily static code with no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, I/O operations, or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are purely structural definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to common Python conventions for custom exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base Error class. Each class includes descriptive docstrings, indicating their purpose within a blockchain or certificate management context. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The structure is standard and serves to facilitate error handling in a larger application. No data leakage, malicious code, or malicious intent is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of standard custom exception classes intended for error handling. It contains no malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security concerns. It appears to be a benign component of a larger blockchain-related project.",
