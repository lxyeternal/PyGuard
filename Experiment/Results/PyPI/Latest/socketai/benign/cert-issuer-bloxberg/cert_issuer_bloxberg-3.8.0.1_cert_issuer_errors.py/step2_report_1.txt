  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify that the code only defines custom exception classes.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code is purely structural, serving as error handling scaffolding.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating strong agreement.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n- The code snippets are straightforward class definitions inheriting from a base Error class, with descriptive docstrings.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.\n- No evidence of vulnerabilities, backdoors, or security risks.\n- The purpose appears to be to facilitate structured error handling in blockchain or certificate management systems.\n\n**Assessment of Scores:**\n- Malware score: 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 is correct.\n- Risk score: 0 is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate; the code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or security-related issues.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Final note:**\n- No further action needed. The code is a typical, safe set of exception classes for error handling in a blockchain or certificate management context.",
