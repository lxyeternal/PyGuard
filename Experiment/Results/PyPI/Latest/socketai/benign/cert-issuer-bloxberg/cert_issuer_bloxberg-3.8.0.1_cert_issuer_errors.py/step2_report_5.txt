  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications, consistency of scores, and potential issues.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with descriptive docstrings.\n- No external data handling, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, and no signs of malicious activity.\n- The code appears to be a standard pattern for structured error handling in a blockchain or certificate management system.\n\n**Detailed Review:**\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is straightforward class definitions inheriting from a base Error class.\n   - No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or suspicious constructs.\n   - Confirmed that the code is purely definitional and safe.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes in the reasoning.\n   - The conclusions are consistent with the code content.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - Malware score: all reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated score: all assign 0, correct given the clarity of the code.\n   - Security risk: all assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5.\n   - This is appropriate, as the code is purely for error handling and contains no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - Correctly assigned as 0 across all reports.\n   - No malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear class definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the thorough analysis, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions with no security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is benign.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- No further action required.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a set of well-structured, standard custom exception classes for error handling in a blockchain or certificate management context. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns.",
