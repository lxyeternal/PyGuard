  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a certificate or blockchain-related module",
  "sources": "No external data sources, input, or data reading functions present",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; solely class and exception definitions",
  "anomalies": "Code consists only of class definitions inheriting from Exception with descriptive docstrings; no anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of custom exception classes with descriptive docstrings for various error conditions likely related to blockchain or certificate management. No external data handling, network operations, or security-sensitive code is present. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code patterns; the structure is straightforward and standard for defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for use within a larger application. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
