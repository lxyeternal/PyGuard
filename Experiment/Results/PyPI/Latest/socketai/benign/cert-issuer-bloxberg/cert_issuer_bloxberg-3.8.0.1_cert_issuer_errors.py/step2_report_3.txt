  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions with descriptive docstrings.\n   - No external data handling, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n   - The code appears to be a standard implementation of exception classes, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying that the code is purely definitional and safe.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The reasoning that these are benign exception class definitions is sound.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty about the benign assessment.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which aligns with the conclusion that there's no malicious or risky behavior.\n   - The scores are justified given the absence of dynamic code, data leaks, or malicious patterns.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious intent.\n   - The code does not perform any suspicious actions such as network access, code execution, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed without evidence.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the analysis.\n   - The high confidence and zero malware/security risk scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, safe set of custom exception classes with no indication of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It is typical for error handling in a blockchain or certificate management system.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese are consistent with the detailed analyses provided in all reports.",
