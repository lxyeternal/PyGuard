{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a module related to certificate and transaction management",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines exception classes without input or data reading",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output occurs within these class definitions",
  "flows": "None; no source-to-sink data flow as the code only contains class definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward class definitions with descriptive docstrings",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions inheriting from a base Error class, each representing specific error conditions likely related to blockchain or certificate operations. There are no input sources, data sinks, or flow control mechanisms. The code contains no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. It appears to be a standard pattern for structured exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a clean set of custom exception class definitions with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate component for structured error management within a larger application.",
