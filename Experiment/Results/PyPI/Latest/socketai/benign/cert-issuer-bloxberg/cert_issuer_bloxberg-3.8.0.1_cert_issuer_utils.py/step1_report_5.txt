{
  "purpose": "The function computes the intersection of two arrays, returning elements common to both.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leakage or security effects; no external or untrusted data handling outside the parameters.",
  "flows": "Elements from 'b' are checked for presence in 'a' to produce the intersection list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected. No hardcoded secrets or unusual language features present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function to find common elements between two lists using filter and lambda. It performs a straightforward intersection without any external data sources, network calls, or security-sensitive operations. The code structure is standard, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. It does not manipulate or leak data beyond the scope of the inputs and outputs, and there are no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for list intersection with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is straightforward and safe.",
