{
  "purpose": "The function computes the intersection of two arrays by filtering elements in 'b' that are also in 'a'.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' which are used within the filter function to check membership.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or security effects; the code only processes data in-memory without external I/O.",
  "flows": "Elements in 'b' are checked for membership in 'a'; the result is a list of common elements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and uses standard Python constructs without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function that filters 'b' to include only elements also present in 'a'. It uses 'filter' with a lambda function for membership testing. There are no hardcoded secrets, external data reads, or suspicious constructs. The logic is typical for array intersection and does not include any malicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of array intersection with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It performs basic in-memory data processing without external interactions or suspicious patterns.",
