  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**  \n   The provided code:\n   ```python\n   def array_intersect(a, b):\n       return list(filter(lambda x: x in a, b))\n   ```\n   is a straightforward implementation of list intersection. All reports confirm that it performs a basic intersection operation without any anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, external data leaks, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   The reports uniformly describe the function as a simple, safe utility. No logical errors are identified, and the reasoning aligns with the code. The analysis is consistent and accurate.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n   The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, and given the code's simplicity and safety, this is appropriate. The code does not perform any external operations, network access, or data leaks.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis provided. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple, well-understood list intersection function with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The uniform agreement across reports supports this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score |\n|------------------|--------------|\n| Malware          | 0            |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            |\n| Security Risk    | 0            |\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscating elements.**",
