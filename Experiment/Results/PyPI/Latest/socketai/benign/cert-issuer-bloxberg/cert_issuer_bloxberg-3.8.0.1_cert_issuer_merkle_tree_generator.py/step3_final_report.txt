  "purpose": "Constructs a Merkle Tree from data, generates cryptographic proofs, encodes proofs for blockchain anchoring, and provides blockchain data.",
  "sources": "Reads byte arrays from node_generator, retrieves Merkle root, and proof data from MerkleTools.",
  "sinks": "Outputs blockchain-compatible Merkle root bytes and proof encodings; logs proof JSON data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from node_generator to hash, then to Merkle Tree; proofs are generated per leaf; proofs are encoded and yielded; Merkle root is returned as blockchain data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard cryptographic libraries to build a Merkle Tree, generate proofs, and encode them for blockchain anchoring. It uses common patterns without obfuscation or malicious logic. Logging is benign. No network calls or secrets are present. The cryptographic operations are straightforward and correctly implemented. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cryptographic implementation for Merkle Tree construction and proof generation, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero. The low risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects the cryptographic nature but does not indicate vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
