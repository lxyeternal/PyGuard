{
  "purpose": "The code assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, serving as a package version declaration.",
  "sources": "No data sources; static assignment within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data flow.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment of version string.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual version format '3.8.0.1' but not suspicious; no obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string, common in Python packages. No inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors are involved. The version string's format is slightly unconventional but not indicative of malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code poses no security threat and is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
