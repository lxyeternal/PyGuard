  "analysis": "The code solely assigns a version string to the __version__ variable. There are no inputs, no processing, and no data handling. This is a common pattern in Python packages for versioning. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present in this simple assignment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a typical version declaration. No malicious intent or security issues are evident.",
