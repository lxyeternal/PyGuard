  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module.",

  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual version format with four numeric segments; no clear indication of malicious intent but atypical versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a string '3.8.0.1' to the variable __version__, which is common in Python packages to specify version info. There are no inputs, outputs, or data handling beyond this static assignment. No malicious behavior or suspicious patterns are evident. The version string's unusual format could be a minor anomaly, but it does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, serving solely as a version indicator. No malicious or security concerns detected.",
