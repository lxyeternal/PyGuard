{
  "purpose": "The code handles creation, normalization, proof addition, and batch processing of certificates, likely for blockchain issuance and verification.",
  "sources": "File reads for unsigned certificates, JSON data loaded from files, configuration inputs, and proof data; external helper functions for file operations and batch preparation.",
  "sinks": "Writing JSON data to files, normalization functions, proof addition functions, and logging outputs.",
  "flows": "File input reads -> JSON loading -> proof generation -> certificate normalization -> proof addition -> file write; batch processing involves validation, signing, proof generation, and data output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no use of unsafe functions; no obfuscated code; no suspicious network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors evident; no embedded malicious behavior or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement a certificate issuance and batching system with proper file handling, validation, signing, and proof management. It uses external helper modules for batch preparation and copying outputs. All data operations are file-based or logging-based, with no indications of malicious network activity or secret theft. The presence of proof handling and blockchain data suggests a focus on secure, auditable issuance. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The code seems to follow standard practices for batch processing and certificate management without security risks or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. It appears to be a legitimate implementation of certificate handling and blockchain batch processing without evidence of sabotage or malware.",
