{
  "purpose": "This script manages the issuance of certificates on blockchain networks, supporting Ethereum and Bitcoin, by orchestrating handlers and issuing transactions.",
  "sources": "Reads system information (Python version), configuration data from 'config.get_config()', and blockchain handler instantiation data.",
  "targets": "Calls to 'Issuer.issue()', blockchain handler methods, and logging functions.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from 'config.get_config()' to 'main()', then to blockchain handler instantiation and 'issue()' method; transaction ID is logged or errors are recorded.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic. Environment variable usage appears standard. No obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment checks, loads configuration, and dynamically imports blockchain handlers based on the chain type. It then orchestrates certificate issuance through a defined 'Issuer' class, with proper error handling and logging. The code uses standard libraries and external modules in a typical manner, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious payloads. There are no suspicious data flows or suspicious external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation for blockchain certificate issuance with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses external modules and handles errors appropriately. No malicious signals or security risks are evident.",
