{
  "purpose": "This script orchestrates the process of issuing certificates on a blockchain, supporting both Ethereum and Bitcoin, and manages configuration, logging, and flow control.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from 'config.get_config()', blockchain type from 'app_config.chain', and uses data from 'certificate_batch_handler' and 'transaction_handler'.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'issuer.issue()' which interacts with blockchain via 'Issuer' class, and logs transaction IDs or errors.",
  "flows": "Source: 'config.get_config()' -> app_config -> 'main()' -> blockchain handler instantiation -> 'issue()' -> 'Issuer.issue()' -> blockchain network; also logs transaction ID.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes configurations, verifies Python version, dynamically imports blockchain handlers based on chain type, and executes certificate issuance via the 'Issuer' class. It handles exceptions and logs outcomes. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration are evident. The process appears straightforward and consistent with typical blockchain transaction workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard application script for issuing blockchain certificates. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks based on the provided snippet. It performs expected operations securely.",
