{
  "purpose": "This code manages the process of issuing certificates on a blockchain, supporting Ethereum or Bitcoin, including configuration loading, blockchain handler instantiation, and transaction issuing.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data via 'config.get_config()', input parameters 'app_config', and blockchain-specific handler instantiation functions.",
  "sinks": "Logging functions for transaction IDs and errors, method calls for issuing transactions, and potential external blockchain connections (via 'instantiate_blockchain_handlers').",
  "flows": "Configuration data is loaded from 'config.get_config()' (source), which is then used to instantiate blockchain handlers and perform transaction issuance (sink). The 'issue' function interacts with blockchain handlers to perform operations that could involve external network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. The code appears straightforward and consistent with its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script verifies Python version compatibility, loads configuration, and invokes blockchain-specific handlers to issue a certificate transaction. It uses standard logging and error handling. The blockchain handler instantiation is dynamic based on the chain type, and there are no indications of data leakage, malicious code, or unauthorized system access. External communication depends on the blockchain handler implementations, which are imported dynamically but not shown here. Overall, the code performs typical certificate issuance operations with standard security practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and intended for blockchain-based certificate issuance. No malicious behavior or supply chain threats are evident. The structure and logic are typical for such applications, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or data leaks.",
