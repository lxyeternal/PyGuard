{
  "purpose": "This code orchestrates blockchain certificate issuance by dynamically selecting blockchain handlers based on configuration, initializing an issuer, and managing transaction flow.",
  "sources": "Configuration object (app_config), external blockchain handler modules, 'Issuer' class, sys.argv inputs",
  "sinks": "Issuer.issue() method, external blockchain modules, logging outputs",
  "flows": "Config is read and passed to main(), which imports the appropriate blockchain handler, then to 'issue()' where handlers are used to perform batch actions and issue certificates, culminating in transaction ID logging",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual control flows detected",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment version check, dynamically imports blockchain-specific modules based on configuration, initializes handlers, and issues certificates via the 'Issuer' class. External modules are trusted but could pose supply chain risks. Error handling is broad but standard. No malicious patterns or secrets are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and relies on external dependencies for core functionality, which is typical in such applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of external modules, which is outside the scope of this review. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and security risk is low (0.2) due to external dependency trust considerations. Overall, the code is secure and well-structured.",
