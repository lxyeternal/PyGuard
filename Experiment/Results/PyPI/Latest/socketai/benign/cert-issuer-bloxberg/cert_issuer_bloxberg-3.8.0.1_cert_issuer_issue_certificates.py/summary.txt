  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of external modules, which is outside the scope of this review. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and security risk is low (0.2) due to external dependency trust considerations. Overall, the code is secure and well-structured."
