{
  "purpose": "The code facilitates issuing certificates on a blockchain, supporting Ethereum and Bitcoin, by initializing handlers, performing pre- and post-batch actions, and issuing transactions.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from 'config.get_config()', input from command-line execution, and possibly external blockchain modules.",
  "sinks": "The 'issuer.issue()' function likely interacts with the blockchain, potentially sending transactions. Logging outputs are for information display.",
  "flows": "Configuration is obtained and parsed, then passed to 'main', which initializes blockchain handlers based on chain type, then proceeds to issue certificates via the 'issue' function, culminating in transaction execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code structures. External modules ('cert_issuer.issuer', 'blockchain_handlers') are imported dynamically based on chain type, but this is expected behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard blockchain transaction issuance procedures with proper version checks. It uses external modules for blockchain interaction, with no evident obfuscation or malicious patterns. No untrusted data flows into sensitive operations without validation. Exception handling and logging are straightforward. The code does not contain any suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation for blockchain-based certificate issuance. No malicious or sabotage behavior is evident. The code follows best practices and does not include suspicious patterns or malicious activity.",
