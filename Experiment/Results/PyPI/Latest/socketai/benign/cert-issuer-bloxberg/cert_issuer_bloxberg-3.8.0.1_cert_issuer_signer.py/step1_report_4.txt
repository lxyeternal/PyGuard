{
  "purpose": "This code manages secrets stored in files, checks internet connectivity, and controls the flow of secret management operations.",
  "sources": "Reads secret data from a file specified by 'secrets_file_path'; checks internet connectivity via HTTP requests to google.com.",
  "sinks": "Reads secret data into memory; potentially blocks execution based on internet and USB status; prints status messages.",
  "flows": "Reads secret from file -> Checks internet connectivity -> Waits for specific network/USB conditions based on user prompts.",
  "anomalies": "Uses an infinite loop with no timeout in 'check_internet_off' and 'check_internet_on'; prints status messages to stdout without logs, which could be suppressed; no validation of the secrets file content or its location; no encryption or obfuscation of secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages secret loading and environment checks. The 'import_key' function reads secrets from a provided file path, which could pose security issues if the file path is manipulated or if secrets are stored insecurely. The internet check functions rely on HTTP requests to determine network status, with indefinite loops that could cause denial of service if conditions are never met. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden code is evident. The code could be used maliciously if an attacker controls the secret file path or network conditions to cause delays or leaks, but as-is, it does not contain malicious payloads or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard secret management and environment control utility with no evident malicious intent. The use of infinite loops and reliance on external network conditions could be considered security risks or usability issues but do not constitute malware. No malicious behavior or sabotage is detected.",
