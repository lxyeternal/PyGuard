{
  "purpose": "The code manages secrets by reading from a file and performs network connectivity checks to control operational flow, ensuring the environment is suitable for secret handling.",
  "sources": "File read operation in import_key(), network requests to 'http://google.com' in internet_on(), filesystem existence checks for USB presence in check_internet_off() and check_internet_on().",
  "sinks": "Reading secrets from a plaintext file; network requests to google.com; print statements for user prompts.",
  "flows": "import_key() reads secrets; internet_on() checks connectivity; check_internet_off() and check_internet_on() loop until conditions are met; main flow depends on network/file status to proceed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of infinite loops with sleep in check_internet_off() and check_internet_on() without timeouts; plaintext secrets storage; reliance on network connectivity as a security measure; print statements instead of logging.",
  "analysis": "The code reads secrets from a file without encryption, performs benign network connectivity checks, and uses blocking loops that could cause operational delays or DoS. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The infinite loops could be exploited for denial-of-service, but there is no evidence of malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. Security concerns are limited to operational issues rather than malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a secret management utility with environment checks. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is the potential for operational denial-of-service due to blocking loops, but no malicious activity is detected.",
