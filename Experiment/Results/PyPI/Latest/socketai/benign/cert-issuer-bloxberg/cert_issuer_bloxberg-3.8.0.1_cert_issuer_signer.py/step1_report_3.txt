  "purpose": "Manage and secure access to secrets stored in files, with checks for internet connectivity status to control security environment conditions.",
  "sources": "File reading in import_key, checking existence of secrets file with os.path.exists, network status via requests.get to google.com.",
  "sinks": "Reading secret key from file, printing status messages, network requests to external domain.",
  "flows": "import_key reads secret from file; check_internet_off/on repeatedly check network status; external requests to google.com influence flow control.",
  "anomalies": "None of the code shows obfuscated techniques or suspicious dynamic code. Usage of sleep loops for network checks is common but could be used maliciously if misconfigured.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages secrets stored in local files and checks internet connectivity via external HTTP requests. It includes functions for waiting on network conditions with user prompts, which is standard for environment setup but can be misused for persistent delays. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network activity is detected. The use of requests to google.com is benign but could be exploited for denial-of-service if abused. Overall, the code's behavior appears aligned with environment management, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs environment and secret management with network checks, without signs of malicious behavior. No malware, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are detected. It appears to be a legitimate utility for managing secure secrets based on network status conditions.",
