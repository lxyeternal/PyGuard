  "purpose": "Manage secrets using file-based storage with internet connectivity checks for security.",
  "sources": "Reading secrets from a file at a specified path, checking internet connectivity via HTTP request.",
  "sinks": "Reading secret key data from a file, network request to google.com.",
  "flows": "import_key reads from secrets file -> check_internet_off/check_internet_on check internet status -> network request to google.com -> control flow based on internet status and file existence.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; the loop waits for specific conditions which could be misused for denial of service or blocking, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles secret management via reading from a file and performing internet connectivity checks. The functions 'check_internet_off' and 'check_internet_on' repeatedly poll network status and file existence, pausing execution with sleep. The 'import_key' reads secret data from a given file path. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, malicious code injection, or backdoors. The network requests are benign (pinging google.com), and the control flow enforces environmental conditions before proceeding. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected; the code is intended for operational security, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard secret management utility with environment checks. No malicious behavior, malware, or suspicious anomalies identified. It is consistent with intended security practices.",
