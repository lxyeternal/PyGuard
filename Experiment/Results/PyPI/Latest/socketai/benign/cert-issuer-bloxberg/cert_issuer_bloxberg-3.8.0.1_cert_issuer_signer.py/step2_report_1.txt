  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the findings, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code primarily manages secrets by reading from a file, with network connectivity checks to control operational flow.\n- The network checks involve simple HTTP GET requests to google.com, which are benign.\n- The functions `check_internet_off` and `check_internet_on` use infinite loops with sleep delays, which could be misused for denial-of-service but are not malicious per se.\n- No obfuscated or malicious code is present.\n- Secrets are read directly from files without encryption or validation, which is a security concern but not malware.\n- No data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident.\n- The code relies on manual user prompts, which is benign but could be inconvenient.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious payloads or malware.\n- The only potential security concern is the use of blocking infinite loops that could cause denial-of-service or operational delays.\n- Secrets are handled insecurely (plain text), but this is a security best practice concern, not malware.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- Use of infinite loops without timeout or exit conditions could be exploited for DoS.\n- No validation or sanitization of secrets read from files.\n- Reliance on internet connectivity as a security measure is weak; network availability can be manipulated.\n\n### Scores and their justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with clear code.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher (0.2-0.3), reflecting operational issues rather than malicious intent.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores seem reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n- The risk scores are low because there's no malware or malicious activity, only potential operational issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.2** (consistent with minor operational concerns)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward secret management utility with environment checks. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation. The main issues relate to operational blocking loops and insecure secret handling, but these do not elevate the risk to malicious activity.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign with some operational security concerns, but no malware or malicious intent detected.",
