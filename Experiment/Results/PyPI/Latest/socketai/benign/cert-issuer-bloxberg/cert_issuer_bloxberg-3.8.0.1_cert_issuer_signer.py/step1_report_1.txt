{
  "purpose": "Manage secrets by reading from a file, with network checks to ensure security conditions during start/stop processes.",
  "sources": "File reading in import_key(), network connectivity checks via requests.get(), and os.path.exists() for USB presence.",
  "sinks": "Reading secret key from file; printing messages for user prompts.",
  "flows": "import_key() reads secret from file; check_internet_off/on() depend on internet status; start() and stop() invoke these checks based on safe_mode.",
  "anomalies": "Use of infinite loops with time.sleep() for network state checks; no validation or sanitization of secrets read from file; reliance on internet connectivity as a security measure; no encryption or secure handling of secret key file.",
  "analysis": "The code reads secret keys directly from a specified file without encryption or validation, which could lead to exposure if the file is compromised. The functions check_internet_off/on repeatedly poll network state via requests.get() and os.path.exists() for USB presence, using blocking loops that can be abused for Denial of Service by causing infinite waits. There is no evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network communications outside expected operations. The only external network activity is a GET request to google.com to verify internet connectivity, which is standard. The printing of prompts to the user is benign but indicates reliance on manual user actions. Overall, no malicious intent or malicious behaviors are detected, but security best practices are not followed due to the use of blocking loops and potential exposure of secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve as a secret manager with network state checks to enhance security. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or malware characteristics. Its main security concern relates to blocking loops that could cause denial-of-service conditions, but there is no indication of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
