  "purpose": "Unit testing for the serialization functions of the whitespacesv.serializer module.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to test functions, specifically the 'value', 'values', 'whitespaces', and 'comment' variables.",
  "sinks": "Assertions that compare the output of serialization functions to expected strings.",
  "flows": "Test inputs are passed to serialization functions which produce outputs checked against expected values; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments detected. The code strictly performs test assertions on serialization functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports test libraries and serialization functions, then defines multiple parameterized test cases to validate serialization behavior with various inputs, including None, empty strings, and special characters. The tests verify correct output formatting and handling of whitespace and comments. No external data sources, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is straightforward test code meant for validation purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard test code for serialization functions with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code performs expected assertions without side effects or malicious intent.",
