{
  "purpose": "Defines a class WsvLine representing a line in a whitespace-separated values (WSV) document, including validation for whitespace and comments.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in __init__ method: values, whitespaces, comment; static validation methods for whitespaces and comment.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; code mainly performs validation and object representation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> validation methods -> object attributes; no external data flows or untrusted data outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Validation functions ensure no non-whitespace characters in whitespace sequences and no line feeds in comments. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles data encapsulation for a line in a WSV document with validation for whitespace and comments. It uses type hints, static validation methods, and property accessors. There are no external data sources, network operations, or execution of untrusted data. Validation functions perform simple checks to prevent malformed data. The class does not perform any I/O, dynamic code execution, or include suspicious behavior. The use of type hints and validation functions appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data container with input validation for whitespace and comments, containing no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It adheres to good practices for data validation without any suspicious or malicious code components.",
