{
  "purpose": "The WsvLine class models a line in a WSV (Whitespace-Separated Values) document, handling values, whitespaces, and comments with validation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the constructor (values, whitespaces, comment).",
  "sinks": "No sinks found that handle untrusted data or perform data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters through validation methods, stored internally, and used in representation and equality checks.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs validation to prevent non-whitespace characters in whitespace and line feeds in comments, which are standard safety checks. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. No network, file, or environment variable access detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for representing and validating WSV lines, with methods to validate whitespaces and comments, ensuring no non-whitespace characters or line feeds are included where inappropriate. The class's methods and properties follow best practices, and there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The validation functions serve to enforce data integrity rather than security threats. No external or internal data flows indicate malicious intent or supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data model with validation for WSV lines. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and well-structured with proper input validation.",
