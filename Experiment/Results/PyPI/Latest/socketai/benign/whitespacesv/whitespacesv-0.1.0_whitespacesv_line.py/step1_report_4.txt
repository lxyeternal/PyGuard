  "purpose": "The WsvLine class models a line in a WSV (Whitespace-Separated Values) document, managing its values, whitespaces, and optional comment.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in __init__ method (values, whitespaces, comment), is_string_whitespace function call for validation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is being directed to external systems or sensitive areas.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and stored internally; no data flows to external systems or insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors observed. Validation methods ensure whitespaces are whitespace-only and comments lack line feeds, which are standard data integrity checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with basic data storage, validation, and comparison methods. It validates input to prevent invalid whitespace characters and line feeds in comments. No user input is processed dynamically, nor are external systems accessed. There are no indications of obfuscated or malicious code. Use of type annotations and validation functions enhances data integrity. The code appears straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard data structure implementation with input validation. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code. The validation methods are typical safeguards. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
