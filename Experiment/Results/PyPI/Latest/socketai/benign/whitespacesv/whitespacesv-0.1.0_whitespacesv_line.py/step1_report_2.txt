{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to define a class WsvLine that models a line in a whitespace-separated values (WSV) document, including its values, whitespaces, and optional comment.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the constructor parameters: values, whitespaces, and comment, which are provided during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or security issues. No functions write untrusted data to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor inputs through validation methods and into internal attributes. No untrusted data is processed for security-sensitive actions such as network communication or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs validation of whitespace and comment fields, ensuring no non-whitespace characters or line feeds are present. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are present. The use of type hints and static methods is standard. No hardcoded secrets or external data sources are detected.",
  "analysis": "The class focuses on modeling data with validation checks on whitespace and comment fields to prevent malformed lines. Validation functions ensure whitespace contains only whitespace characters and comments do not contain line feeds, which are reasonable constraints for parsing WSV data. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as code injection, network access, or data theft. The code structure is clean and adheres to typical data modeling patterns. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. Overall, the code appears purely functional and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data model with validation routines for a WSV line. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. It appears safe and well-structured for its intended purpose.",
