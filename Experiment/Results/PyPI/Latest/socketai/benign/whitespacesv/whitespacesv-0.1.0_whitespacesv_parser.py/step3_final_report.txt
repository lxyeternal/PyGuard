  "purpose": "Parsing WSV (Whitespace Separated Values) data into structured lines.",
  "sources": "Input text processed by WsvCharIterator, reading characters, whitespace, comments, and values.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Input text -> WsvCharIterator -> _parse_line -> WsvLine object; no external data flow or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward parsing functions with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard parser for WSV data, utilizing a custom iterator to process input text into structured WsvLine objects. It performs simple string and character processing with clear control flow. No network activity, code injection, or external interactions are present. The functions handle input safely, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The minimal security risk stems from processing untrusted input, but the code itself does not introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward parser with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
