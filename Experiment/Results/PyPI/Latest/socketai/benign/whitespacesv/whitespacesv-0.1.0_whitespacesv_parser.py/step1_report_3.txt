  "purpose": "This module parses WSV (Whitespace Separated Values) data into structured objects.",
  "sources": "Reads input text in the 'parse_lines' function and 'iterator' object reads characters and substrings via 'WsvCharIterator' methods.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable sink is 'iterator.read_string()', 'iterator.read_value()', 'iterator.read_comment_text()', which process untrusted input data; no other evident sinks.",
  "flows": "Input text -> WsvCharIterator methods (reading characters, whitespace, comments, values) -> _parse_line and related functions -> WsvLine object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of character iteration and comment parsing appears standard. No network, file operations, or external calls observed. No dynamic code execution or malicious obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines parsing functions for a whitespace-separated format, relying on a character iterator. Input data is read via the iterator with functions designed to parse values and comments. The flow is linear, from input string to tokenization to constructing WsvLine objects. No suspicious operations such as network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code are present. The functions perform standard parsing tasks, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward parser for WSV data with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard parsing techniques with no evident backdoors, data leaks, or malicious operations.",
