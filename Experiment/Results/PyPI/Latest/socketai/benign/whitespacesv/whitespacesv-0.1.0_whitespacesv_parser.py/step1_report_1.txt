{
  "purpose": "Parse WSV (Whitespace Separated Values) lines from text input.",
  "sources": "Input string `text` in `parse_lines`, input data from `WsvCharIterator` methods such as `try_read_char`, `read_string`, `read_value`, `read_comment_text`, `read_whitespace_or_null`, and `is_end_of_section`.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from `read_string`, `read_value`, and `read_comment_text` functions, stored in variables, and ultimately encapsulated in `WsvLine` objects.",
  "flows": "Input text -> `WsvCharIterator` reads characters -> `_parse_line` extracts values, comments, whitespace -> `parse_lines` aggregates lines.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The functions operate on input data with no side effects or network activity. No eval, exec, or unsafe code execution detected. No obfuscated code or hidden payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs line-by-line parsing of text input into structured `WsvLine` objects. It utilizes a custom iterator for character processing, with functions dedicated to parsing values, comments, and whitespace. The parsing logic appears standard and straightforward, with no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections, or system modification. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The functions are tightly focused on input processing and data structuring. Overall, the code seems safe and purpose-specific, with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard parser for WSV data with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It processes input text into structured lines without executing or transmitting data outside its scope.",
