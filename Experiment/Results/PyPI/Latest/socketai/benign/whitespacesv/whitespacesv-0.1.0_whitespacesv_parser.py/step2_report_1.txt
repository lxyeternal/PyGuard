  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious code; functions are straightforward parsing routines.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0 — reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** Completely benign, standard parser with no security concerns.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard parsing logic, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0 — low risk, justified by the parsing of untrusted input.\n- **Assessment:** No issues; minor security risk score (0.1) is acceptable given the input processing.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no suspicious code, no external interactions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1 — consistent.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior; parser functions are safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a straightforward parser with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No security issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar benign parser, no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1 — acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious activity—no network, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, and the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0 or 0.1), reflecting the input parsing nature and lack of external side effects.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured parser for WSV data.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The small risk scores (0.1) are reasonable given the input processing, but could be set to 0 for even more conservative security stance, considering no external interactions.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk beyond standard input parsing.\n\n**Summary:** The code appears safe, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The existing scores are appropriate and align with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No modifications needed. The code is a benign parser with standard input handling.",
