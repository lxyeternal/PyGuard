  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing whitespace, comments, strings, and handling errors in WSV documents.",
  "sources": "Reads from the '_chars' list of character codes, string inputs, and pandas DataFrame serialization/deserialization.",
  "sinks": "Internal data processing; no external data sinks or network communication.",
  "flows": "Source characters are processed within functions to identify whitespace, comments, or string content; no external data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, secrets, obfuscation, or external communication detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides parsing utilities with functions to identify whitespace, read comments, parse strings, and handle errors. It uses standard exception handling and internal data processing. The pandas-based type inference is safe and common. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or external system interactions are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical parsing utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of parsing utilities with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is appropriately low (~0.1). The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
