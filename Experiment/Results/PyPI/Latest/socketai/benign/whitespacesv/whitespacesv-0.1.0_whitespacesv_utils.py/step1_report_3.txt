  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing and handling whitespace, comments, and strings in a whitespace-separated values (WSV) document, including custom exceptions and type inference for dataframes.",
  "sources": "Input data from string parameters in functions like is_string_whitespace, contains_string_special_chars, and get_string; data read from internal _chars list in WsvCharIterator; external data from pandas DataFrame in reinfer_types.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any direct data sinks such as writing to files, network, or system commands. No data leakage or untrusted data handling beyond internal processing.",
  "flows": "Input strings are converted to ordinal lists; functions process these to determine whitespace, special characters, or extract substrings. WsvCharIterator reads from internal character list, handling parsing of strings and values. reinfer_types serializes and deserializes DataFrames.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code mainly handles parsing and data processing. The presence of detailed exception handling and type inference appears standard. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs parsing and utility operations related to whitespace, comments, and string handling in WSV documents. Functions are straightforward, with no network calls, system modifications, or suspicious data handling. Exception class provides contextual info for parsing errors. WsvCharIterator provides methods for navigating and extracting parts of the character stream, with careful handling of string parsing and whitespace detection. The reinfer_types function serializes and deserializes pandas DataFrames to infer types, which is standard practice. Overall, no malicious behavior or supply chain threats are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for parsing WSV documents, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It handles data safely and internally without external data leaks or harmful operations. No indicators of malware or security risks are present.",
