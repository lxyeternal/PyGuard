  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing and handling whitespace, comments, and errors in WSV (Whitespace Separated Values) documents.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from strings and character iterators, primarily in methods like 'read_comment_text', 'read_string', 'read_value', and 'is_ord_whitespace'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include string manipulation, exception raising, and data conversion functions. No untrusted data is directly sent to external systems or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "Input data from character iterators or strings flows into parsing functions which process whitespace, comments, and string values, but no dangerous or external operations are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution. No network or file system access is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs parsing operations on whitespace and text, with custom exception handling for parse errors. Functions are focused on reading and interpreting characters and strings, with no external system interactions. There are no signs of malicious logic such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system manipulation. The code's complexity and structure appear consistent with a safe utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for parsing whitespace-delimited data with robust error handling. No malicious behavior, security risks, or malware are evident. It functions as intended without harmful side-effects.",
