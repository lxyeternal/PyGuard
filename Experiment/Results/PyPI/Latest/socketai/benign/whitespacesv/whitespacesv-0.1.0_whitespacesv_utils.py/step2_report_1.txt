  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code's logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; utility functions for parsing WSV, reading characters, and handling whitespace.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external sinks; data flows are confined within parsing functions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or external communication; standard exception handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, focusing on parsing with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n- Risk: 0.2 (low, given it's parsing utility code)\n- Confidence: 0.9 (reasonable)\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring seems consistent. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions; consistent.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks; internal processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or external interactions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard parsing code, safe and clear.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2 (low)\n- Confidence: 0.95 (high)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores align well with the code. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions, including pandas DataFrame type inference.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external sinks; DataFrame serialization/deserialization is standard.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious external communication or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0 (no security risk)\n- Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Parsing functions for whitespace, comments, errors.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external sinks; internal parsing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or external interactions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard parsing utility, safe.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Correctly assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for parsing, no external data sinks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Internal processing only.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious patterns or external system interactions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, safe parsing code.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n- Confidence: 0.95\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as standard parsing utility functions with no malicious intent.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which is justified given the code's nature.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, matching the code's readability.\n- The risk scores are low (0.2 or 0), which is reasonable considering the code is utility-focused and does not handle untrusted external data in a dangerous way.\n- Confidence levels are high, reflecting the clear and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code is purely utility functions with no external side-effects, a risk score of 0 or 0.2 is appropriate. No need to increase.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very minimal, since it's utility code, but slight risk if input data is malicious—though not malicious in itself)\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature. No significant adjustments are necessary.",
