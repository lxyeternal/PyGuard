  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing and processing whitespace, comments, and strings in a WSV (Whitespace-Separated Values) document, including custom exception handling and type inference.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the internal character iterator (_chars) during string parsing, whitespace detection, and comment reading.",
  "sinks": "Data is returned as strings; no external sinks like network or file outputs are present. Potentially unsafe data handling could occur if input is malicious, but no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input characters are read into the iterator; whitespace, comments, or strings are extracted through various methods; exceptions are raised on invalid input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or suspicious external calls. The code primarily processes data within the parsing context. The presence of a custom exception class is normal. No malicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements parsing logic for whitespace and string data in WSV format, including methods to read comments, whitespace, and string values, with error handling via custom exceptions. There are no external system interactions, network calls, or code injection points. The functions operate solely on provided data and internal state, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. No suspicious or hidden code, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are evident. The code appears to be well-structured utility functions for parsing purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of parsing utility functions with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It handles whitespace, comments, and string parsing within a WSV context, with proper error handling. There are no indicators of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious logic.",
