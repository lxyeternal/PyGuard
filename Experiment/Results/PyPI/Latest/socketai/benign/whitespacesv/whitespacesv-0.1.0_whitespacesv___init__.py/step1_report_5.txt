  "purpose": "Main module of the whitespacesv package, likely serving as an entry point or aggregator for the package's functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'whitespacesv.document' and 'whitespacesv.utils', which are internal modules of the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform network or system actions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow observed; the code only imports modules and sets version and export variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing internal modules and setting versioning and export variables. No user input, environment variable access, or external network calls are present. The structure is typical for a main module, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a straightforward main module setup for the package with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
