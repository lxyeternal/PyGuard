{
  "purpose": "The code serves as the main module of the whitespacesv package, initializing the package by importing core components and setting version and export information.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from internal modules 'whitespacesv.document' and 'whitespacesv.utils' during import statements.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The data flow is limited to static imports from internal modules; no untrusted data flows to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal package initializer that imports internal components, sets version info, and defines exports. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. All imported modules are internal, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate it is benign and standard for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization module with no malicious intent or security issues. All signals and reports are consistent in their assessment, and the scores should be set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
