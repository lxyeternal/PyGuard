  "purpose": "Main module initialization for the whitespacesv package, importing core components and setting package metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements from whitespacesv.document and whitespacesv.utils modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input; only static imports and metadata assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup with import statements and metadata definitions. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated constructs, or dangerous operations. It does not perform any data processing, input reading, or network operations. The imports are from local package modules, which appear to be standard for package structure.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a standard package initializer with no malicious or security risk indications. It performs no dangerous operations and contains no anomalies or suspicious behavior.",
