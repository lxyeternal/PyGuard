  "purpose": "Main module initialization for the whitespacesv package, exposing certain classes and functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from the package's own modules: whitespacesv.document and whitespacesv.utils.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code detected. The code is straightforward module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations, imports specific classes and functions from internal modules, sets versioning and export variables. It appears to be standard package setup code without any external data handling, system calls, or dynamic code execution. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package main module initializer with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It does not perform any untrusted operations or contain obfuscated/malicious code.",
