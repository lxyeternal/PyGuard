  "purpose": "Main module initialization for the whitespacesv package, exposing key classes and functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: whitespacesv.document and whitespacesv.utils.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leak points; no external input/output handling.",
  "flows": "Imports and module-level definitions; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from internal modules and defines package metadata. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or contain dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident. The code appears to be a standard module initializer, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module initializer with no malicious or security-threatening behavior detected.",
