  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and sets metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer: it imports specific components and defines version info. There are no input sources, no data processing, or untrusted data handling. It does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or malicious activities. The only notable points are the imports from the package's own modules, which appear standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
