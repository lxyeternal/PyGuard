{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes for handling text documents, converting characters to code points, and iterating over text content.",
  "sources": "File reading in the load method of TxtDocument, text input to the TxtCharIterator constructor",
  "sinks": "File writing in the save method of TxtDocument",
  "flows": "Input text is loaded from files, stored internally, and written back to files; iterator reads characters and provides line info",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual or suspicious code patterns. No network, no system commands, no data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for text conversion and file I/O, with straightforward implementations. The load method reads files with UTF-8 encoding and handles BOMs; save writes text to files with specified encoding. The iterator class processes text characters, tracks position, and provides line info. No external data is transmitted or received, no suspicious code execution, and no dynamic code evaluation or obfuscation detected. The functions and classes follow standard practices without suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for text processing with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It performs file I/O and character processing securely, with no malicious or suspicious operations.",
