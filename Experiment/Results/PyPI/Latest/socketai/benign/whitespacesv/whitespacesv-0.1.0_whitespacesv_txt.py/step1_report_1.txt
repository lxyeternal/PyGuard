  "purpose": "Provides classes and functions for handling text documents and iterating over text characters.",
  "sources": "Reading text from files in the load() method; accessing and manipulating internal text state.",
  "sinks": "Writing text to files in the save() method.",
  "flows": "load() reads from filesystem -> creates TxtDocument instance; save() writes to filesystem -> writes internal text.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code performs standard file I/O and text processing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for string and code point conversions, a TxtDocument class for reading and writing text files, and a TxtCharIterator class for iterating through text. The load() method reads file content with utf-8 encoding and strips BOM if present, which is standard. The save() method writes text to a file with specified line endings and encoding. The iterator class manages character positions and provides line information, with no suspicious or malicious logic. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or sensitive data handling detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward text processing utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs file reading/writing and text iteration securely and conventionally.",
