{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and classes for handling text documents and character iteration, including file I/O with BOM handling and character conversions.",
  "sources": "File reading via Path.read_text(), input text passed to TxtCharIterator, and file_path parameter in save() method.",
  "sinks": "File writing in save() method; no external network or command execution observed.",
  "flows": "load() reads text from file; save() writes text to file; TxtCharIterator uses internal character list for iteration and position tracking.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard text file handling, with proper BOM handling and safe file I/O. Character conversion functions are straightforward. The iterator provides line and position info without side effects. No external dependencies or network activity. The logic is clear, and no malicious or obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for text processing with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The malware score should remain 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score at 0.1 to reflect minimal file I/O risk. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for use.",
