{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility classes and functions for handling text documents and iterating over characters in a text, including file read/write operations and character encoding conversions.",
  "sources": "Reading text from files in the load() method; accessing text via the text property; character iteration via TxtCharIterator.",
  "sinks": "Writing to files in the save() method; converting characters to code points and vice versa.",
  "flows": "File reading (load) reads text from disk -> stores in class instance -> potentially processes characters -> writing text back to disk (save).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors. The code does not contain any network activity, external command execution, or system modifications. The use of Path.read_text and open with controlled parameters is standard. Commented-out constants (NEW_LINE) do not impact functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for converting between strings and code point lists. The TxtDocument class reads and writes text files using standard Python I/O with UTF-8 encoding, handling BOMs. The load() method reads text and ignores BOM if present. The save() method writes text with line endings. The TxtCharIterator class allows iteration over character code points, providing methods to get line info and advance. No untrusted input sources, no data exfiltration, no external network calls, or obfuscated/strange behaviors are present. The code appears to be straightforward text handling utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard text processing utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs file I/O and character iteration in an expected manner, with no suspicious or malicious features detected.",
