  "purpose": "Provides a base class for handling text documents and a character iterator for text processing.",
  "sources": "Reading text files from disk using Path.read_text and load method, accessing text input via constructor.",
  "sinks": "Writing text to files in save() method.",
  "flows": "Text is loaded from disk via load(), stored internally, and then written back to disk via save().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Functions perform straightforward text processing.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages text data: converting strings to code points and vice versa, reading and writing files, and iterating over characters. It correctly handles UTF-8 BOM, and the file I/O uses standard library functions with appropriate encoding. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as network activity, system manipulation, or data exfiltration is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, well-structured text processing classes with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The only potential concern could be file I/O operations, but they are implemented securely using standard Python functions without unsafe practices.",
