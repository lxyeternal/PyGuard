  "purpose": "Unit tests for the WsvLine class, validating its methods and behavior.",
  "sources": "pytest parameterized tests and class instantiations; no input reading from external sources or user input.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is being written to external systems, files, or network.",
  "flows": "Test functions call class methods directly with controlled inputs; no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of unit tests that verify validation functions, equality, and representation methods of WsvLine class. It employs parameterized testing for inputs and checks for expected exceptions and outputs. All inputs are predefined strings or lists, with no external data sources or untrusted input handling. There are no indications of malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious data leakage. The code appears to be straightforward testing code intended for ensuring correctness of class behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of standard unit tests for a Python class, with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious code. The overall security risk is negligible.",
