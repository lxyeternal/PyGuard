  "purpose": "Unit tests for the WsvLine class, which validate its methods and behaviors.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to test functions (whitespaces, comment), imported modules, and class instantiation within tests.",
  "sinks": "Assertions and exception handling within test functions; no data sinks related to untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into validation functions, which either pass or raise exceptions; no external data or network operations occur.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. The tests are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing modules and a class for unit testing the WsvLine class. It performs parameterized tests to validate whitespace and comment validation methods, checks equality, and verifies string representation. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The focus is solely on validating the behavior of the class methods under various inputs.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard unit testing code for validating the behavior of the WsvLine class. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. The code is well-structured and uses typical testing practices.",
