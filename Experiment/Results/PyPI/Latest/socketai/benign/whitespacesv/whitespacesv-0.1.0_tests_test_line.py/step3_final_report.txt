  "purpose": "Unit tests for the WsvLine class, validating whitespace, comment, equality, and representation methods.",
  "sources": "Controlled test inputs within the test functions; no external data sources or untrusted input handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; the code does not process external data or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "N/A – tests operate on predefined data without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard set of pytest unit tests for a data class, checking validation methods, equality, and string representation. It uses controlled inputs, expects specific exceptions for invalid data, and performs no external operations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The tests are well-structured and typical for such classes, with no suspicious logic or data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward implementation, and the scores should reflect this.",
