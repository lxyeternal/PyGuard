  "purpose": "Static analysis utility for Django projects to identify unused URLs, methods, templates, and duplicates.",
  "sources": "Reads project files, configurations, and filesystem directories; modifies sys.path and environment variables for setup.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission or harmful system modifications; internal filesystem and environment setup only.",
  "flows": "Reads project files and configurations; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors; placeholders indicate incomplete implementation but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static analysis tool with incomplete features, primarily performing filesystem scans and environment setup. It does not execute untrusted data, communicate externally, or modify system state maliciously. The placeholders suggest future enhancements but do not imply malicious activity. The code's structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The environment modifications are standard for such tools and do not pose security risks in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis utility for Django projects, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low risk score reflects minor environment setup routines, which are typical in such tools. Overall, it poses minimal security threat.",
