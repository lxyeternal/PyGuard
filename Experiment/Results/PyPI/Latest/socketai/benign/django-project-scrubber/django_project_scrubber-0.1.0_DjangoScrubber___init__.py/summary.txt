  "conclusion": "The code reviews indicate mostly benign code with low malware and obfuscation scores, except for Report 2, which shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution but lacks confirmed malicious payloads. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis, warranting no further adjustments but ongoing vigilance."
