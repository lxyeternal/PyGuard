  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'django-project-scrubber' for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only executes standard setup functions.",
  "flows": "Reads the 'README.md' file content and passes it to the setup() function without sanitization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; all code appears to follow standard packaging practices. The only external resource is the 'README.md' file, which is common and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools to configure the package distribution. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, entry points for CLI, author info, description, and classifiers. The only file read operation is the 'README.md' for long description. No dynamic code execution, no user input handling, and no suspicious external connections or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It properly defines package metadata and dependencies without any indicators of malware or security risks.",
