  "purpose": "Standard package setup configuration for a Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file during setup, package metadata, dependencies, entry point declaration.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external network connections present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward setup script with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script using setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior. Reading 'README.md' is standard practice, and the entry point points to a main function in a module, which is common for CLI tools. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning zero malware and obfuscation scores, and minimal risk scores. Minor concerns about reading files without exception handling are standard and not malicious. The code poses no security threats or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a benign, standard packaging script with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
