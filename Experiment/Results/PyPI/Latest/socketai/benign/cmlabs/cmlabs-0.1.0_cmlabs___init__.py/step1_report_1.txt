{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package named 'cmlabs' that provides access to several computational mathematics submodules.",
  "sources": "Import statement for importlib, list of submodules, and the __getattr__ function for dynamic importing.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import in __getattr__ which loads submodules based on attribute access.",
  "flows": "Access to an attribute triggers __getattr__, which dynamically imports the corresponding submodule.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses __getattr__ for dynamic submodule loading, which can be normal but also potentially misused if malicious modules are present. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a package structure with submodules and uses __getattr__ to load modules on demand. It imports importlib to facilitate dynamic importing, which is a common pattern. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward and appears to be a standard package loader implementation. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical Python package loader with dynamic submodule import. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided snippet. The design appears standard and safe.",
