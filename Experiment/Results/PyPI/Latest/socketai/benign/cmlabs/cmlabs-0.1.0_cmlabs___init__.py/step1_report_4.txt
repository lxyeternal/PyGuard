{
  "purpose": "This code defines the structure of the 'cmlabs' library, a computational mathematics package for Python, with submodules for various mathematical functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports submodules dynamically based on attribute access.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; there are no network, file, or environment variable operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the dynamic import of submodules occurs only when attributes are accessed.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic attribute access (__getattr__) to load submodules lazily, which is not inherently malicious but can be misused if submodules are compromised. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a modular package structure, enabling dynamic import of submodules upon attribute access. It avoids executing external code or data, and there are no signs of malicious behavior. The use of __getattr__ for lazy loading is standard in some package designs and does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The structure is straightforward and typical for large Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package structure setup for the 'cmlabs' mathematics library. It uses standard Python idioms for modular imports without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
