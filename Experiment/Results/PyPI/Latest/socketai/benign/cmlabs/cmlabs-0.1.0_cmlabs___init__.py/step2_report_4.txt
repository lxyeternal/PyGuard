  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard package loader with dynamic submodule import via __getattr__. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning is sound; dynamic import via __getattr__ is common and not inherently malicious.  \n- The risk score is low, which seems appropriate given the benign nature.  \n- Malware score is zero, aligning with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, with emphasis on potential exploitation if attribute names are externally controlled. Still, no malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The analysis correctly notes that __getattr__ could be exploited if attribute names are manipulated, but in normal use, this is standard.  \n- The risk score is very low, which is appropriate.  \n- Malware remains at zero, consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard nature of the code, no external data, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning is straightforward and accurate.  \n- The risk score of zero is appropriate for a benign package initializer.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard package structure with dynamic import; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The analysis is consistent and reasonable.  \n- The risk score of zero aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard modular setup with lazy loading; no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity detected.  \n- The risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard package loader using __getattr__ for dynamic submodule import.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk very low) are consistent with the code's behavior and the analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, benign Python package initializer with dynamic submodule loading. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is evident, and the security risk is negligible. The scores assigned across reports are appropriate and justified.",
