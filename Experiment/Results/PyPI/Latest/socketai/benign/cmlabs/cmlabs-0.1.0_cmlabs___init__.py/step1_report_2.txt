  "purpose": "Define a Python package 'cmlabs' that provides computational mathematics functions and submodules for interpolation, differentiation, integration, and linear algebra.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data. It imports the 'importlib' library for dynamic module loading.",
  "sinks": "The code dynamically loads submodules, which could potentially lead to loading malicious modules if the module name is manipulated externally.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are present within this code. The only flow involves dynamic import based on attribute access, which could be exploited if module names are manipulated.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ to dynamically import submodules based on attribute name could be exploited if attribute names are controlled by an external or malicious source. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a package interface with a list of submodules and uses __getattr__ for lazy loading these submodules via importlib. The approach is standard for modular packages and does not contain obfuscation or malicious patterns. The only potential concern is that dynamic import via __getattr__ might be exploited if attribute names are controlled externally; however, in typical package use, this is standard behavior. No external data inputs, no network activity, and no sensitive information handling are present. Overall, the code appears benign and standard for a Python package interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package interface with dynamic submodule loading. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this code. The use of __getattr__ for dynamic import is a common pattern and does not constitute malicious behavior.",
