{
  "purpose": "The code implements a cubic spline data interpolator supporting 'not-a-knot' boundary conditions, providing methods for interpolation and derivatives based on input data points.",
  "sources": "Reads input data points (xvals, yvals), boundary condition type, and internal data structures for computation.",
  "sinks": "No external system calls, network communication, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through internal calculations to the interpolate and derivative methods; no external sinks or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Raises NotImplementedError for unimplemented boundary conditions with a humorous message; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard scientific implementation of cubic spline interpolation using numpy and an external linear solver. It handles data input, computes slopes for 'not-a-knot' boundary conditions, and provides interpolation and derivatives. No external communication, system modifications, or suspicious patterns are present. The incomplete boundary condition support is explicitly marked and not malicious. The humorous error message is unprofessional but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a transparent, standard numerical utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data leaks. The minor incomplete feature support and unprofessional messaging do not pose security risks.",
