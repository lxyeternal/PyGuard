  "purpose": "Implementation of a cubic spline data interpolator for given data points with support for various boundary conditions.",
  "sources": "Reads input data points from xvals and yvals, accesses boundary condition type, reads from internal class methods and the 'thomas' function.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no code writes to external systems, files, or network, nor handles untrusted inputs insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input data (xvals, yvals) flows into the class constructor; the internal '_not_a_knot' method processes data and calls 'thomas' to compute slopes; 'interpolate' and 'derivative' methods use stored data and slopes to produce outputs based on input x.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Boundary conditions 'clamped' and 'periodic' raise NotImplementedError, which may be intentional placeholder, not malicious. No unusual or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cubic spline interpolation with support for 'not-a-knot' boundary condition. It uses numpy for numerical computations and imports 'thomas' from 'cmlabs.linalg', likely a standard tridiagonal solver. The class methods perform calculations consistent with known algorithms for cubic splines. No code manipulates environment variables, network, or system files. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activities are detected. The logic appears standard and aligned with mathematical formulas for cubic splines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of a cubic spline interpolator with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It handles data securely within numerical bounds and does not perform any external or insecure operations. The only noteworthy aspect is the placeholder for unsupported boundary conditions which raises errors rather than malicious actions.",
