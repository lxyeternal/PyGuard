  "conclusion": "Most reports are correctly scored with low or zero malicious activity due to lack of evidence. Report 5 demonstrates features indicative of malicious or obfuscated code, warranting higher suspicion. Slightly increasing the malware score for report 5 to 0.55 improves alignment with observed indicators. The overall assessment remains cautious but justified, emphasizing the need for manual review of report 5 before deployment."
