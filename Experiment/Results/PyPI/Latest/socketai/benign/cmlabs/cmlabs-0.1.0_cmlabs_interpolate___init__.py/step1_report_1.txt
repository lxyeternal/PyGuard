{
  "purpose": "To provide a collection of interpolation methods and related utilities in the cmlabs.interpolate module, including various interpolation techniques and test functions.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from internal modules (_interpolate, _cubic, and test_interpolate). It does not process external input data directly.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no code executes untrusted data, writes to files, or transmits data over networks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only performs imports and module definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be a straightforward module and test suite setup with no suspicious or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all functions from internal modules _interpolate and _cubic, and all test functions from test_interpolate. It appears to be part of a larger package focused on mathematical interpolation methods. There are no data input points, no dynamic execution, and no obfuscated or suspicious code behavior. The content is typical for a scientific computing package, with no signs of malicious behavior or hidden backdoors. The structure and imports are standard and do not suggest tampering or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for interpolation utilities and their tests. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. There are no indications of malware or security risks within this code fragment.",
