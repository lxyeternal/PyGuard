  "purpose": "The code is part of a documentation module for the cmlabs.interpolate package, providing interpolation methods and utilities with associated tests.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources are present in this snippet; it primarily imports functions and modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling are present; the code only imports modules and functions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely performs imports for a documentation or API module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code strictly consists of import statements and documentation strings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from local modules (_interpolate, _cubic) and a test suite (test_interpolate). It appears to be part of a package's API documentation and testing setup. There is no dynamic code execution, input handling, or data processing that could pose security risks. The structure is straightforward, serving only to expose functionalities and tests. No signs of obfuscated code or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import and documentation setup for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It is safe and aligns with typical package structure.",
