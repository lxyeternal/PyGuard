{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python module for various interpolation methods and utilities, including tests for these methods.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_interpolate, _cubic, test_interpolate)",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data outputs that process untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; mainly imports and documentation strings",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains module documentation and import statements for functions and test modules related to interpolation. It imports functions from internal modules (_interpolate, _cubic) and a test suite. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling is present. The content is standard for a Python package module, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign Python module focused on interpolation methods with accompanying tests. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this code snippet.",
