  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the scores, potential issues, and consistency.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module setup with no dynamic execution, data handling, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code only imports internal functions and test modules, with no external input or output.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Basic module with interpolation methods and tests.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- Justification: No malicious activity, no external data, no obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Fully consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Documentation and module imports.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- Justification: Same reasoning as above; purely static imports and documentation.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Documentation for the package.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- Justification: No dynamic code, no external data, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Defines interpolation methods and tests.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- Justification: No malicious activity; purely import statements and documentation.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Module with interpolation functions and tests.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- Justification: No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scoring:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, justified by the absence of dynamic or external data handling.\n\n### **Any anomalies or issues?**\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation detected.\n- The code is standard for a scientific Python package.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- The code is safe, with no security risks or malware indications.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
