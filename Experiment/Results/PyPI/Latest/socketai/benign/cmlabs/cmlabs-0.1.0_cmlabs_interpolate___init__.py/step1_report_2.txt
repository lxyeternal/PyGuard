{
  "purpose": "This code provides documentation and module imports for an interpolation library, including various interpolation methods and their tests.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from internal modules ('_interpolate', '_cubic') and test modules ('tests.test_interpolate'). It also contains documentation strings describing the module's functionality.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks for untrusted data or output in this code. It solely imports functions and defines documentation.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily establishes module structure and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is standard for a Python module with documentation and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of module documentation and import statements, with no dynamic execution, user input handling, or external data processing. It does not perform any operations that could lead to data leaks, code injection, or malicious activity. The imported modules are internal, and their content is unknown, but based on their names, they are likely standard functions related to interpolation methods. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a benign Python library setup for interpolation functions and their tests. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity is evident in this code.",
