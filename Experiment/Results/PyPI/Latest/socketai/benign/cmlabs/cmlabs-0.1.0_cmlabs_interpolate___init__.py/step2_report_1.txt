  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module setup for an interpolation library, mainly involving import statements, documentation strings, and test functions.\n- No dynamic execution, user input handling, or external data processing is present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- The code appears to be part of a scientific or mathematical package, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment of issues:**\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None of the reports indicate any malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Code flaws or errors:** The code is purely import and documentation, which is standard for such modules. No errors or flaws are identified.\n- **Malware score:** Consistently zero across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscation:** Zero, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Zero, as there are no data flows or operations that could compromise security.\n\n**Scores and their justifications:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — No malware activity is indicated.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — The code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0.0 — No security risks are evident; the code is purely structural and documentation.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n\nGiven the consistent findings across all reports, I agree with their assessments. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — no security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign module setup for an interpolation library, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The reported scores are appropriate, and I see no reason to adjust them.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that the internal modules (`_interpolate`, `_cubic`, and `test_interpolate`) are also free of issues, but based on this snippet and reports, the overall security posture is sound.",
