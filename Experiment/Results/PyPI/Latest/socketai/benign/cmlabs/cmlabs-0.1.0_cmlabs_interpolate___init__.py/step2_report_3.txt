  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications based on the provided code and reasoning.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily composed of import statements and documentation strings.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or data processing.\n- The code imports internal modules (_interpolate, _cubic, test_interpolate) but does not execute any functions or process data.\n- No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign and standard for a scientific computing package.\n\n**Specific points to consider:**\n- The code is a module setup for interpolation functions and tests, with no evidence of malicious payloads.\n- The imported modules (_interpolate, _cubic, test_interpolate) are internal, and their content is unknown, but their names suggest standard functionality.\n- The code does not process external input or perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward import and documentation structure.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- The code is safe, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation detected.\n- The high confidence scores (1) are justified.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final note:** No changes are necessary; the reports correctly identify this code as benign and free of security concerns.",
