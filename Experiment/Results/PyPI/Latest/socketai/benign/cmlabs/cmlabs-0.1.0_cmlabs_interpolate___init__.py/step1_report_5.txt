{
  "purpose": "The code defines a module for various interpolation methods and related utilities, including tests and spline functions.",
  "sources": "Imports all functions from internal modules (_interpolate, _cubic) and test functions from tests.test_interpolate.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; the code mainly imports functions and does not execute any untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Imports may load functions that could potentially handle data, but no data flow from untrusted sources is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious functions, is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements for internal modules and test cases. It provides module documentation and imports relevant functions for interpolation and testing. No functions or executable code are present that handle user input, network operations, or data processing that could be exploited for malicious purposes. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Python module setup for interpolation utilities with accompanying tests. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
