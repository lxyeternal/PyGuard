{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module for interpolation methods and their tests within the cmlabs library, providing functions like lagrange, newton, finite differences, and splines.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_interpolate, _cubic) and test modules (test_interpolate).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external input, output, or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Import statements load functions; no data flows or execution paths involving untrusted data are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup with import statements and documentation strings. It does not perform any dynamic execution, data processing, or network communication. The internal modules and test functions are standard for a scientific package. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module for interpolation functions with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are appropriate.",
