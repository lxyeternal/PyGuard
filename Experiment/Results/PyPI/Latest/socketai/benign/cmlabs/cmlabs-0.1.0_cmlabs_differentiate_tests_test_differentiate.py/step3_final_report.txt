  "purpose": "Mathematical testing script for derivatives via Lagrange interpolation, validating derivative calculations against analytical formulas.",
  "sources": "Input data from numpy arrays (`X`, `Y`) and external function `lagrange_derivative` from `cmlabs.differentiate`.",
  "sinks": "Print statements for output; no external data sinks or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows internally through calculations; no untrusted data sources or external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard numerical derivative validation using polynomial interpolation. It relies on well-known mathematical formulas and external library presumed legitimate. No network, file, or system modification activities are present. The external dependency does not exhibit any malicious behavior within this context. The code is transparent, well-structured, and intended for educational or validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. External dependencies are presumed legitimate. The scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly zero; the security risk is negligible. The code does not pose any supply chain security threat.",
