  "purpose": "A comprehensive test suite for various interpolation and differentiation methods, validating numerical accuracy and error bounds.",
  "sources": "Internal functions, numpy arrays, predefined data, and mathematical functions within the code.",
  "sinks": "No external data exfiltration, network communication, file I/O, or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows within calculations, assertions, and print statements; all internal and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns, no obfuscation, no backdoors or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard validation suite for numerical interpolation methods, with mathematical assertions and print statements. It uses internal data and functions, with no external dependencies or network activity. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is educational and validation-oriented, with no signs of sabotage or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured test suite for numerical algorithms, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and risk = 0.1 are justified given its validation purpose and absence of external or harmful operations.",
