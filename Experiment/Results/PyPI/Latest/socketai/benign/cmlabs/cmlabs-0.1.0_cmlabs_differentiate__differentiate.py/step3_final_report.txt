  "purpose": "Computes the k-th derivative of a Lagrange polynomial at a specified point using data points.",
  "sources": "Input data points (xvals, yvals), x-coordinate, derivative order k",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks or system interactions; purely mathematical calculations",
  "flows": "Input data -> recursive derivative calculations -> output derivative value",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; recursive approach may be inefficient but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code performs a mathematically valid calculation of derivatives of Lagrange polynomials. It uses recursion and combinatorial functions without external system calls or data exfiltration. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The recursive implementation is inefficient but not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's benign nature, though the security risk score could be lowered from 0.2 to 0 given the absence of security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, mathematically focused utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The recursive approach is inefficient but not harmful. The dependency is safe for use.",
