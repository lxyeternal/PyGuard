  "purpose": "This code calculates the k-th derivative of the Lagrange interpolating polynomial at a specified point, given data points.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from parameters xvals, yvals, x, and k. Uses itertools.combinations and numpy for computations.",
  "sinks": "Performs calculations internally; no data leaks or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through mathematical computations involving products and combinations to produce the derivative result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Recursive derivative calculation could be inefficient but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a mathematical function for polynomial derivatives using recursion and combinatorial methods. It only operates on numerical data provided as input, with no external network calls, file I/O, or suspicious behavior. The recursive approach is computationally intensive but does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code or hidden functions detected. The code appears to be a straightforward mathematical implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a mathematical utility for derivative computation, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs complex calculations but remains within benign boundaries.",
