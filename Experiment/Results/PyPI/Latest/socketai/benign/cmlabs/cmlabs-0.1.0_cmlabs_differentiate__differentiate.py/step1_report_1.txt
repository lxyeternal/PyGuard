  "purpose": "Compute the k-th derivative of the Lagrange interpolating polynomial at a given point based on provided data points.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: xvals, yvals, x, k; data from itertools.combinations; data from numpy functions.",
  "sinks": "Mathematical calculations involving derivative computations; potential data flow into return value.",
  "flows": "Input data (xvals, yvals, x, k) are processed through recursive function to produce the derivative value.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. Recursive implementation may be inefficient but not malicious. No unusual network or system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a mathematical function for derivatives of Lagrange polynomials, relying on recursive combinatorial calculations. It only performs numerical computations with numpy and itertools, with no external data transmission, file operations, or system modifications. The logic appears consistent with mathematical principles, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code segments. The code does not interact with the network, system files, or environment variables. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward numerical implementation for calculating polynomial derivatives. It does not contain malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious activities. It appears safe and intended for mathematical or testing purposes.",
