  "purpose": "Compute the k-th derivative of the Lagrange interpolating polynomial at a given point x using provided data points.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from parameters xvals, yvals, and x.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs; purely computational function with no data leaks or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into mathematical calculations without external data influence or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or signs of obfuscation. Uses recursion and combinatorial functions but nothing suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a mathematical computation of derivatives of Lagrange polynomials using recursive functions and combinatorial logic. It relies on numpy and itertools, standard Python libraries, with no external network or system calls. The recursive approach may be inefficient but does not introduce malicious behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, no data exfiltration, and no side effects beyond computation. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a mathematical utility for polynomial derivative calculations with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate scientific computation function.",
