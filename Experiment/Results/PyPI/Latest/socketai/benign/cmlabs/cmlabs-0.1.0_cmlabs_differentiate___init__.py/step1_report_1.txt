  "purpose": "This module provides differentiation functions and their associated tests for mathematical computations.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._differentiate and .tests.test_differentiate",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; purely defines and imports functions and tests",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only internal imports and module documentation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; standard documentation and imports",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains module-level documentation and imports from internal modules. There are no external data inputs, no data processing, nor any code execution based on untrusted data. The imports are from local modules that presumably contain legitimate differentiation logic and tests. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The structure and content are typical for a Python package module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with documentation and imports, showing no malicious intent or security risks.",
