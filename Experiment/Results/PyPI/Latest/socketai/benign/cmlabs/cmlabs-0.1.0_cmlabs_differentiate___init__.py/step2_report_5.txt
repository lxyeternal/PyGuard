  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Content Verification**:\n   - All reports describe a module that primarily contains documentation and static imports from internal modules (`._differentiate` and `.tests.test_differentiate`).\n   - The original code snippet confirms this: it imports everything from `_differentiate` and the test module, and contains only module-level docstrings.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code**:\n   - No code execution, external data handling, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors are evident.\n   - The code appears to be a standard package module, likely an `__init__.py` or similar.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n   - The overall confidence is 1, which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Risks or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is only importing internal modules and documenting the package.\n   - No claims are made about external inputs, network activity, or runtime behaviors that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the provided code and reports, there are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe code is a benign, standard module setup with documentation and imports, with no security concerns.",
