{
  "purpose": "This module provides differentiation methods and related utilities, including Lagrange differentiation and tests.",
  "sources": "Imports all functions from the internal '_differentiate' module and test functions from 'test_differentiate' module.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; the code only imports functions and modules.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted input; the imports are static and do not process runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual code patterns; it only imports existing modules and functions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python module that documents and imports functions for differentiation tasks. It does not handle user input, external data, or perform any operations at runtime. All statements are static imports, with no signs of obfuscated code or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module definition with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply imports differentiation utilities and tests, serving as part of a larger codebase. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
