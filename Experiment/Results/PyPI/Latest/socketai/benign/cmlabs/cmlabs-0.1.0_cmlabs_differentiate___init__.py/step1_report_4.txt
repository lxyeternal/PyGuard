{
  "purpose": "This module provides differentiation methods and related utilities, including tests, for mathematical computation.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._differentiate and .tests.test_differentiate",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data; only internal module imports",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and purely for module organization and imports",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python module that documents its purpose and imports submodules for differentiation and testing. It contains no user input handling, no external data sources, and no suspicious logic. The import statements are from internal, relative modules, which is standard practice for package code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware. The code is clean and standard for a Python package's __init__.py or module file.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module definition and import file for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
