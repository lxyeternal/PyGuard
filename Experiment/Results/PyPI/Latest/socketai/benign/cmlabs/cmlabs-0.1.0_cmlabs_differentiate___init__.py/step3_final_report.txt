{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, providing differentiation functions and their tests, primarily through documentation and import statements.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from internal module files: '._differentiate' and '.tests.test_differentiate'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions from internal modules; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains only documentation strings and import statements, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module setup with documentation and internal imports. It does not handle external input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The import statements are from local modules, typical for package initialization. The documentation describes differentiation functions and tests, which are standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module with no malicious or security concerns. The scores should reflect zero risk, malware, and obfuscation, consistent with the analysis.",
