{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package called 'cmlabs', defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reads the README.md file content into 'long_description' during setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. It reads the README.md file to populate long_description, which is a common practice. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The dependencies are specified with version constraints but no malicious intent can be inferred. Overall, the code is straightforward and follows standard package setup conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears safe and legitimate.",
