  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration script for packaging a Python library named 'cmlabs'.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing packages and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure actions.",
  "flows": "Reading file content into long_description during setup; no untrusted data flows to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read README.md without validation, but this is standard practice in setup scripts; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for Python packaging using setuptools. It imports setup and find_packages, defines package metadata, reads long description from a local README.md file, specifies package dependencies, and configures classifiers. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code constructs present. No untrusted data sources or dangerous sinks are evident. The script adheres to standard packaging conventions and does not include obfuscated or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup configuration script for a Python package. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
