  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'cmlabs' intended to facilitate computational mathematics labs.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file content for long_description",
  "sinks": "No evident sink where untrusted data is used in a security-sensitive manner",
  "flows": "Reads from the filesystem ('README.md') and passes data to setup() parameters",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read a file for long_description; no sanitization or validation, but typical for setup scripts",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script configuring package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery. The open() call reads a markdown file for description; this is common practice. No suspicious code, no dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or network activity. No unusual language features or obfuscation detected. Usage of third-party libraries (setuptools, numpy, scipy) is appropriate for the context and not suspicious. The script performs standard package setup functions without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Python setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It correctly specifies package metadata and dependencies without any indication of supply chain attacks or malicious code.",
