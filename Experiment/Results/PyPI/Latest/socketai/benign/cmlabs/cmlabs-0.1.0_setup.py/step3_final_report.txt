  "purpose": "A standard setup script for packaging a Python library, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description, package metadata, dependencies specified in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external data outputs; reading local files is standard.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' flows into long_description; no other data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open('README.md').read() without exception handling; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script using setuptools. It reads a local README file for description, specifies dependencies, and package info. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of open() without exception handling is typical but minor. All dependencies are common scientific libraries. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The reports are accurate and comprehensive. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
