{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'cmlabs', defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, author's email, long description from README.md, and dependencies from install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is used in a risky manner; no network or system command execution.",
  "flows": "Reads metadata and dependencies from static sources; no dynamic data flow or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open('README.md').read() to load long description, which could raise an exception if file is missing, but this is typical. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python library. It uses setuptools to define package information, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code, no external input processing, no suspicious operations or obfuscated constructs. All code appears conventional and safe for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
