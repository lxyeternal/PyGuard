  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python library named 'cmlabs' with dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no network or data exfiltration code present.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content as long description; no other data flows or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read a local file without exception handling is typical for setup scripts, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads a README file for description but does not incorporate any dynamic or external input at runtime. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The dependencies listed are common scientific libraries. Overall, the script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
