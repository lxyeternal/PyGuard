{
  "purpose": "The code provides a comprehensive implementation of various numerical interpolation methods, including Lagrange, Newton, Stirling, Bessel, Gauss, and related difference table functions, for use in mathematical and scientific computations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as xvals and yvals; no external data sources, files, or network inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "The code performs internal calculations only; it does not send data externally or perform I/O operations that could leak information.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through mathematical functions and difference tables to produce a numerical result; no external data transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and relies solely on standard scientific libraries. The only minor note is the presence of print statements for method selection, which are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard interpolation algorithms with transparent logic, relying on trusted libraries (numpy, scipy, math). There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or external data leaks. The print statements are for informational purposes and do not pose security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured implementation of numerical interpolation methods with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores accurately reflect its benign nature.",
