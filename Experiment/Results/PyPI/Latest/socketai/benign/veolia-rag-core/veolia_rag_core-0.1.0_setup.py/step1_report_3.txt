{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration for 'veolia-rag-core', including reading dependencies, package metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description, reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, and gathers package data from 'rag_core'.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data handling present. No network or file operations involving untrusted sources detected.",
  "flows": "Reads from local files (README.md and requirements.txt) and uses static package data and metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code structures observed. The setup script appears standard and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static configuration: reading local documentation and dependencies, and setting up package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input handling is present. No suspicious or malicious patterns are identified. It follows typical setup conventions without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for package configuration purposes.",
