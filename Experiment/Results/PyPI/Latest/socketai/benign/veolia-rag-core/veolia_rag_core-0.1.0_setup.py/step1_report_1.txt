{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python library called 'veolia-rag-core'. It prepares package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description; reads requirements.txt to list dependencies; defines package configuration and metadata; specifies entry points, package data, and project URLs.",
  "sinks": "None identified that could lead to data leaks, code injection, or malicious actions. No execution of untrusted code or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Reads external files (README.md and requirements.txt) to gather data, then passes this data into setup(). No untrusted data flows to potentially dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code performs standard package setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a library. It reads files for description and dependencies, then configures package metadata and entry points. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or other suspicious behaviors are present. All operations are typical for a setup script and do not indicate malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It simply configures the packaging of a Python library.",
