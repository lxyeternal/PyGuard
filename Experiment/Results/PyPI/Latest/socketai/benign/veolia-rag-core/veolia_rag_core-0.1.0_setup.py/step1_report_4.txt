  "purpose": "This script configures the packaging and distribution setup for the 'veolia-rag-core' Python project, including reading dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long_description, requirements.txt for dependencies, and package data files.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes or transmits data; no dangerous data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Reads external files to gather data, then passes this data to setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code performs standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard practices for Python package configuration: reading files for description and dependencies, defining package metadata, and specifying entry points and package data. All actions are typical for setup.py files and do not involve any dynamic code execution, external data transmission, or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
