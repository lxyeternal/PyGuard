{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package distribution for 'veolia-rag-core', including reading dependencies, metadata, and configuration files.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; Reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies; Reads package data and configuration files during setup.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data processing; no network or system modification code.",
  "flows": "Reads input files -> populates setup parameters -> package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads external files for documentation and dependencies, then calls 'setup()' with the collected data. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or system modifications are present. The code appears to be a standard package setup script, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Python setup script for packaging a module. It does not contain malicious or suspicious code. No security issues or malware are identified based on this code.",
