{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'veolia-rag-core', including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description and 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes or transmits untrusted data; the setup configuration is standard and static.",
  "flows": "Reads files -> Processes data -> Passes data to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed. The code uses standard setup procedures and reads dependencies and descriptions from files.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical Python package setup using setuptools. It reads the README and requirements files securely, then passes this data into the setup() function with standard metadata and configuration options. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or code injection points are present. The usage of open() is straightforward and confined to reading static files. No dynamic execution, network activity, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It is well-structured, uses common practices, and does not include any suspicious behavior.",
