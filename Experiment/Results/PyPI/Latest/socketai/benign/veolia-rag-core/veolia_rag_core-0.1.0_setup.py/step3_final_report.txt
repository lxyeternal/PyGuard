  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a library, reading static files for description and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files from local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and passes their content into setup() parameters; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads local static files and configures package metadata. It does not perform any dynamic operations, network activity, or code execution. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. All signals indicate benign, standard packaging code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify it as safe, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
