{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of integration tests simulating a full document processing and question-answering system using mock components, validating system workflows, error handling, and concurrency in a controlled environment.",
  "sources": "Event emissions within the mock event bus, mock data inputs for document upload, extraction, embedding, retrieval, and question-answering processes.",
  "sinks": "Event bus where data flows through emitted events; no external network or system modifications are involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input events (upload, question) through mock components, resulting in emitted events representing processing stages and final responses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected; code is straightforward and uses standard testing patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code employs mock components to simulate a full system workflow, with event-driven data flow confined within the test environment. No external network calls, secrets, or malicious payloads are present. The tests cover full workflows, error scenarios, and concurrency, all within a controlled, benign context. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation are identified. The data emitted in events is mock data, and no external or sensitive data is involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score assigned in some reports (0.1) is conservative; given the controlled environment, a score of 0 would be appropriate. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
