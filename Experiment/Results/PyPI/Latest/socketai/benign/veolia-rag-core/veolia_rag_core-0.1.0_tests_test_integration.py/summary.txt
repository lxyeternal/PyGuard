  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score assigned in some reports (0.1) is conservative; given the controlled environment, a score of 0 would be appropriate. Overall, the code poses no security threat."
