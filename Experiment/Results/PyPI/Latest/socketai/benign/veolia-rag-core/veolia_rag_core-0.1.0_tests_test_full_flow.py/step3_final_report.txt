{
  "purpose": "This code is a comprehensive test script simulating a full document processing and question-answering workflow using mock components, intended to validate the system's event-driven architecture.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from mock event emissions, mock managers, and predefined test data such as file paths, metadata, questions, and answers.",
  "sinks": "There are no external or untrusted data sinks; data flows within controlled mock components and event bus, with no external network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from event emissions (e.g., document upload) through mock handlers (extraction, embedding, storage, retrieval, generation), with authentication data attached to each event, culminating in assertions on event sequence and data integrity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated logic are present; the code operates within a controlled testing environment with mock components.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes mock managers and event handlers, simulates a full workflow from document upload to answer generation, and verifies event sequences and data correctness. It contains no malicious code, external network calls, or suspicious behaviors. The structure is straightforward, with clear data flow and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It is designed solely for testing purposes within a controlled environment.",
