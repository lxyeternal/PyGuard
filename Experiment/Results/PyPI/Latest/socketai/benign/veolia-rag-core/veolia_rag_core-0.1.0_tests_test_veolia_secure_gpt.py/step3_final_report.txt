{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the VeoliaSecureGPTGenerator class, validating initialization, generation, context management, and error handling using mocks and dummy data.",
  "sources": "Test inputs such as API keys, questions, documents, and context parameters within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data flows; all data remains within test scope, using mock objects and controlled test data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from test inputs (API keys, questions, documents) through method calls within the test functions, without external or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets beyond test placeholders, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, employing mocks and dummy data to test the VeoliaSecureGPTGenerator class. There are no signs of malicious code, external network activity, or obfuscation. The tests cover valid and invalid scenarios, ensuring robustness. The test API keys are placeholders, and no real secrets or external calls are made. The structure and content are typical for unit testing, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe test suite with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified given the controlled testing environment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
