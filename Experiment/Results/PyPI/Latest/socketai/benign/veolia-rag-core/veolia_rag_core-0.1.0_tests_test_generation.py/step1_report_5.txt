  "purpose": "Unit tests for the generation module, testing mock generator and event handler behaviors.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules (pytest, asyncio, datetime, typing), mock classes, and core modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; tests simulate data flows but do not involve actual untrusted input processing.",
  "flows": "Test functions create mock objects, invoke methods, and check responses; no external data or untrusted input flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. Test code is standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test functions verifying mock generator and event handler behaviors. It creates mock data, invokes methods, and performs assertions. No external data processing, no network operations, and no code injection or malicious actions are present. The mock objects are used solely for testing purposes. The tests include input validation, error handling, and event verification, all in a controlled environment. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for a generation system, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not include any backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful logic. Overall security risk is negligible.",
