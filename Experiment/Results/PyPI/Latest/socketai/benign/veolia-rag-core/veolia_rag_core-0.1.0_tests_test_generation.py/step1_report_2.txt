  "purpose": "Unit tests for mock generator and event handler in a document generation system.",
  "sources": "Import statements, mock object initializations, event data inputs, and function calls such as 'await generator.generate' and 'await event_bus.emit'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data leads to harmful actions; the code only calls test assertions and mock functions.",
  "flows": "Input data (test documents and questions) flows through mock generator and event bus functions, with no evidence of untrusted data causing security issues or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code appears to be straightforward test code with typical mocking and assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing for a mock generator and event handler using pytest and asyncio. It initializes mock objects, triggers generation and event emission, and verifies the responses via assertions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or security risks. The code only interacts with in-memory objects and mocks, with no external or untrusted inputs that could lead to malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of unit tests with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and typical for testing purposes.",
