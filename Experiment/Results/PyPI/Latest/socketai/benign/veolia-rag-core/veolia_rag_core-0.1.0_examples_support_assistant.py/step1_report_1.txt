{
  "purpose": "Support support-related queries using RAG core, manage documents, and conversation history for tenants.",
  "sources": "File system access for loading documents, environment variables (via os.path and os.environ if used), and event data received in callbacks.",
  "sinks": "Event bus emissions (DOCUMENT_UPLOADED, QUESTION_RECEIVED), logging outputs, and storage of conversation history in memory.",
  "flows": "Loading files from disk -> emitting DOCUMENT_UPLOADED events; User questions -> emitting QUESTION_RECEIVED events; Callbacks handle stored vectors and answers, updating internal state and logging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data handling; use of sleep for pacing, but nothing inherently malicious or suspicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a support assistant that loads documents from a specified directory, emits events to a core orchestrator, manages conversation histories in memory, and handles events to update logs and internal counters. All data flows seem to be purpose-driven for document processing and Q&A interactions. No suspicious data exfiltration, malicious code execution, or backdoors are present. The use of sleep and standard logging are normal patterns. No obfuscation, malware signatures, or malicious behaviors are detectable.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate support assistant implementation with no signs of malicious intent. It manages documents and conversations securely without suspicious activities or malicious behaviors.",
