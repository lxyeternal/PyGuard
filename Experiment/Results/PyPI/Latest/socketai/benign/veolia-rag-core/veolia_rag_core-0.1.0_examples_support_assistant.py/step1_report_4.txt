{
  "purpose": "SupportSupport assistant that loads support documents, processes user questions, maintains conversation history, and manages multiple tenants using the rag_core framework.",
  "sources": "Reads from filesystem (os.path.exists, os.listdir, open files), receives event data via event bus, accesses environment variables if set elsewhere, and takes user input via method calls.",
  "sinks": "Emits events to the event bus with document info, questions, and responses; logs data including timestamps, question, answer, and sources.",
  "flows": "Filesystem access to load documents -> emits DOCUMENT_UPLOADED events -> receives ANSWER_GENERATED events -> updates conversation history; user questions trigger QUESTION_RECEIVED events.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are observed. Use of sleep for rate limiting is benign here. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads documents from disk, manages event-driven processing via an event bus, and maintains conversation state. It uses standard Python libraries and established patterns for event subscription and logging. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The data flow involves user inputs and event emissions, with sensitive info handled locally in memory. No suspicious or malicious actions are detected. It functions as a support chatbot interface integrating with external core components, with appropriate safeguards and no evidence of sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate support assistant implementation with standard features and no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
