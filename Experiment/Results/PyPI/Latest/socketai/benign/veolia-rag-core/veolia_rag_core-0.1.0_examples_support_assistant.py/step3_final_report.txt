  "purpose": "Support assistant managing document uploads, question handling, and conversation history within a multi-tenant environment.",
  "sources": "Filesystem access for document loading, event bus for message passing, environment variables for configuration, in-memory data structures for conversation history.",
  "sinks": "Event emissions for document upload and question reception, logs for operational info, in-memory storage for conversation context.",
  "flows": "Loading documents from directory -> emitting DOCUMENT_UPLOADED events -> handling questions via QUESTION_RECEIVED events -> generating answers and emitting ANSWER_GENERATED events -> updating conversation history.",
  "anomalies": "Use of time-based session IDs which could be predictable; detailed logging of conversation data that might leak sensitive info; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a support assistant with event-driven architecture, managing documents and conversations without malicious behavior. The use of sleep and timestamp-based IDs are typical but could be improved for security. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The logs do not contain suspicious data, and no network activity indicates malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified based on the code's behavior and potential minor security considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a support framework without malicious or obfuscated elements. Minor security concerns relate to session ID predictability and potential sensitive data in logs, but these do not constitute malware or significant vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
