{
  "purpose": "Unit testing the functionality of the MultiQueryRetriever class and its methods.",
  "sources": "Import statements, test function definitions, mock class usage, and assertions within test functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks found; the code does not write untrusted data to external systems or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "Input data (questions) flow through retrieval functions and generate mock results; no external data flows or untrusted data processing detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. Use of mock classes for testing is typical and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test functions using pytest for unit testing a retriever class. It utilizes mock classes to simulate behavior and asserts expected outcomes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. The code does not perform network operations, file manipulations, or any form of data exfiltration. All code appears standard for testing purposes with appropriate safeguards and no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of unit tests for a retrieval system, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely tests functionality using mock objects and assertions without engaging in any harmful or suspicious activities.",
