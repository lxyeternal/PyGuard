{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the MultiQueryRetriever class, verifying its basic functionality, query variation, result combination, error handling, and usage with custom retrievers.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from test parameters such as questions and mock result lists; it also calls internal methods like _generate_query_variations and _combine_results.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or external data flows; the code operates entirely within the test environment using mocks and assertions.",
  "flows": "Input questions are processed by internal methods, and mock results are combined and evaluated; no external data flows or network interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors are present; the code is straightforward and standard for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of asynchronous unit tests using mocks, with no external data or network activity. It performs standard assertions to verify behavior. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The code is well-structured, with no suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, testing-focused nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard set of unit tests for a retrieval system, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
