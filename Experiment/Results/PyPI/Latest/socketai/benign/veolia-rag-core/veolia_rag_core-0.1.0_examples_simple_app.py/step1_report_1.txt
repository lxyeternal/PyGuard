{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a simple application demonstrating the use of RAG Core for document processing and question answering, including uploading documents, asking questions, and handling events.",
  "sources": "Reads input files from 'examples/docs' directory, user input questions, and configuration environment variables (if any). Uses file system checks and timestamp generation.",
  "sinks": "Emits events via EventBus for document upload and questions, logs data, and handles event responses by logging answers and sources.",
  "flows": "Uploads documents via 'upload_document' method emitting DOCUMENT_UPLOADED events; sends questions via 'ask_question' emitting QUESTION_RECEIVED; event handlers process responses and update counters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code patterns; no obfuscated code; straightforward event handling. No signs of data leakage, malicious network activity, or backdoors; no code injection or unsafe data handling.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a core orchestrator and event bus, subscribing to event types. It processes documents from a directory and sends questions, handling responses via callbacks that log answers and sources. It relies on external 'rag_core' modules, which are assumed to be legitimate. The code performs file existence checks, timestamp-based session IDs, and standard logging. No suspicious code or behavior is evident, and the flow appears to be for demonstration purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example application demonstrating RAG Core usage, with no malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It primarily handles document uploads, question submissions, and logs responses without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
