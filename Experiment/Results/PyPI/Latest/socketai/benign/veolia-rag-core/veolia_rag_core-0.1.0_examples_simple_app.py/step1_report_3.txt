{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates a simple application that uses RAG Core to upload documents and ask questions, with event handling for responses and document processing.",
  "sources": "Reads files from a specified directory; accepts question strings; reads environment variables; uses standard modules like os, time, logging.",
  "sinks": "Emits events for document upload and questions; logs information; potential data flow to event handlers which are not shown but are part of the external 'rag_core' library.",
  "flows": "Uploads documents via event emission; sends questions via event emission; handles events for answers and document storage; logs responses and event counts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. No suspicious or unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution. Uses standard libraries and external dependencies properly.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a core orchestrator and event bus, subscribes to event handlers, and performs file uploads and question submissions. It manages state counters for documents and answers. Event emissions and callbacks appear straightforward without any data manipulation or suspicious behavior. No evidence of malicious actions such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system compromise activities. The external 'rag_core' modules are assumed to be standard or trusted based on their naming and usage. Overall, the code appears to be a benign, purpose-driven sample application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example demonstrating document upload and question-answer interaction via event-driven architecture. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks detected. The code aligns with typical application logic, with no suspicious anomalies.",
