{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple application for document processing and question answering using the RAG Core framework, involving uploading documents and asking questions, with event handling.",
  "sources": "Reads file paths from the filesystem; reads questions from function calls.",
  "sinks": "Emits events such as DOCUMENT_UPLOADED and QUESTION_RECEIVED; logs information.",
  "flows": "File existence and path verification lead to emitting DOCUMENT_UPLOADED; questions are emitted via QUESTION_RECEIVED; event handlers process and log responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of standard event-driven architecture. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a document processing system, uploads documents from a specific directory, and sends questions to an event bus, handling responses via callbacks. It does not perform any network connections beyond event emissions and logging. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The use of timestamps for session IDs and file path handling appears benign. The overall structure is straightforward and aligns with typical event-driven document QA systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign example demonstrating document upload and question-answering workflows using the RAG framework. No malicious intent or suspicious activity is detected.",
