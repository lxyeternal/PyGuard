{
  "purpose": "Sample application demonstrating use of RAG Core for document processing and question answering via event-driven architecture.",
  "sources": "Reads file paths for document upload, question strings for user queries, and accesses environment variables indirectly through os and time modules.",
  "sinks": "Emits events for document upload and questions; logs information. No direct data sinks for untrusted data within the code.",
  "flows": "Uploads documents via event emission, questions via event emission, and handles events to process responses. No untrusted data flows directly to critical sinks like network or system modification.",
  "anomalies": "Uses time-based session IDs which could potentially be predictable, but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a document and question processing system, registers event handlers, and emits events based on user input and file uploads. It performs standard logging, file existence checks, and timestamp generation. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or data exfiltration code present. The event-driven architecture relies on external modules (rag_core) which are assumed to be benign. No signs of backdoors, data leakage, or malicious logic are detected. The code is straightforward, using common programming patterns, with no obfuscated or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a benign sample implementation for a document processing and Q&A system using RAG Core. It does not contain any malware or malicious behavior, nor does it pose security risks based on the provided code. Its design is typical for such applications, with no indicators of sabotage or malicious intent.",
