{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates the use of RAG Core for document processing and question answering within an event-driven architecture.",
  "sources": "File system (os.path.exists, os.listdir), time module (time.time), event bus subscriptions and emissions",
  "sinks": "Event bus emissions (DOCUMENT_UPLOADED, QUESTION_RECEIVED), logging outputs",
  "flows": "File existence check -> upload_document emits DOCUMENT_UPLOADED -> event handlers update counters; ask_question emits QUESTION_RECEIVED -> response handlers log answers",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, readable application that initializes a core orchestrator, handles document uploads and questions, and logs responses. Session IDs are timestamp-based, which is predictable but typical for demos. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. External modules are assumed benign. The event-driven flow is standard, with no data leaks or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of document processing and Q&A functionality. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The security risk score of 0.2 and malware score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
