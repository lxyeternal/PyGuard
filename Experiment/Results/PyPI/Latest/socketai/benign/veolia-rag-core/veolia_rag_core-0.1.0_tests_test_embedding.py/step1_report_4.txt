  "purpose": "Unit tests for embedding mock and event handling components in a Python project.",
  "sources": "Code reads mock data, creates instances, calls async methods, and inspects attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network, file, or system command execution are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from test inputs to mock method calls and assertions; no external or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated elements. Use of mock objects indicates test environment, not production malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test functions that instantiate mock objects, generate data, and verify behaviors via assertions. No external inputs are processed insecurely. No network, file, or system modifications are observed. The code does not contain hidden or suspicious code segments. Use of mock classes and straightforward test logic indicates a focus on testing, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard testing code for mock objects and event handlers. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears to be a benign test suite for development purposes.",
