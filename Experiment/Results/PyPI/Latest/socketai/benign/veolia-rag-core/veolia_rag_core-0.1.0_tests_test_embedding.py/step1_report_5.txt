  "purpose": "Unit tests for MockEmbedding and EmbeddingEventHandler functionalities in an embedding module.",
  "sources": "Input data includes mock documents and event data from the test cases; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; code performs assertions and mock event emissions only.",
  "flows": "Input documents flow through mock embedding generation and event handler processing; no external data flow or network communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. Use of mock classes and standard testing frameworks is typical and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests for embedding and event handling functionalities using mock classes. It verifies correct embedding output, event emission, and error handling. No suspicious or malicious code behavior is identified; code interacts solely within the testing environment and mock objects, with no external system or network interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard unit testing code for embedding functionalities. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code is safe and intended solely for testing purposes.",
