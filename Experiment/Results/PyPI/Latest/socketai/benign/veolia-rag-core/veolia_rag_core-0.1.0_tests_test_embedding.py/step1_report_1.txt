  "purpose": "Unit testing for embedding module, including mock embedding behavior and event handling.",
  "sources": "Input data from test documents and event data; no external data sources used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed within the tests; no flow leading to unsafe actions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No suspicious obfuscation or hidden code present.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard unit tests using pytest and asyncio, employing mocks for embedding and event bus. It verifies embedding generation and event handling behavior. No network operations, file manipulations, or sensitive data handling are present. The code is straightforward, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent or security risks. The overall structure is typical for test suites and does not include any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for embedding functionality with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
