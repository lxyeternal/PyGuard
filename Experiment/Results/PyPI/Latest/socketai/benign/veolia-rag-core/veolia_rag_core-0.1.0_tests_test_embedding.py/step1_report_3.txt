  "purpose": "Unit testing for embedding generation and event handling components, specifically for mock embedding and event bus interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, mock object instantiations, and event handling functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points that process untrusted data leading to vulnerabilities or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Test data flows from mock document/event creation to assertions verifying embedding outputs and event bus behaviors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors; test functions are standard and do not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of structured test cases for mocking embedding processes and event handling within a controlled test environment. It uses standard testing libraries (pytest, asyncio) and mocks to simulate behavior. There are no indications of malicious payloads, external network interactions, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code focuses on validating functionality and error handling of components related to embeddings. No obfuscated code, suspicious dynamic execution, or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a set of unit tests for embedding and event handling modules, with no malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks detected. It appears safe and intended solely for testing purposes.",
