  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is benign and standard. The primary security concern is the implementation of 'main_entry_point', which cannot be assessed here. The code itself does not contain malware or obfuscation. A cautious security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, acknowledging the potential risk if the entry point code is malicious."
