  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry point.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, dependencies, and console_scripts entry point.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'rapidframework.main:main_entry_point' during package installation or invocation.",
  "flows": "Setup script loads and executes the entry point function; actual code execution depends on 'main_entry_point' implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected in the setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py using setuptools, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security concern hinges on the implementation of 'main_entry_point', which is outside this script. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, with the main potential risk associated with the code executed during invocation. Given the absence of evidence of malicious code, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and a conservative security risk score is approximately 0.2 to reflect the potential for malicious behavior in the entry point. The confidence in this assessment is high, as the setup code itself is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is benign and standard. The primary security concern is the implementation of 'main_entry_point', which cannot be assessed here. The code itself does not contain malware or obfuscation. A cautious security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, acknowledging the potential risk if the entry point code is malicious.",
