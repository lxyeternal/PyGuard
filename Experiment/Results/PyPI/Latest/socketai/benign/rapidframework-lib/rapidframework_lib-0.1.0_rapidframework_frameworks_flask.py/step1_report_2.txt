  "purpose": "Defines a FlaskManager class that inherits from Template, initializing with Flask-specific framework name and installing related Flask libraries.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module .template; class constructor and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "super().install_framework call with list of Flask-related libraries.",
  "flows": "Initialization sets framework name; install_framework method calls parent method with library list, passing additional kwargs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns detected. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward class inheritance and method overriding. It initializes a Flask framework manager and provides a method to install specific Flask libraries. No suspicious code, external data input, or potentially malicious behavior is present. The code relies on parent class methods for installation, which are not shown but assumed to be standard. There are no indications of data leakage, malicious payloads, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard class definition for managing Flask dependencies, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
