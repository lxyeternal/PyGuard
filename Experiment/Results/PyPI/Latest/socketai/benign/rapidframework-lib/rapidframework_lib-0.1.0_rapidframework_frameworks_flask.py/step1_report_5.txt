  "purpose": "Define a FlaskManager class that inherits from Template to manage Flask framework dependencies and installation.",
  "sources": "The class constructor and install_framework method, which use input parameters via **kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The install_framework method, which installs specific Flask-related libraries.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from method calls into the super() functions; dependencies are installed via the install_framework method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual dynamic behavior observed. The code primarily manages framework setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from Template, initializing with framework name 'flask', and specifying dependencies to install. No untrusted input processing, no code injection, and no suspicious data handling. The methods rely on superclass behavior and do not perform any external or network operations themselves. The code appears straightforward and intended for dependency management without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard dependency management class for Flask projects with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It simply specifies dependencies for installation.",
