{
  "purpose": "Define a Flask framework manager class that extends a Template class, mainly for installing specific Flask-related libraries.",
  "sources": "The class initialization and the install_framework method, which read class instantiation parameters and method arguments.",
  "sinks": "The install_framework method potentially installs external libraries; however, this is typical for setup scripts and not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "The class constructor initializes with kwargs; install_framework can be called with parameters to install predefined Flask libraries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Template called FlaskManager, which specifies Flask-related setup. The constructor calls the superclass with a framework name. The install_framework method explicitly installs common Flask libraries, passing arguments through. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hidden network connections, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a configuration or utility class for setting up a Flask environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class for managing Flask setup with no malicious intent. It performs standard library installations and does not contain suspicious behavior.",
