  "purpose": "Define a FlaskManager class that extends a Template class for managing Flask-related dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in __init__ and install_framework methods, specifically **kwargs and libs list.",
  "sinks": "super().install_framework call, potentially installing external dependencies listed in libs.",
  "flows": "Input data from kwargs and libs list flows into the parent class's install_framework method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns observed. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from Template, initializing with a framework name 'flask', and providing a method to install common Flask-related libraries. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. The libs list includes common packages and is used in a presumed safe installation method. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The overall code is simple, structured, and typical for dependency management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a manager for installing Flask-related packages. No malicious or suspicious activities are evident.",
