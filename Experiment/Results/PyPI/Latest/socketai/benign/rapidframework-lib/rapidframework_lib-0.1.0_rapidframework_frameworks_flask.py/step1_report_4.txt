  "purpose": "Defines a FlaskManager class that extends a Template class for managing Flask-related frameworks and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The class constructor and the install_framework method, which access class methods and provide a list of dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No external untrusted input or data handling is present; the code primarily defines class methods.",
  "flows": "The code flows from class instantiation to method calls for installing dependencies, with no data from untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The dependency list is standard for Flask projects.",
  "analysis": "The code extends a Template class to manage Flask framework setup. It specifies dependencies related to Flask extensions. No input validation, external data reading, or suspicious behavior is present. The code appears to be straightforward and for project setup purposes. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard class definition for managing Flask dependencies with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
