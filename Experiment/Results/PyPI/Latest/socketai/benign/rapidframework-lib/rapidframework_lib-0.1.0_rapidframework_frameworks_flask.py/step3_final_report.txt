  "purpose": "A utility class for managing Flask dependencies within a larger project, facilitating installation of common Flask libraries.",
  "sources": "The class constructor and install_framework method, which read class initialization parameters and invoke parent class methods to install dependencies.",
  "sinks": "The super().install_framework() call, which likely executes package installation commands; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (kwargs) flow into the constructor; the install_framework method calls the parent method with a predefined list of libraries, leading to dependency installation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class extending a Template, with a constructor setting a framework name and an install method installing Flask-related libraries. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The dependency list is typical, and the code's purpose appears solely to manage dependencies. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and low security risk scores (~0.1). The high confidence levels are justified given the code's simplicity. No discrepancies or logical flaws are present. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection, and uses common libraries. Therefore, the overall assessment is that the code is safe, with minimal inherent risk, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward dependency management class for Flask projects. It contains no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the low security risk. No further action is necessary.",
