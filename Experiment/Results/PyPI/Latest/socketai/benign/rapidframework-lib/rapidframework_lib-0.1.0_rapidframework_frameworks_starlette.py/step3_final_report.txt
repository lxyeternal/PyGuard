{
  "purpose": "Define a subclass 'StarletteManager' extending 'FastapiManager' with default framework name and extra libraries.",
  "sources": "Import of 'FastapiManager' from a relative module; class constructor parameters and default list of libraries.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external calls, or data leaks; attribute assignment and superclass call are safe.",
  "flows": "Class instantiation passing default parameters to superclass; no external data flow or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a backslash for line continuation in the default list, which is syntactically valid but stylistically unconventional; no malicious implications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class extension with default parameters, setting an attribute, and calling the parent constructor. It contains no input validation, external calls, or data manipulation. The import is a relative import typical in package code. The use of a backslash is unnecessary but harmless. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. It is a simple class extension used for configuration purposes in a web framework context. No security risks or malicious behaviors are detected.",
