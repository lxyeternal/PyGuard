{
  "purpose": "Define a subclass 'StarletteManager' that extends 'FastapiManager' with additional libraries and default parameters.",
  "sources": "Import statement for FastapiManager, class constructor parameters, and default list of extra_libs.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data output or external calls with untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "Initialization of 'extra_libs' and calling superclass constructor with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a subclass with a constructor that sets default framework name and a list of extra libraries, then calls the parent constructor. No input handling, external calls, or data manipulation occurs that could be malicious. The import is a relative import, typical in package code. The code appears to be a straightforward class definition meant to extend functionality, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a class extension with default parameters and additional libraries. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
