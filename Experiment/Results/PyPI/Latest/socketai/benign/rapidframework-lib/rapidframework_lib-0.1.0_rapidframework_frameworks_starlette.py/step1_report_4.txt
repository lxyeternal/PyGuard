{
  "purpose": "Define a class 'StarletteManager' that extends 'FastapiManager' for managing framework-specific configurations, including extra libraries.",
  "sources": "The class constructor parameters and the assignment of 'extra_libs'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code primarily sets attributes and calls superclass constructor.",
  "flows": "Initialization flow from instantiating 'StarletteManager' which sets 'extra_libs' and calls 'super().__init__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be standard class extension and initialization without obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class 'FastapiManager' from the current module, then defines 'StarletteManager' extending it. The constructor accepts optional parameters, including 'framework_name' and 'extra_libs', which default to specific strings and a list of libraries relevant for web frameworks. The constructor assigns 'extra_libs' to an instance attribute and calls the superclass constructor with appropriate arguments. No user input handling, external data sources, or suspicious code structures are present. The code seems straightforward, focusing on framework management configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard class extension intended for framework management with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
