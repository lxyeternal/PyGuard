{
  "purpose": "Define a subclass 'StarletteManager' that extends 'FastapiManager' with specific default parameters for framework name and additional libraries.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import statement, class definition, method parameters, and default values within the constructor.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data affects sensitive operations, such as network connections or file writes.",
  "flows": "Input source: class instantiation and parameter defaults -> constructor call -> superclass constructor with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious function calls or unusual patterns. Use of common library names and inheritance appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, defines a subclass that customizes default libraries and passes parameters to the superclass. The default libraries listed are typical for web frameworks and database interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or unusual activity. No user input is processed directly, and no sensitive data handling or network communication is visible in this snippet. The code appears to be a straightforward extension of a framework manager.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple subclass definition with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It appears to be a standard, benign component of a web framework setup.",
