  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simply importing local modules related to web frameworks, configuration, and UV management.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or network communication are involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns are noted.\n- The code appears to be a standard module initialization or setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the description; it only imports classes and sets a version string. No issues are present in the code itself.\n- **Malicious behavior:** There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity in this code snippet.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** Since the code only imports local modules and assigns a version, there are no vulnerabilities to identify here.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Data flow / external interactions:** None present.\n\n---\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0 (correct)\n  - `obfuscated`: 0 (correct)\n  - `securityRisk`: mostly 0, with one report at 0.1 (which is minimal and possibly overestimating risk)\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code, I agree with the majority of the assessments.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The `malware` score is correctly 0; no malicious code is present.\n- The `obfuscated` score is correctly 0; the code is straightforward.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are mostly 0, which is appropriate; the only report at 0.1 is slightly overestimating given the code's simplicity, but it's acceptable if considering potential future risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores for this code:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard import module with no suspicious or malicious activity. The scores should reflect the benign nature, with zero for malware and obfuscation, and a very low risk score (preferably 0) since there's no evident security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the code's benign nature. No modifications are necessary; the current scoring is appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Set security risk score to 0, reflecting no identified issues.",
