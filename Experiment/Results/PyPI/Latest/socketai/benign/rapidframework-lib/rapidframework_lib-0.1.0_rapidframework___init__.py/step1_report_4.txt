{
  "purpose": "The code imports various classes from local modules for framework management and configuration, and sets a version string.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.frameworks', '.config', and '.uv' modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leakage or system effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is evident; the code only performs static imports and defines a version.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. No dynamic execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules and a version string assignment. There is no evidence of reading external input, executing untrusted code, or performing network operations. The imported classes might contain malicious code, but this fragment itself does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious activity. The structure is typical for a module defining its components and version.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward module import and version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard setup code for a Python package.",
