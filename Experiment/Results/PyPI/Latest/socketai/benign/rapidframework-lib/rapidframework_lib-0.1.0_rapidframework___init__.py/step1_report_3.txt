{
  "purpose": "The code imports various classes from local modules, likely for managing web frameworks and configurations.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .frameworks, .config, and .uv",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only imports classes and defines a version string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements and a version declaration",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements for local modules and a version variable. It does not process user input, read from external sources, or perform any data manipulation. The imports appear to be for organizing framework management classes and configuration settings. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The structure is standard for a package's __init__.py or similar setup. No suspicious or malicious code is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as an import interface for other modules. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
