  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package that imports various framework managers and configuration components for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .frameworks (FlaskManager, DjangoManager, FastapiManager), .config (Config), and .uv (UvManager).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leakage or external effects within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows are present; the code only imports modules and sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or unusual code behaviors. The version string is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code solely performs imports of framework manager classes and a configuration object, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. The import statements are standard, and the version assignment is benign. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious code indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical initialization module for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks detected based on this snippet.",
