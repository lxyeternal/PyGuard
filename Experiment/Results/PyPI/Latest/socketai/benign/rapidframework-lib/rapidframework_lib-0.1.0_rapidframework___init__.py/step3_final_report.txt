{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, importing various framework managers and configuration components, and setting a version string.",
  "sources": "Local module imports from .frameworks, .config, and .uv, and the version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; imports are static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a version string assignment, typical for a package's __init__.py. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing occurs. All imported modules are local, and the code does not interact with external sources or perform any security-sensitive operations. The code is clean, simple, and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard module setup code with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward initialization script.",
