{
  "purpose": "The code imports various framework managers and configuration modules, likely for use in a larger application, and sets a version identifier.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .frameworks, .config, .uv",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs are observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is limited to importing modules and defining a version.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code solely performs import statements from local modules and sets a version string. There are no dynamic code executions, network communications, or data processing. The import statements are standard practice in modular Python projects. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module import and version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
