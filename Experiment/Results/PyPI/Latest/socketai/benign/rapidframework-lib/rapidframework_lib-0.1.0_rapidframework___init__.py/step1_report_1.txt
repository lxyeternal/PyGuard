  "purpose": "Import management and configuration setup for a Python web framework application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .frameworks, .config, and .uv",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external communication are present",
  "flows": "N/A - The code only imports modules and sets a version string without data flow or external interactions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules and a version assignment. It imports classes related to web frameworks (Flask, Django, FastAPI) and configuration/UV management. There are no input sources, data processing, or network operations. The structure is typical for a module setup and does not include any dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or embedded secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initialization script for a web framework project, with no malicious intent or security issues identified. It does not contain any malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
