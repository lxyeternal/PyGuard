  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a class inheriting from `Template`, managing dependencies for a FastAPI setup.\n- No external input, user data, or network operations are present.\n- The code is straightforward, with dependency lists extended internally.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The only potential concern is the extension of `extra_libs`, but since it's initialized with a default list and extended internally, the risk appears minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, straightforward class extension.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Verdict:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, confirms benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more detailed but still finds no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Slightly cautious, notes the dependency management but finds no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Verdict:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 might be slightly overcautious, but given the dependency extension, it's acceptable. No actual malicious activity.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Focuses on the potential risk of extending dependencies with untrusted input, but notes that in this code, `extra_libs` is internally controlled.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Verdict:** Slightly higher securityRisk score, but still reasonable given the dependency extension. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All correctly assign 0; code is clear.\n- **Security risk:** Scores are low, mostly 0 or 0.1-0.2, reflecting minimal concern. Given the code's simplicity, these are reasonable.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The slightly higher securityRisk scores in some reports reflect cautiousness about dependency management but are justified given the potential for dependency injection if external input were involved.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.1 (very low, mostly due to dependency management considerations)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, straightforward, and manages dependencies without any malicious intent. The scores across reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Conclusion:** No changes needed. The assessments are accurate.",
