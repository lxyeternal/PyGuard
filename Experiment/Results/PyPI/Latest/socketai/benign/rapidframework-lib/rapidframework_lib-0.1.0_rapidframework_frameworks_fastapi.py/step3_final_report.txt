  "purpose": "Manage dependencies for a FastAPI project, extending library lists internally.",
  "sources": "Internal initialization of 'extra_libs' and extension within 'install_framework'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external input; dependency installation commands.",
  "flows": "Initialization of 'extra_libs' -> extension in 'install_framework' -> dependency installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data influence.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from 'Template' that manages dependencies for a FastAPI setup. It initializes a list of libraries and extends it internally before installation. There are no external inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The dependency list is controlled and static, minimizing risk. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The dependency extension is internal, and no untrusted data influences the process.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward dependency management with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1), reflecting minimal concern.",
