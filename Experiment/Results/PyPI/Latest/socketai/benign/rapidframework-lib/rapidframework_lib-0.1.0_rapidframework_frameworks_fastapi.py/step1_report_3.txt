{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for managing the setup and installation of a FastAPI-based framework, extending a Template class, with specified libraries for web development.",
  "sources": "The code reads class initialization parameters, default library lists, and method arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code potentially uses untrusted input in library installation via self.extra_libs extension, but it appears controlled; no direct data leaks or malicious effects are evident.",
  "flows": "The class initializes with default libraries, extends the list with additional libs during installation, and calls parent methods to set up and install the framework.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. Usage of standard libraries and inheritance pattern is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from a Template class, mainly managing dependencies for a FastAPI project. The libraries are predefined and extended in a controlled manner, with no user input affecting critical operations. There is no dynamic execution, data leakage, or suspicious network activity. The code appears to be standard class setup for a framework with dependency management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, manages dependencies, and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate setup class with no malicious intent.",
