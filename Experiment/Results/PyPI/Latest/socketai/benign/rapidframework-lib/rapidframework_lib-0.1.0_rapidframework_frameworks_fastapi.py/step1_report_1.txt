{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class FastapiManager that manages setup and installation of frameworks and libraries related to FastAPI.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no output or external calls based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily class initialization and method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward class inheritance and method extension.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Template class, then defines FastapiManager inheriting from it. The constructor initializes with default framework and extra libraries, extending the list during install_framework. No user input handling, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no network connections or file manipulations observed. The methods primarily extend functionality and manage dependencies without suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard class definition for managing framework setup with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages dependencies and setup routines for a FastAPI project.",
