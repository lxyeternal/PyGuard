{
  "purpose": "This code imports modules and classes from relative packages, likely for managing web frameworks and templates, and includes an import of example functions or data.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .django, .flask, .fastapi, .template, and .examples.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs to untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; all imports are static and local.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious imports are present. The code is straightforward and only involves importing components.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static imports of classes and functions from local modules. No user input, environment variables, or network activity is involved. The import of * from .examples could include potentially risky code, but as it is a typical import statement, it does not indicate malicious intent by itself. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard import block that does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger codebase setting up dependencies for web framework management and templates.",
