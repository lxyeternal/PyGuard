  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the conclusions and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code only contains import statements from local modules and a wildcard import from `.examples`. No data processing, network activity, or external interactions are present.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no data flow or sink vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct. The code is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, only import statements from internal modules and examples.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior or anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, only import statements, with no executable code or external interactions.\n- **Findings:** No malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Import statements, including a broad `from .examples import *`.\n- **Potential concern:** Using `import *` can obscure what is imported, potentially hiding malicious code or unintended functions. While not inherently malicious, it can be considered a security concern.\n- **Findings:** No direct malicious activity, but the use of `import *` warrants some caution.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — this seems reasonable given the potential for namespace pollution.\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly notes the broad import as a mild concern but finds no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 is justified; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, only static imports.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior or anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — perhaps slightly cautious, but acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Zero, no signs of obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code snippets and the analyses.\n- Given the nature of the code (import statements only), higher malware or risk scores are unwarranted.\n- The only point of slight concern is the use of `import *`, which can be flagged as a minor security or maintainability issue, but not malicious.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 for reports 4 and 5 due to broad import, 0 for others.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- No significant changes needed.\n- The code appears benign and does not pose security risks based on the provided snippets.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always review the actual contents of `.examples` and other modules to ensure no malicious code is hidden there, but based solely on these import snippets, the assessment is sound.",
