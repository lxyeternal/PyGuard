{
  "purpose": "This code imports various modules and classes, likely for managing different web frameworks and templates, and includes examples.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the same package (relative imports), potentially from user-defined or library code.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling or external network connections present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; purely import statements with no execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports is common but not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing classes from sibling modules and all contents from an 'examples' module. There is no executable code, data processing, or external communication. No signs of malicious activity or security risks are apparent. The imports suggest modular design for web framework managers and templates, which is typical in web development projects.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, performing straightforward module imports without any malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger, well-structured project. No suspicious behavior detected.",
