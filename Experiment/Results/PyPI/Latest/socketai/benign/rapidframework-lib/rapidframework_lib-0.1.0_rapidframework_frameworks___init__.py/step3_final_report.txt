  "purpose": "Import statements for local modules and classes, setting up dependencies for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Relative imports from local modules: .django, .flask, .fastapi, .template, and wildcard import from .examples.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process data or perform external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely static import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .examples import *' can cause namespace pollution, which may obscure imported entities but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. The use of relative imports and wildcard import from .examples is standard but can be risky for namespace pollution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior are present. The minimal security risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports is justified due to the broad import, but overall, the code is benign. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The assessments across reports are consistent and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The minor security concern related to 'import *' is acknowledged but does not constitute a security threat. The scores and evaluations are accurate and require no adjustments.",
