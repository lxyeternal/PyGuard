{
  "purpose": "Import statements for various framework managers and templates, likely part of a larger Python package for web framework integrations.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .django, .flask, .fastapi, .template, and all contents from .examples.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; import statements generally do not act as data sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; imports do not constitute data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual to see broad import of all (*) from .examples, which can obscure what is imported but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, referencing local modules. There are no functions, data processing, or code execution that could be malicious. The use of relative imports indicates this is part of a larger package structure. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or dynamic code execution is present. The broad import from .examples could be used to hide or include unintended code, but without further context, this remains speculative.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of import statements for a Python package module, with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. The use of import *, while potentially problematic for namespace pollution, does not indicate malicious intent by itself.",
