{
  "purpose": "This code imports various modules and classes related to web frameworks and templates, likely for managing or interfacing with Django, Flask, FastAPI, and templating functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .django, .flask, .fastapi, .template, and all contents from .examples.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or external data is sent. No network, file, or environment interactions are visible.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable within this snippet. The imports suggest modular code organization but no data processing flow is present here.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. Import statements are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules and a wildcard import from an examples module. There are no functions, data processing, or external calls present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious activity are detected. Since this is purely import code, it does not by itself pose any security risk or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement block setting up dependencies or components from local modules. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious anomalies, or security concerns evident within this fragment.",
