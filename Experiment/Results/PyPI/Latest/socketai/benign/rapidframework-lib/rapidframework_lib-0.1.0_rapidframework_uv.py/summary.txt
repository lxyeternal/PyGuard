  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment management utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is input validation for 'libs' in 'install_libs' to prevent injection risks. Overall, the code appears safe for use, assuming external inputs are controlled or sanitized."
