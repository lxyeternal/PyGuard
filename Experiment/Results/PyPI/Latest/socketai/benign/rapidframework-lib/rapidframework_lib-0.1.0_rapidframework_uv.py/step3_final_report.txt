  "purpose": "Manage virtual environment setup and dependencies via external CLI tools 'pip' and 'uv'.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration data from cfg.source_dir and cfg.source_files; executing subprocess commands for 'pip' and 'uv' operations; using 'libs' parameter in install_libs method.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing 'pip', 'uv init', 'uv sync', 'uv add' commands; potential for command injection if 'libs' list is manipulated externally.",
  "flows": "Source: 'libs' list in install_libs method; Sink: subprocess run commands executing 'uv add <lib>' for each lib.",
  "anomalies": "No input validation on 'libs' before passing to subprocess; straightforward subprocess calls; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages environment setup through subprocess calls to external tools, with configuration data read from a Config object. The 'install_libs' method executes 'uv add' commands with user-supplied 'libs' list without validation, which could be exploited if manipulated externally. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess calls are standard and include exception handling for missing modules. The main security concern is the potential for injection if 'libs' is untrusted. Malware detection scores are zero, consistent with no malicious payloads. Obfuscation scores are zero, as the code is clear. The security risk score is set at 0.2, reflecting the potential for injection via unvalidated inputs, but no active exploitation is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment management utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is input validation for 'libs' in 'install_libs' to prevent injection risks. Overall, the code appears safe for use, assuming external inputs are controlled or sanitized.",
