{
  "purpose": "The script computes subject identification rates based on various SPD metrics for neuroimaging data, utilizing different distance functions and processing subject matrices.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (--base-path, --tasks, --scan-types, --resolutions, --metric, --alpha, --z, --tau, --num-subjects), user input through arguments, and external file loading via load_matrix and find_subject_paths functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit untrusted data; it mainly reads input data and performs calculations internally. No network connections or sensitive data leaks are detected within this script.",
  "flows": "Input arguments → Path discovery via find_subject_paths → Loading matrices with load_matrix → Distance calculations using specified metric functions → Computation of identification rates → Logging of results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code performs standard data processing, and all functions are imported from presumably legitimate modules. No obfuscated language features or unnecessary dynamic code execution are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes command-line argument parsing, loads neuroimaging matrices, computes distances with various metrics, and calculates identification rates, then logs the results. All operations seem to be standard for scientific data processing. No network communications, system modifications, or sensitive data handling are evident. Importantly, no hardcoded secrets, unusual behaviors, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard scientific data processing script for neuroimaging analysis, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It safely performs computations based on provided inputs and modules. The overall security risk is very low.",
