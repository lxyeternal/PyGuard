{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to compute identification rates (ID rates) for different SPD metrics on neuroimaging data, comparing matrices across various tasks and scan directions.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from file paths returned by find_subject_paths, specifically matrix files loaded via load_matrix.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed internally and used in distance calculations, with no apparent direct sinks for untrusted data outside the computation; logging outputs results but does not handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input paths -> load_matrix -> compute distance functions -> compute_id_rate -> log output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The distance calculations use parameters passed from command-line args but do not appear to be malicious. The code appears standard for neuroimaging data analysis.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts parameters via command line, loads matrices from specified paths, computes various distances based on selected SPD metrics, and calculates identification rates. It uses standard libraries and functions without obfuscation or suspicious logic. No external network access or hidden data exfiltration is present. It processes data and outputs logs without storing or transmitting data elsewhere. The structure and function calls are typical for scientific data analysis code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate neuroimaging data analysis tool with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs standard data loading, computation, and logging without any suspicious behavior or malicious payloads.",
