{
  "purpose": "This script computes identification rates for different SPD metrics on neuroimaging data across multiple tasks and scan types.",
  "sources": "Input parameters from command line arguments; external functions such as find_subject_paths, load_matrix, and compute_id_rate; loaded matrices from specified file paths.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data processing that could lead to data leakage or code execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Command line arguments → parameter parsing → data loading (find_subject_paths, load_matrix) → distance computations → id rate calculations → logging outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected; the code uses external modules presumed to be standard.",
  "analysis": "The code parses command line arguments to specify data paths, metrics, and parameters. It loads matrices based on user input, computes distances using predefined functions, and calculates identification rates. The flow is straightforward and relies on external, presumably safe, modules. No signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads, are present. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate data analysis tool for neuroimaging metrics. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious code patterns. Its purpose is analytical, not harmful.",
