{
  "purpose": "The script computes identification rates (ID rates) for SPD metrics applied to neuroimaging data, specifically comparing matrices derived from different scan directions and tasks.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments (--base-path, --tasks, --scan-types, --resolutions, etc.), and data files loaded via find_subject_paths and load_matrix functions.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed internally; no direct sinks are evident. The script does not write or transmit data externally within this code segment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from command-line input and file loading functions into distance computations; computed distance matrices are then used to calculate ID rates. No external network or file modifications are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard libraries, structured argument parsing, and clean control flow. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes argument parsing with clear options, loads matrices from specified paths, computes multiple SPD metrics based on user-selected parameters, and calculates ID rates. All operations appear standard for a neuroimaging analysis pipeline. Functions imported are from relative modules and are invoked with parameters from user input; no malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or privilege escalation is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical scientific analysis script designed for processing neuroimaging data. It does not contain malicious or suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling behaviors. It performs legitimate computations related to SPD metrics and ID rate calculations, with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
