  "purpose": "The code computes identification rates (ID rates) for various SPD metrics on neuroimaging data, loading matrices from disk, computing distances, and logging results.",
  "sources": "Filesystem-based matrix files loaded via find_subject_paths and load_matrix functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission or network activity; outputs are logged locally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file loading (load_matrix) through distance computations to ID rate calculations and logging.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard scientific data processing: parsing arguments, loading matrices, computing distances using established functions, and calculating ID rates. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The security risk stems solely from filesystem access, which is typical in data analysis scripts. The malware score is zero, and the obfuscation score is zero, with a minimal security risk score (~0.1) justified by data handling but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate neuroimaging analysis script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are consistent with the analysis: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
