  "purpose": "Unit tests for the function compute_id_rate from spd_metrics_id.id_rate module.",
  "sources": "np.array inputs for compute_id_rate, test inputs defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling evident; test assertions compare function output.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into compute_id_rate; output is checked via assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and pytest to perform unit testing on the compute_id_rate function. The tests verify that the function returns a value close to 1.0 for a specific input matrix and checks that the return type is a float. The code appears to be straightforward test code without any signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. No suspicious code execution, external network connections, or obfuscated segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test script for a Python function with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
