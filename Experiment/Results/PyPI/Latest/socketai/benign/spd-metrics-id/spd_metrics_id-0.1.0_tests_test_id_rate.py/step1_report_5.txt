  "purpose": "Unit tests for the function compute_id_rate from the spd_metrics_id.id_rate module.",
  "sources": "np.array inputs for test cases, specifically the matrices D.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output manipulations observed; assertions check output types and values.",
  "flows": "Input arrays are used as parameters to compute_id_rate; no data flows into external systems or sensitive data leaks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of standard testing functions and numpy appears typical.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two test functions using pytest for the compute_id_rate function. Inputs are numpy arrays, with one test expecting a float output and the other verifying the type. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The code solely performs typical unit test procedures with standard libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate unit tests for a computation function. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks.",
