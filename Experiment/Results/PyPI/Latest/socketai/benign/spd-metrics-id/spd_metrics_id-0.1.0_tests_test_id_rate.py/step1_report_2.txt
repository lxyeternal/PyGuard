  "purpose": "Unit testing for the function compute_id_rate from the spd_metrics_id.id_rate module.",
  "sources": "np.array inputs within test functions.",
  "sinks": "compute_id_rate function processing data, likely within the imported module.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the numpy arrays into compute_id_rate for calculation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; standard testing code with no hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and pytest, then defines two test functions to verify compute_id_rate's correctness and type behavior. The test inputs are simple numpy arrays, and assertions check for expected output values and types. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be straightforward test code for a statistical metric function. No external network calls, data leakage, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test suite for a mathematical function, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities, and the code structure is clear and conventional.",
