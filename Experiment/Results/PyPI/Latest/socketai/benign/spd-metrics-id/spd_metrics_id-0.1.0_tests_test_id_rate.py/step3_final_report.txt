  "purpose": "Unit tests for the function compute_id_rate to verify correctness with specific numpy array inputs.",
  "sources": "Static numpy arrays within test functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Input arrays are passed directly to compute_id_rate; no external data flow or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard test suite using pytest and numpy to validate compute_id_rate. It involves static inputs and assertions without side effects or external data. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate, though the risk could be lowered to 0 given the benign nature. Overall, the code is safe, clean, and typical for testing numerical functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate; minor adjustments could set the risk score to 0, but current assessments are reasonable.",
