{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to load a matrix from a text file and generate file paths for neuroimaging data based on specified parameters.",
  "sources": "os.listdir() for listing directories, os.path.isdir() for checking directories, input parameters (path, task, scan, resolutions, n)",
  "sinks": "os.path.join() for constructing file paths, np.loadtxt() for loading matrices from files",
  "flows": "Input parameters → directory listing and filtering → path construction → data loading (np.loadtxt)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious or unusual code behaviors; the code performs standard directory and string operations without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward approach to generate file paths based on directory contents and parameters. It loads matrices using numpy's loadtxt. There are no indications of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The functions handle standard file operations and path constructions without suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to neuroimaging data management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing directory listing, string manipulation, and data loading tasks typical of data processing scripts. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
