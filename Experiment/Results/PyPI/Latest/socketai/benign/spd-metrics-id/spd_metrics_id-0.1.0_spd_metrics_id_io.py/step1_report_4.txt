{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to load a matrix from a text file and generate file paths for fMRI data based on subject directories, task types, scans, and resolutions.",
  "sources": "os.listdir() for directory listing, os.path.isdir() to filter directories, user-provided arguments for paths and parameters.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is written or sent over network, nor are there system modifications or external calls that indicate malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (base_dir, task, scan, resolutions, n) influence directory listing and filename generation, but no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations that could be exploited.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, and no obfuscated code. Usage of standard library functions appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code loads matrices using numpy, which is standard for numerical data. The path generation function constructs file paths based on directory contents and parameters, following predictable patterns. The logic handles common conditions like different tasks and resolutions correctly, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. No external network calls, file manipulations beyond path creation, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for handling neuroimaging data files with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as intended, using safe and standard practices.",
