{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for loading a matrix from a text file and generating file paths for subject-specific neuroimaging data files based on various parameters.",
  "sources": "os.listdir() and os.path.isdir() to read directory contents and check directories; os.path.join() to construct file paths; np.loadtxt() to load data from a file.",
  "sinks": "np.loadtxt() reads from a file path provided by load_matrix(); the generated file paths are used to load data, but no direct sink for untrusted input or data leakage exists within this code.",
  "flows": "Directory listing and filtering -> path construction based on parameters -> file path generation for data loading.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious hardcoded URLs or commands, no unusual or misleading code patterns, and no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads directory listings to identify subject folders, sorts and optionally limits the number of subjects, and constructs file paths based on task and scan parameters. It uses standard library functions and numpy to load data, with no indication of malicious behavior. The filename construction logic appears routine and consistent with neuroimaging data management. There are no network operations, no data exfiltration, and no code that could execute arbitrary or malicious commands. The code does not contain any backdoors, hidden behavior, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs benign file handling and path generation for data processing in neuroimaging workflows. There is no evidence of malicious intent or harmful activity.",
