{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load a matrix from a text file and generate file paths for fMRI data based on input parameters such as subject directories, task labels, scan directions, and resolutions.",
  "sources": "os.listdir and os.path.isdir for directory listing and filtering; function parameters for input data such as 'path', 'base_dir', 'task', 'scan', 'resolutions', and 'n'.",
  "sinks": "os.path.join used to construct file paths, which are then returned; no data is written or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence directory scanning and filename generation; the generated paths are based on directory contents and input arguments. No untrusted data flows into insecure system calls or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs standard filesystem operations and string manipulations. There are no obfuscated elements, malicious logic, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard library functions to list directories and construct filenames based on input parameters. It filters subject directories and generates paths according to specified task labels, scan directions, and resolutions. The logic appears straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. No malicious or sabotage activity is evident, nor are there signs of data exfiltration or backdoors. The code is typical for data preprocessing in neuroimaging pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears benign and intended for data path generation and matrix loading in a neuroimaging context. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks present in this code segment.",
