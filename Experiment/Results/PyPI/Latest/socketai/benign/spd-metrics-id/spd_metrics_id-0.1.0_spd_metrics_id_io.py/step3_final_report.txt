  "purpose": "Generate file paths for neuroimaging data based on directory contents and parameters, and load matrices from text files.",
  "sources": "os.listdir, os.path.isdir, os.path.join, input parameters (base_dir, task, scan, resolutions)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows into vulnerable sinks, no data exfiltration or network activity",
  "flows": "Listing directories -> filtering subject folders -> constructing filenames based on task and scan -> generating full paths -> loading matrices with np.loadtxt",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard filesystem operations: listing directories, filtering for subject folders, constructing filenames based on task labels and scan directions, and loading matrices from text files. It uses straightforward string formatting and standard library functions without dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. No signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection are present. The logic is typical for neuroimaging data pipelines, and the code is clear and maintainable. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to filesystem access, which is common in such workflows. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat. All reports correctly identify the lack of malicious activity, obfuscation, and significant security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low (~0.1). The overall confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
