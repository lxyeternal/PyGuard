{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to load a matrix from a text file and to generate file paths for neuroimaging data based on subject directories, tasks, scans, and resolutions.",
  "sources": "os.listdir() for directory listing, os.path.isdir() to filter directories, os.path.join() to construct file paths, function parameters for input data",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or transmits untrusted data or interacts with external systems in a suspicious way",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed to generate file paths based on directory contents and task/resolution parameters; no untrusted data is manipulated in a way that leads to leaks or malicious effects",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no unusual code patterns, obfuscated logic, or hardcoded secrets; no suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The load_matrix function simply loads data from a specified file using numpy; it does not contain suspicious or malicious code. The find_subject_paths function lists directories, filters them, and constructs file paths based on input parameters and task names. It differentiates between 'REST' tasks and others to generate filenames accordingly. The logic appears standard for data handling scripts without any suspicious or malicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The code operates solely on local filesystem paths and user inputs, with no external communication or malicious actions evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility for managing neuroimaging data files, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not contain backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code. The functions are standard and safe.",
