  "purpose": "Module initialization with version string and imports of internal functions for data analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.io, .distance, .id_rate).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no sinks that could leak data or execute malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Import statements load functions; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no dynamic execution or data processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and imports multiple functions from internal modules related to matrix operations, distance calculations, and ID rate computation. There is no external data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is simple, clear, and typical for a package setup. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minimal security risk score (0 or 0.1) assigned in reports aligns with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
