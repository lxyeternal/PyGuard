{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting version information and importing functions from local modules related to data processing and analysis, likely for a scientific or analytical project.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data directly; it imports functions from internal modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks is present; imports are static, and no runtime data handling is shown.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. All imports are from local modules, typical for structured codebases.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and imports multiple functions from local modules: 'io', 'distance', and 'id_rate'. These functions are presumably used for data loading and various distance computations. There are no signs of external data input, data leaks, or malicious operations. The code structure is typical for a modular Python package.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code functions as a straightforward import statement block in a Python package, with no suspicious activity detected.",
