{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set the version and import specific functions from internal modules for use in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.io, .distance, .id_rate) that load functions related to matrix loading, distance computations, and ID rate calculations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data, no network operations, no file writes, and no execution of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions that may process data but does not show data flows; any potential flow depends on how imported functions are used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward, standard Python import syntax, and contains no hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a version string and imports multiple functions from internal modules. All imports are from relative internal modules and appear to be related to data processing, distance computations, and ID rate calculations. No external data sources, network activity, or executable code is present. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or suspicious activity within this fragment. It appears to be a typical setup for a package or module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an initialization or import setup for a larger package. There are no signs of malware, security risks, or obfuscated code. The overall security risk is minimal.",
