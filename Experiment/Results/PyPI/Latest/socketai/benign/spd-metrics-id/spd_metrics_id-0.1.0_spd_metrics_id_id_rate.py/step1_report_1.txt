  "purpose": "Calculate the identification rate by comparing the minimum distance indices for each item in a distance matrix.",
  "sources": "Reads the distance_matrix parameter, specifically its shape and contents, and the np.argmin function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leaks or untrusted data processing outside the scope of the function.",
  "flows": "Uses the distance_matrix to identify the minimum values per row and compare with row indices to compute accuracy.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code features detected. The code appears to be a straightforward utility function.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy, defines a function to compute an identification rate based on a distance matrix, and performs a comparison of minimum distance indices to row indices. It operates solely on the provided input data without any external data sources or sinks. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior is present. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to data analysis or pattern recognition.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a basic calculation of identification accuracy from a distance matrix. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and benign.",
