  "purpose": "Calculate the identification rate based on a distance matrix by determining how often the minimum distance corresponds to the correct index.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'distance_matrix' used in numpy operations",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no output or data exfiltration mechanisms present",
  "flows": "Input 'distance_matrix' flows into the numpy operations for index comparison",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy for numerical operations, defines a function that computes the ID rate by summing correct identifications where the minimum value in each row matches the row index, then divides by total number of rows. The logic is straightforward and uses common numpy functions. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present. The code performs a typical evaluation of a distance matrix for identification accuracy without external data leaks or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple and legitimate calculation of identification accuracy based on a distance matrix. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no hidden data flows, and no obfuscated code. It appears safe and intended for standard analytical purposes.",
