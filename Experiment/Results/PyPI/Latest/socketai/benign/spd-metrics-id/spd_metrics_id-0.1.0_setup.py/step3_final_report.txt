  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static code with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, minimal setup script importing 'setuptools' and invoking setup() with default parameters. It contains no dynamic behavior, no data input/output, and no suspicious constructs. The simplicity and standard nature of the code indicate no malicious intent or security risk. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
