  "purpose": "The code provides functions for computing various distances and divergences between symmetric positive definite matrices, primarily for mathematical and statistical analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads matrix data from function inputs, specifically matrices A, B, X, and Y, through function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or places where untrusted data is directed outside of calculations; no network, file, or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input matrices through mathematical operations such as matrix power, square root, and logarithm functions, with no untrusted data being sent or used in potentially harmful ways.",
  "anomalies": "The code strictly performs mathematical computations without any unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs various matrix distance and divergence calculations including Bures–Wasserstein, Procrustes, Riemannian, Log-Euclidean, Pearson, and Euclidean distances. All operations involve standard linear algebra functions and mathematical libraries. The functions include appropriate input validation, regularization, and use well-known mathematical procedures. No network, file operations, or system commands are present. There is no indication of malicious intent, hidden behavior, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate mathematical utility for matrix analysis with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It relies solely on established scientific computations without external or unsafe operations.",
