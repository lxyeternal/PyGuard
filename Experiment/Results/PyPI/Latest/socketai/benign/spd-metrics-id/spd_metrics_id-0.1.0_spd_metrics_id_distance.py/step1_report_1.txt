{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for computing various distances and divergences between matrices, primarily for mathematical and statistical analysis, such as Bures–Wasserstein, Procrustes, Riemannian, and Euclidean distances.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input matrices A, B, X, Y provided as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "The functions output numerical results; there are no data sinks that transfer untrusted data elsewhere, nor any network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input matrices through mathematical transformations, such as matrix powers, multiplications, and logarithms, returning distance/divergence values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code strictly performs mathematical computations with proper input validation (e.g., alpha and z bounds). No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes well-known linear algebra operations and distance metrics for matrices, with proper regularization and input validation. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior is present. It relies on standard numpy, scipy, and mathematical functions. No external network or system modifications are involved. The functions seem intended for analysis in a research or data processing context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and focused on matrix computations for statistical distances. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected. The functions use standard libraries and include appropriate validation, indicating a non-malicious, purpose-driven implementation.",
