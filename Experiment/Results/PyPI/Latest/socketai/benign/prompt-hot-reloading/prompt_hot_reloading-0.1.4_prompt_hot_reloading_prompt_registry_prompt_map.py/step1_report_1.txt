{
  "purpose": "The code implements a thread-safe map-like data structure called PromptMap, which manages prompts with concurrent read and write access using read-write locks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from method arguments (e.g., keys and items in __setitem__, __getitem__, update, pop) and internal class attributes (self.prompts, self._lock).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effects could occur if untrusted data is stored or returned, such as in __getitem__, copy, or __repr__, but these are standard behaviors for a data structure and do not process untrusted data beyond storage and retrieval.",
  "flows": "Input data (keys, items) flow into storage via methods like __setitem__, update, and pop; data is read via __getitem__, __repr__, __len__, and others. Data is retrieved and possibly returned in __repr__, copy, and other access methods. Locking ensures thread safety but does not alter data flow paths significantly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. Usage of read-write locks is standard for thread-safe data structures. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a thread-safe map with methods for standard dictionary operations, protected by read-write locks for concurrency control. No external data sources, network connections, or sensitive operations are performed. All data flows are within standard data structure operations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard thread-safe dictionary implementation with no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It solely manages data in a concurrent environment without performing any suspicious actions or external communications.",
