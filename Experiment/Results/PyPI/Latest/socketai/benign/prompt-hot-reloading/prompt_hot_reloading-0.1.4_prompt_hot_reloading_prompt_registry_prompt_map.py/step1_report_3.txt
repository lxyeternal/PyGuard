  "purpose": "A thread-safe wrapper around a dictionary to manage prompts with read-write locking.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reads are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data transmission points are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code manages internal data structures only.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, primarily wrapping dictionary operations with locks. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for thread-safe dictionary operations using read-write locks. It employs context managers for locking mechanisms, ensuring concurrent safety during read and write operations. No external input handling, data transmission, or malicious behaviors are observed. The code structure is standard for thread safety wrappers, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, thread-safe dictionary management utility without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include external data handling, suspicious code, or potential attack vectors.",
