  "purpose": "A thread-safe dictionary wrapper implementing concurrency control via read-write locks to manage access to an internal prompts dictionary.",
  "sources": "Method arguments (__setitem__, __delitem__, update, pop), internal attribute self.prompts, method calls (__len__, __repr__, __unicode__, keys, values, items, has_key, __contains__, __iter__).",
  "sinks": "Return statements exposing self.prompts data, method calls returning references or iterators, which could be accessed externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external method calls into internal self.prompts, with locks ensuring safe concurrent access; data is retrieved or modified via standard dictionary operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward, with proper use of locking mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a thread-safe dictionary using the readerwriterlock library. All methods correctly acquire read or write locks, preventing race conditions. There are no external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The data flow is confined within typical dictionary operations, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The code's simplicity and proper locking indicate a benign, utility class for concurrent data management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented thread-safe dictionary wrapper with no malicious or suspicious elements. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 assigned in some reports is appropriate, reflecting the potential for external misuse but no actual malicious behavior. Overall, the code poses no security threat and is suitable for use in concurrent Python applications.",
