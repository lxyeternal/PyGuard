  "purpose": "A thread-safe class for managing a dictionary of prompts with read-write locking.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from method arguments, class attributes, and built-in functions like repr, len, and dict methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include methods that modify the prompts dictionary (e.g., __setitem__, __delitem__, update, pop) and those returning data (e.g., copy, keys, values, items).",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input (method arguments) into the prompts dictionary, with controlled access via locks. No external untrusted data appears to flow into sensitive sinks in an unsafe manner.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. Use of thread lock is standard. No code injection or malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a thread-safe wrapper around a dictionary, using rwlock.RWLockFair for concurrency control. All data access and modification methods are properly locked, preventing race conditions. The methods are standard for dictionary-like behavior and do not process or expose untrusted input in a malicious way. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, secure implementation of a thread-safe dictionary wrapper for prompts management. No malicious behavior or security risks identified. It does not contain obfuscation or malware. Overall security risk is negligible.",
