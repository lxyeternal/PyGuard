  "purpose": "Load prompt files from a specified directory and monitor for changes to trigger updates.",
  "sources": "Reading files from 'prompt_dir' via os.listdir and open(), filesystem event src_path in watchdog handler.",
  "sinks": "The open() calls and the on_change callback, which could process untrusted data or trigger external actions.",
  "flows": "load_all() reads files into memory; watch() triggers on_change with filename and file content upon modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without context managers; direct use of ev.src_path without validation; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly loads prompt files and sets up a filesystem watcher. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Minor resource management concern due to lack of 'with' statements, but this does not constitute a security risk. The use of ev.src_path is safe within trusted filesystem events. All reports correctly assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2). The overall assessment indicates the code is benign, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation for loading and monitoring prompt files. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
