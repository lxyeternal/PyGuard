{
  "purpose": "The code implements a prompt source that loads prompts from files in a specified directory and watches for filesystem changes to update the prompts dynamically.",
  "sources": "Reads from files in the directory specified by 'prompt_dir' using os.listdir, open(), and os.path functions; also reads files when they are modified or created in the watch method.",
  "sinks": "Calls open() on filesystem events' src_path, which could be manipulated if event data is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Filesystem events trigger on_modified or on_created callbacks, which then read the file content using open() and pass it to the on_change callback.",
  "anomalies": "The code opens files directly based on filesystem events without validation; no explicit validation or sanitization of file paths is performed. No user input or network interaction present. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code loads files from a specified directory and updates its data store accordingly. It uses watchdog to monitor filesystem changes. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or network communication. The only potential concern is trusting the event src_path directly, but as it is a filesystem event, the source is within the filesystem and not directly from untrusted external input. Overall, the code appears to be a standard implementation for dynamic prompt loading with filesystem watching. No malware or malicious logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of prompt management with filesystem monitoring. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It functions as intended for prompt loading and updating, with no security risks identified.",
