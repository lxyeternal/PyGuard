{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for loading prompt files from a directory and watching for changes to reload them dynamically.",
  "sources": "Reading directory contents with os.listdir, reading file contents with open().read(), and file system events via watchdog (ev.src_path).",
  "sinks": "Opening files with open().read() potentially exposes file contents; invoking on_change callback with file data; no direct data exfiltration shown.",
  "flows": "Directory listing leads to reading each file's content, and file modification events trigger reading and callback invocation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without context managers (no explicit resource cleanup), but otherwise standard; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code present. No network activity or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads files from a specified directory and monitors for modifications or creations, triggering a callback with the filename and file content. It relies on the watchdog library for filesystem monitoring. The reading of files and invocation of callbacks appear to be straightforward operations. No network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code does not include any obfuscation or hidden logic. The absence of resource cleanup for open files is a minor concern but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for loading and monitoring prompt files, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any network activity or data leaks.",
