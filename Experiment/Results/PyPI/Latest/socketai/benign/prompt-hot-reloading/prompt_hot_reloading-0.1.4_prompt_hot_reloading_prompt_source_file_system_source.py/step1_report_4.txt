{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class to load prompt data from files in a directory and watch for changes to automatically reload prompts.",
  "sources": "Reads files from the specified prompt directory using os.listdir and open() calls on each file; reads file contents when a file is modified or created.",
  "sinks": "Open file reads are the main sink; no direct writing or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Files are listed and read in load_all; in watch(), file modifications or creations trigger reading file contents via on_change callback.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code are evident. Uses watchdog for monitoring filesystem changes; no suspicious or obfuscated code. No external network or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads prompt data from files in a specified directory, which appears legitimate for a prompt-loading mechanism. It monitors the directory for changes and updates prompts accordingly. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors are detected. The only operations involve reading files from disk, which are expected for this use case.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for loading and monitoring prompt files from a directory, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as expected for a prompt source loader and watcher.",
