{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for loading and monitoring prompt files from a specified directory, allowing dynamic updates when files are modified or created.",
  "sources": "os.listdir, os.path.join, open() calls reading files from self.prompt_dir, and watchdog event handler accessing ev.src_path",
  "sinks": "open() calls to read file contents, potentially used in on_change callback",
  "flows": "load_all method reads files from prompt_dir; watch method monitors file modifications/creations and triggers on_change with file content",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious strings; no obfuscated code; straightforward file operations; use of watchdog for directory monitoring is standard but should be reviewed in context",
  "analysis": "The code loads prompt data from files in a specified directory and sets up a watcher to trigger a callback on file modifications or creation. It uses standard Python libraries os and watchdog without any suspicious or malicious logic. There are no data leaks, network operations, or hidden behaviors. The code relies on external on_change callback, which could be a concern if misused, but within this snippet, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of directory-based prompt loading with live update monitoring. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risks within this code fragment.",
