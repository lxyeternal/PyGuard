  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Reads prompt files from a specified directory.\n- Loads all files into memory via `load_all()`.\n- Sets up a filesystem watcher using `watchdog` to trigger `on_change` callback on file creation/modification.\n- Uses standard Python libraries (`os`, `watchdog`) with straightforward file operations.\n- No network activity, no data exfiltration, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **Functionality:** The code correctly reads files and watches for changes.\n- **Security concerns:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Potential minor issues:**\n  - Files are opened without context managers (`with`), which could lead to resource leaks if many files are processed rapidly. However, this is not malicious.\n  - The `ev.src_path` is used directly without validation, but since it's a filesystem event, it originates from the filesystem itself, not external input.\n\n**Overall, no actual issues or vulnerabilities are present.**\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of each report:\n\n| Report | Purpose & Summary | Key Points | Errors/Flaws | Malware Score | Risk Score | Comments |\n|---------|---------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------|\n| 1 | Standard prompt loader with filesystem watch | No malicious activity, straightforward | None identified | 0 | 0.2 | Reasonable; low risk, no malware |\n| 2 | Similar purpose, emphasizes standard use | No suspicious logic | None | 0 | 0.2 | Reasonable; low risk, no malware |\n| 3 | Same core functionality | No malicious behavior | None | 0 | 0.2 | Reasonable; low risk |\n| 4 | Focus on prompt loading & watching | No signs of malicious intent | None | 0 | 0.1 | Reasonable; very low risk |\n| 5 | Same as above, emphasizes straightforwardness | No malicious activity | None | 0 | 0.2 | Reasonable |\n\n**All reports consistently find no malicious or obfuscated code, and assign malware scores of 0.**\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- **Malware scores:** Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above 0 in some reports (0.1-0.2) to reflect minimal potential issues like resource leaks or direct file access, but these are not security risks per se.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, due to minor resource management concerns, but not security issues)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**Based on the detailed review, I recommend the following scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — very low; mainly resource management concerns, not security risks.\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe and well within expected bounds for a filesystem-based prompt loader.**",
