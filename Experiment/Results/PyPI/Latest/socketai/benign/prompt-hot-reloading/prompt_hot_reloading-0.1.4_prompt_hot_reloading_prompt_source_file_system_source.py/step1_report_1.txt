  "purpose": "This code provides a source for prompts by reading files from a directory and watching for file changes to reload prompts dynamically.",
  "sources": "The code reads files from the directory specified by 'prompt_dir' using os.listdir and open calls.",
  "sinks": "The open() calls read file content into memory; no untrusted data is sent elsewhere or used in insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Files are listed and opened to load prompts; the watch handler triggers on file modifications or creation to reload content via on_change callback.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; the code dynamically reads files and sets up file system watchers in a standard manner without obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os for directory listing and file operations, and uses watchdog for monitoring filesystem changes. The load_all method reads all files in a directory, mapping filenames to their contents. The watch method sets up a filesystem event handler that invokes a callback upon file creation or modification, re-reading the file. No external network operations, no data exfiltration, no malicious code patterns are present. The code appears straightforward, focusing on prompt loading from filesystem events.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for loading and monitoring prompt files. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It operates solely within the filesystem context and does not handle untrusted network input or secret data.",
