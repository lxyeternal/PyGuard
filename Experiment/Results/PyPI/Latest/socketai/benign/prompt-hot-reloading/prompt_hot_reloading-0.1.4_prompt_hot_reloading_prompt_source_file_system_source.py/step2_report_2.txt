  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code reads prompt files from a directory, watches for changes, and triggers a callback. No malicious activity, secrets, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The securityRisk score of 0.2 seems slightly high given the absence of any risky operations, but since the code executes file reads and triggers callbacks, some minimal risk could be justified (e.g., if the callback is malicious). However, the report states no malicious intent.\n- Malware score is correctly 0.\n- Obfuscated is correctly 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard prompt loader with filesystem monitoring, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=1.0.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Same reasoning as above; no malicious activity.\n- The confidence is perfect (1.0), which aligns with the straightforward code.\n- The securityRisk score of 0.2 might be slightly high but acceptable considering the potential misuse of the on_change callback if misconfigured.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, loading prompts with filesystem watcher, no malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The only minor concern is the direct use of `ev.src_path` in open() without validation, but as this is a filesystem event, the source is within the filesystem and not externally untrusted.\n- The malware score remains 0, as no malicious behavior is present.\n- Security risk is low, given the context.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard prompt loader with monitoring.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Slightly lower securityRisk score (0.1) is justified given no suspicious activity.\n- Malware=0, obfuscated=0, appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same core functionality, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The minor concern about not closing files explicitly with context managers is noted but does not imply malicious intent.\n- The scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusions:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward filesystem prompt loader with no malicious activity.\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated scores are correctly 0.\n- The securityRisk scores are generally low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal concern, which is reasonable given the code's operations.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (low, but acknowledging potential misuse if callback is malicious)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, and their scoring aligns with the code's analysis. No significant security issues or malicious activity are present.",
