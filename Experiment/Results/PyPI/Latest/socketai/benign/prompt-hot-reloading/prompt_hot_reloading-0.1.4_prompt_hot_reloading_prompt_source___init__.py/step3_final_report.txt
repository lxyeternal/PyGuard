{
  "purpose": "To evaluate supply chain security risks of the open source Python dependency based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources identified; code snippets are minimal or absent, with some environment variable reads and data processing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data exfiltration points observed; no network connections or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input functions to output functions, with no suspicious or malicious paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "Some code features such as dynamic execution, misleading variable names, and incomplete or obfuscated code, but no concrete malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are either empty or contain benign data handling routines. Reports consistently note the absence of malicious payloads, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious network activity. Slight obfuscation hints are present but not definitive. Malware scores are zero across all reports, and security risks are low (~0.2), reflecting cautious suspicion due to obfuscation or code ambiguity. Confidence levels vary from 0.6 to 0.8, aligning with the clarity of the code and analysis. Overall, the evidence suggests a low likelihood of malicious intent, with no significant security threats detected.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no concrete signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. Obfuscation features are minimal and not indicative of malicious activity. The supply chain security risk remains low, and the code is considered safe based on current evidence.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.2,
