{
  "purpose": "The code defines a PromptRegistry class that manages prompts by loading and updating them from an external PromptSource.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the PromptSource object via the load_all() method and the watch() method, which are external dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not write data to external systems or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The prompt_source.load_all() provides initial prompt data; prompt_source.watch() sets up a callback (_update_prompt) to update internal prompts based on external changes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. The code appears straightforward, relying on external PromptSource for data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from other modules, defines a class PromptRegistry that inherits from PromptMap, and initializes prompt data from an external source. It sets up a watcher callback to update prompts dynamically. The logic appears standard for a registry pattern, with no suspicious data handling, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for managing prompts, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly interfaces with external prompt sources and updates internal data accordingly.",
