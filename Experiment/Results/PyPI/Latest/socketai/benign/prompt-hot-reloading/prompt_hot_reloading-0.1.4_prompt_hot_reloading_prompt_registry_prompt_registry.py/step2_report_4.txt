  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code defines a class `PromptRegistry` extending `PromptMap`.\n- It initializes by loading all prompts from an external `PromptSource` via `load_all()`.\n- It sets up a watcher with `watch()` that triggers `_update_prompt()` to update the internal prompts dictionary.\n- No data is transmitted externally, no secrets or obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is straightforward, and the logic aligns with typical prompt management patterns.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- **External dependencies:** `PromptMap` and `PromptSource` are external; their security depends on their implementation, but the code itself is benign.\n- **Data handling:** No sensitive data leakage or insecure operations are visible.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Suspicious patterns:** None observed.\n\n---\n\n### Score Analysis:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no code injection, no data exfiltration, and no suspicious behavior.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign 0, which is consistent.\n- **Justification:** No obfuscation or code concealment.\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- All reports assign a low risk (~0.1), which seems reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The code's functionality is standard, and external dependencies are presumed safe. The minimal risk accounts for reliance on external modules.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of the Reports:\n- The reports are consistent, emphasizing the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n- They correctly identify that the code is a standard prompt management class with no malicious intent.\n- No claims are based on assumptions; all observations are factual.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** The assigned scores seem reasonable and justified.\n- **Potential adjustments:** No changes needed; the scores align with the code's analysis.\n- **Further scrutiny:** To confirm overall security, review the external classes (`PromptMap`, `PromptSource`) for security, but within this code snippet, no issues are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to external dependencies, but not a concern here)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, straightforward, and secure within the context provided. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard prompt registry with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores reflect this accurately. No changes are necessary.",
