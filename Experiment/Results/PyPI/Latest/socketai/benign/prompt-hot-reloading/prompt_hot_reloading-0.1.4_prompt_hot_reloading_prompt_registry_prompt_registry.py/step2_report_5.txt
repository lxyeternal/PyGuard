  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, comparing their assessments with the actual code, and evaluate the scores and potential risks.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code defines a `PromptRegistry` class extending `PromptMap`.\n- It initializes by loading all prompts from an external `PromptSource`.\n- It sets up a watcher callback `_update_prompt` to handle real-time prompt updates.\n- The code relies on external classes (`PromptMap`, `PromptSource`) assumed to be secure.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- No data leaks, external sinks, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  No. The code appears straightforward and benign.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No logical flaws or mistakes are evident. The code is a typical pattern for managing dynamic data.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and very low `securityRisk` scores (mostly 0.1 or 0). This aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of the Reports:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign `malware: 0`. This is appropriate, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign `obfuscated: 0`. Correct, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  Most reports give `securityRisk: 0.1`, which is very low, reflecting minimal concern. Given the code's simplicity and reliance on external modules presumed secure, this seems reasonable.\n\n- **Flow and Data Handling:**  \n  The data flows are simple: load all prompts, set a watcher, update prompts on change. No external data leaks or suspicious sinks are present.\n\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**  \n  The reports assume external classes are secure. If those classes have vulnerabilities, it could impact overall security, but based solely on this code, no issues are visible.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores Adjustment:**  \n  The scores are reasonable; no significant adjustments needed.\n\n- **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**  \n  None of the scores exceed 0.5, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware and Obfuscation:**  \n  Correctly assigned as 0.\n\n- **Security Risk:**  \n  Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior, a `securityRisk` of 0.1 or 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and does not contain malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned across reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No evidence suggests any security concern warranting higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but 0.1 is acceptable given external dependencies)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated content, and the current scores reflect that accurately.",
