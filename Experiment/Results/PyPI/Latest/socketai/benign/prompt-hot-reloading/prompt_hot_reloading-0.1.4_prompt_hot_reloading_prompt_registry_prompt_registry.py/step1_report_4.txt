{
  "purpose": "The code defines a PromptRegistry class that manages a collection of prompts loaded from a PromptSource, with live updates.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the prompt_source object via load_all() and watch() methods, and from parameters passed to _update_prompt.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present; the code does not process untrusted data in a way that could cause security issues like code execution or data leaks.",
  "flows": "PromptSource.load_all() supplies prompts during initialization; prompt_source.watch() registers _update_prompt to update prompts upon changes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The code uses standard class inheritance and method calls without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from other modules, defines a subclass PromptRegistry with an initialization that loads prompts from prompt_source, and sets up a watcher for updates. The method _update_prompt updates internal prompts dictionary based on inputs. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or backdoors. The code appears to be a straightforward management class for prompts, relying on external modules for actual data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a prompt management class with no malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external modules for data loading and watching, which are presumed to be safe. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed.",
