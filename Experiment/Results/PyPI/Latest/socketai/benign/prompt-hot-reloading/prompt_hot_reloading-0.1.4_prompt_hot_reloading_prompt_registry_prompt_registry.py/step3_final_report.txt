  "purpose": "Manage prompts loaded from an external source, allowing real-time updates via a watcher callback.",
  "sources": "PromptSource.load_all() for initial prompts; PromptSource.watch() for updates.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data transmission or output sinks are present.",
  "flows": "load_all() populates prompts; watch() triggers _update_prompt() to update internal prompts dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward prompt management with no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a PromptRegistry class extending PromptMap, initializing prompts from PromptSource and setting up a watcher for dynamic updates. It performs standard operations without any signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. External dependencies are assumed secure. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious code are evident. The code's logic is clear, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign prompt management class with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
