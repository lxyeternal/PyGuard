{
  "purpose": "Defines a class PromptRegistry that extends PromptMap to manage and update prompts loaded from a PromptSource.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the PromptSource object via load_all() and watch() methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or security issues are present.",
  "flows": "PromptSource.load_all() provides data to initialize self.prompts; watch() sets up a callback to update prompts via _update_prompt() when triggered.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes PromptMap and PromptSource, then defines PromptRegistry, which initializes prompts from the prompt_source and sets a watcher for updates. The load_all() method loads prompts into a dictionary, and watch() registers a callback to update prompts dynamically. No external inputs, network operations, or sensitive data handling are observed. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward extension of prompt management, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply loads and updates prompts from a provided source without any suspicious activity.",
