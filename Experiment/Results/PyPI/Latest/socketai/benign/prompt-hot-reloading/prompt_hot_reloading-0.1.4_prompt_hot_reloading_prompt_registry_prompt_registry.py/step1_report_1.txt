{
  "purpose": "Define a PromptRegistry class that extends PromptMap, managing prompts loaded from a PromptSource with live updates.",
  "sources": "PromptSource.load_all(), PromptSource.watch()",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leakage points are present.",
  "flows": "PromptSource.load_all() feeds data into self.prompts; self.prompt_source.watch() sets up callback for prompt updates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code appears straightforward, managing prompt data.",
  "analysis": "The class initializes by loading prompts from a given PromptSource instance and sets up a watcher for prompt updates. The code relies on external classes PromptMap and PromptSource, assuming they handle data securely. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code simply manages prompt data with an update callback, which is typical for such functionality. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present. Overall, the code appears benign and serves a standard purpose within prompt management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward extension for prompt management, with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It uses external classes for core functionality and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
