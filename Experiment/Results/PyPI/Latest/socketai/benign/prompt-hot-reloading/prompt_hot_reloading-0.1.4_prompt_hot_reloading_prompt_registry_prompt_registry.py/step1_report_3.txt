  "purpose": "Define a PromptRegistry class that extends PromptMap to manage prompts loaded from a PromptSource, with real-time updates.",
  "sources": "prompt_source.load_all(), prompt_source.watch()",
  "sinks": "self.prompts dictionary update in _update_prompt",
  "flows": "PromptSource.load_all() -> prompts dictionary; watch callback -> _update_prompt method updating prompts",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or obfuscated elements observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes, defines PromptRegistry extending PromptMap, and initializes with a PromptSource instance. It loads all prompts and sets up a watch callback for updates. The _update_prompt method updates prompts in a dictionary. No data is transmitted externally, no secrets are embedded, and no suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The design appears to be straightforward prompt management with real-time updates, with no evident malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and intended for managing prompts with real-time updates. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard implementation for prompt management with event-driven updates.",
