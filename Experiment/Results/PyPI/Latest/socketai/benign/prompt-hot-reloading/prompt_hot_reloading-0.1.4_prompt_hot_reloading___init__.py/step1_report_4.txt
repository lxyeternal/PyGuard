{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes and functions from a module related to prompt hot reloading and defines module exports and version information.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing from 'prompt_hot_reloading.prompt_registry'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only performs imports and defines module metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements, module export definitions, and a version string. There are no functions, data processing, or external calls that could indicate malicious behavior. The imported module 'prompt_hot_reloading.prompt_registry' could contain malicious code, but from this snippet alone, it cannot be determined. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard module setup code with no malicious behavior or security issues evident. The potential risk depends on the contents of the imported module, which is outside the scope of this snippet.",
