  "purpose": "Module setup importing PromptRegistry and create_prompt_registry, defining exports and version.",
  "sources": "Import statements from prompt_hot_reloading.prompt_registry",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external output",
  "flows": "Import from prompt_hot_reloading.prompt_registry to module namespace",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export, no dynamic code or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports specific classes/functions and exposes them via __all__, along with setting a version string. No external data, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The imported module's content is unknown, but the snippet itself shows no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The minimal risk score (0.1) in report 4 accounts for the dependency uncertainty, but the code itself is benign. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero, consistent with the straightforward static import pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The slight risk score reflects dependency trust concerns but is justified given the lack of evidence of malicious behavior in this snippet.",
