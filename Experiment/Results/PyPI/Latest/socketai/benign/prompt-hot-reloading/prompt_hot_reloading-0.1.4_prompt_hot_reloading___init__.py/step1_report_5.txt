  "purpose": "Defines module exports and version information for prompt_hot_reloading package.",
  "sources": "Imports from prompt_hot_reloading.prompt_registry, specifically PromptRegistry and create_prompt_registry.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or potentially sensitive operations detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; simply imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions/classes from an internal module and exposes them via __all__, along with setting a version string. There are no data processing, no input/output operations, and no code execution or network activity. The code is straightforward and typical for a module's __init__.py or public interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple module interface setup with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
