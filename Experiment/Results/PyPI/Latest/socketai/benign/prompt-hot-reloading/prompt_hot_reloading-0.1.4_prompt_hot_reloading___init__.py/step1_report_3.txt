  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no user input or external data sources are involved.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and defines module-level variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. The code appears standard for module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes/functions from a local module and defines module exports and version info. There is no dynamic code execution, data handling, or network activity. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python modules. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple module initializer with no malicious behavior or security issues identified.",
