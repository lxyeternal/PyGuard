  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module setup: importing specific functions/classes, defining `__all__`, and setting `__version__`.\n- No reports mention dynamic code execution, external data handling, network activity, or user input.\n- The code snippets are simple and consistent across reports, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n- The only potential concern raised is in report 4, which notes that the imported module `prompt_hot_reloading.prompt_registry` could contain malicious code, but from this snippet alone, there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  The reports mainly conclude that the code is benign and straightforward. No actual malicious code, data flow, or anomalies are present in the snippet.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that this code is a simple module interface with no malicious behavior.\n- No errors, flaws, or reasoning mistakes are evident.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0, with report 4 assigning a 0.1 due to the potential risk in the imported module. This is reasonable, as the actual code here doesn't introduce risks, but the imported module's integrity is outside this snippet's scope.\n\n### Justifications for risk scores:\n- Since all code is static import/export, with no external input or dynamic behavior, a high risk score is unwarranted.\n- The minimal security risk assigned in report 4 (0.1) is justified due to the potential of malicious code in the imported module, but this is speculative based on the snippet alone.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 - 0.1 (low, based on the potential risk in imported module, but the code itself is benign)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a simple, benign module setup with no signs of malicious activity. The minimal concern about the imported module's content is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes needed to scores.\n- The actual risk is very low; the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The security risk score can stay at 0 or 0.1, reflecting the slight concern about the imported module's integrity, but given the evidence, 0 is justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nSet **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **risk = 0**.",
