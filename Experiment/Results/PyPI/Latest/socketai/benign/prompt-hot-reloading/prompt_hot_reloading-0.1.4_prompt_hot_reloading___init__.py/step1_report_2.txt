  "purpose": "Defines module exports and version information for prompt_hot_reloading package.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing PromptRegistry and create_prompt_registry from prompt_hot_reloading.prompt_registry",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data output, external calls, or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; simple import and export declarations",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions/classes from a local module and defines export variables, including __all__ and __version__. It is straightforward and contains no dynamic code, no data processing, and no external interactions beyond static imports. The code appears to be part of a module's initialization or configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
