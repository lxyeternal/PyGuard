  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The code is straightforward, importing from `prompt_hot_reloading.prompt_registry` and defining `__all__` and `__version__`.\n- No data flows, external inputs, or suspicious code.\n- The conclusion of benignity is justified.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. These seem appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with the same import and export pattern.\n- No external data handling or dynamic code.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern, straightforward import and module metadata.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slightly more cautious, notes that the imported module could contain malicious code but cannot be determined from this snippet.\n- The security risk is set at 0.1, malware=0, obfuscated=0.\n- Given the code only performs imports and exports, and no suspicious activity is evident, this cautious score seems reasonable.\n- The confidence is slightly lower (0.9), which is appropriate given the dependency concern.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to previous reports, simple import/export, no suspicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, justified.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign and straightforward.\n- The only potential concern is the imported module `prompt_hot_reloading.prompt_registry`. Since the code itself is simple, the risk is primarily dependent on the contents of that module.\n- The scores assigned (all zero for malware, obfuscated, and low for risk in Report 4) are appropriate given the evidence.\n- No report suggests any actual malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities in this snippet.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code appears to be a standard module setup with no malicious intent.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- Obfuscation is not present.\n- The overall security risk is minimal, mainly dependent on the imported module's trustworthiness.\n\n### Suggested scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for dependency trust, but very low)\n\nThis aligns with the cautious note in Report 4 but reflects the lack of actual malicious indicators.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- The minimal risk score accounts for dependency trust but is otherwise negligible.\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis of the imported module is required.",
