{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for prompt sources with methods to load prompts and watch for changes.",
  "sources": "Code imports (abc, typing), class definition, abstract method declarations",
  "sinks": "None present; no data processing or external communication implemented",
  "flows": "No executable flows; only abstract method signatures with documentation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and only defines an interface",
  "analysis": "The code creates an abstract class with two methods: load_all and watch, both abstract. The load_all method is meant to return a dictionary of prompts; the watch method sets up background watching for prompt changes. There are no data processing, input handling, or external communications. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The structure aligns with typical interface design for prompt management, and no obfuscation or malware signals are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard interface definition for prompt source management, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is safe and has no embedded malicious intent.",
