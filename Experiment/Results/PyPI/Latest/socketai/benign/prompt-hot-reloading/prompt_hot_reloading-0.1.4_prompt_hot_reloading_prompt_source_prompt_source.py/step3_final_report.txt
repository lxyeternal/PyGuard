  "purpose": "Define an interface for prompt sources with methods to load prompts and watch for changes.",
  "sources": "Method signatures in load_all() and watch() functions, and the class definition itself.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present; purely abstract method signatures.",
  "flows": "No data flow; methods are abstract with no implementation.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward interface with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple abstract base class with two abstract methods, serving as an interface. It contains no executable logic, data processing, external calls, or obfuscation. The comments clarify intended behavior but do not introduce security risks. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's benign nature is consistent across all reports, and the assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured interface with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its nature and assign appropriate scores. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
