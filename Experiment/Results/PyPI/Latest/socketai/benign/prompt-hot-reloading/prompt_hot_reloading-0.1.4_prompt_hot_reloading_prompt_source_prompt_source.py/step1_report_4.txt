  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for managing prompt sources with methods to load prompts and monitor changes.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only class and method definitions without runtime input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs since the code is purely declarative and defines interfaces.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard Python features for abstract base classes and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'PromptSource' with two abstract methods: 'load_all' which should return a dictionary of prompt names to texts, and 'watch' which accepts a callback to be invoked upon prompt changes. There are no runtime input sources, no data sinks, and no suspicious logic. The use of threading in comments is standard for such watcher implementations but is only described, not implemented. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward interface declaration for prompt management. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, does not process untrusted data, and poses no security risks.",
