{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for prompt source management with methods to load prompts and watch for changes.",
  "sources": "Class definition and method signatures, no external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that could lead to data leaks or effects; methods are abstract and unimplemented.",
  "flows": "No data flows are explicitly implemented; abstract methods outline intended behavior but contain no code logic.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; code is straightforward, defining an interface with no implementation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with two abstract methods: load_all and watch. Both methods are properly annotated and documented, with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious code, or obfuscated elements. The code appears to serve as a standard interface for subclasses to implement prompt source management functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical abstract class definition for managing prompt sources. It contains no executable code, no data processing, and no suspicious behavior. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
