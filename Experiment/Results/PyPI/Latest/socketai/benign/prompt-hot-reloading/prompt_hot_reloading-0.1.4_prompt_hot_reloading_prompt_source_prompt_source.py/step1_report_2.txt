  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for prompt sources with methods to load all prompts and watch for changes.",
  "sources": "Class definition and method declarations, including abstract methods load_all and watch.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data handling, external calls, or untrusted input processing observed.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow or source-to-sink pathways identified; code only declares an interface.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'PromptSource' with two abstract methods: load_all and watch. The methods are documented to handle prompt data loading and change monitoring, respectively. There are no implementations, runtime data handling, or external dependencies that could pose security risks. No malicious behavior or sabotage evident. The code appears to serve as an interface for subclasses.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward abstract base class defining an interface for prompt data sources. It contains no executable or malicious code, no hidden behaviors, and does not perform any data processing or network operations. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
