  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is a standard abstract class with no implementation, data handling, or external interactions.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** None. The reasoning correctly identifies the code as a typical interface.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. This aligns well with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely structural; no malicious or risky behavior detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Same as above, a straightforward interface.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** None. The report correctly states no anomalies or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No runtime logic, data processing, or external dependencies.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code remains an interface with no implementation.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** None. The report accurately notes the absence of anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Correct.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The description remains consistent with a pure interface.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** None. The report correctly emphasizes the lack of data flow or external interaction.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No executable code or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is just an interface with no implementation.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** None. The analysis correctly states that the code is safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Correct.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code contains no executable logic, external calls, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward interface code.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured abstract class interface with no embedded malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- There are no assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities that are unsupported by the code.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.",
