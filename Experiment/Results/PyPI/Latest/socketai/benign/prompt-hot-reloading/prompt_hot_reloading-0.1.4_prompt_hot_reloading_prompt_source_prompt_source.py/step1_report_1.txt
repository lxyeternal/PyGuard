  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for prompt sources with methods to load prompts and watch for changes.",
  "sources": "Method definitions with abstract methods, no data input reading or external data sources in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could be processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this code as it only defines an interface with no implementation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of abstract methods without implementation is standard for interfaces; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward abstract class definition using Python's ABC module, defining two abstract methods: 'load_all' and 'watch'. These methods specify the expected interface for subclasses. No data processing, external input reading, or network communication occurs here. The code does not include any dynamic execution, code injection, or suspicious behavior. It solely establishes an interface, which is common in well-structured Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard abstract class for a prompt source interface with no malicious or suspicious content. It simply specifies method signatures for subclasses to implement, with no evident security risks or malicious behavior.",
