  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious or suspicious elements, the accuracy of the scores, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a simple abstract class with two abstract methods: `load_all()` and `watch()`.\n- No implementation details, external data sources, network communication, or data processing are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n- The purpose is to define an interface for prompt sources, which is common in modular systems.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code itself does not contain any executable logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n- It is purely an interface definition, so there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors to be found here.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports are consistent in stating that the code is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious content.\n- They correctly identify that the code is an interface with no data processing or external calls.\n- No flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n### Scores Analysis:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The confidence score is 1, which is justified since the analysis is thorough and accurate.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- Since there is no executable code, no data handling, and no external interactions, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The malware score is correctly 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- Obfuscation is correctly scored as 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- Security risk is correctly scored as 0, given the lack of any security-sensitive operations.\n\n### Potential Misinterpretations:\n- The only point to consider is that, as an interface, this code could be extended maliciously in subclasses, but that is outside the scope of this snippet.\n- The current code itself does not pose any security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard interface definition with no malicious or suspicious elements. It neither processes untrusted data nor performs any external communication. The scores assigned by all reports are appropriate and should remain at zero.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and no security issues are present. The scores should remain at zero across all categories.",
