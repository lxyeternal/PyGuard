{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for polling an S3 bucket for prompt files, loading them, and monitoring for changes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from S3 objects via boto3 client, specifically list_objects_v2 and get_object calls to retrieve object content and metadata.",
  "sinks": "Processes object contents and metadata; calls to on_change callback with filename and content.",
  "flows": "Uses list_objects_v2 to identify new or updated objects based on LastModified timestamps, then reads object data and triggers callback if updated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code patterns; standard usage of boto3 for S3 access; no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code safely interacts with AWS S3, using standard SDK calls to list and retrieve objects. It tracks modification times to detect updates, preventing unnecessary reads. No suspicious or malicious activities, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors, are evident. Threading is used for polling, which is common. No hardcoded secrets or insecure practices are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation for polling S3 objects for prompt data updates. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, benign component for a prompt-loading system.",
