{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for polling an AWS S3 bucket for prompt files, loading them, and watching for changes to trigger callbacks.",
  "sources": "Reads data from AWS S3 bucket objects, specifically list_objects_v2 and get_object API calls; reads object content via .read().decode().",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data read from S3 objects used as prompts; no direct output or external system interactions besides AWS API calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from S3 objects (sources) through get_object() into in-memory strings (prompts), with change detection triggering callbacks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets or credentials present; standard use of boto3. The polling mechanism runs in a background thread.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes boto3 to access AWS S3, fetching objects based on a prefix, and decoding their contents. It tracks modification times to detect changes and invokes callbacks. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are evident. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage appears to be for prompt management via S3 storage. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data are found; dependency on AWS credentials is standard for boto3.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation for polling S3 for prompt files, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for prompt source management, with standard AWS SDK usage and no suspicious patterns.",
