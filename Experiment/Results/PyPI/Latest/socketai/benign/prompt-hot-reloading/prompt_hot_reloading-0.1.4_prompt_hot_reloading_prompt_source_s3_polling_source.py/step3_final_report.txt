  "purpose": "A class implementing polling of an S3 bucket for prompt files, loading and monitoring changes via threading.",
  "sources": "list_objects_v2 and get_object calls to S3, reading object bodies, timestamps from LastModified.",
  "sinks": "Callback invocation on detected changes; no data exfiltration or malicious actions observed.",
  "flows": "Listing objects -> Comparing timestamps -> Fetching updated objects -> Triggering on_change callback.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of S3 polling using boto3, threading, and timestamp comparison. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. It relies on external AWS credentials, which are assumed to be managed securely outside the code. No signs of data leakage, code injection, or backdoors. The code's logic is standard and benign, with minimal security risk primarily due to external data source dependency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for polling S3 for prompt files, with no malicious or obfuscated components. Security risks are minimal and primarily operational. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.15, reflecting negligible inherent risk.",
