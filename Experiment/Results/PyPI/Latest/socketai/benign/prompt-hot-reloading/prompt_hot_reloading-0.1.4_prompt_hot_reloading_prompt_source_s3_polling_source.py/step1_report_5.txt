{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for polling an S3 bucket for prompt files and triggering a callback on updates, likely for dynamic prompt management.",
  "sources": "Reads data from AWS S3 objects via boto3's get_object method, and list_objects_v2 for listing objects in a bucket.",
  "sinks": "Calls on_change callback with the prompt name and content upon detecting updates, and reads object contents into memory.",
  "flows": "list_objects_v2 retrieves object list -> get_object retrieves object content -> on_change callback is triggered with new data.",
  "anomalies": "Uses threading for continuous polling, which could potentially be misused to create resource exhaustion if misconfigured. No hardcoded credentials are present, but sensitive data handling depends on AWS credentials configured outside the code.",
  "analysis": "The code securely interacts with AWS S3 using boto3, with standard methods for listing and retrieving objects. No suspicious or malicious code behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors is apparent. The threading implementation enables continuous monitoring but does not introduce malicious intent by itself. No hardcoded secrets are visible, and the data flow is straightforward. The code could be used maliciously if an attacker manipulated the S3 bucket content, but as written, it functions as intended for dynamic prompt updates. No obfuscated or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for polling an S3 bucket for prompt updates, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It performs expected data retrieval and callback invocation in a controlled manner.",
