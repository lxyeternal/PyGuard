  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward factory function that reads environment variables to instantiate either an S3PollingSource or a FileSystemSource.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n- Environment variables are used for configuration, which is standard practice.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or backdoors.\n- The code does not perform any network operations directly; external resource access depends on the environment configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n\n- **Presence of Issues in Code:**  \n  The code itself appears correct and does not contain obvious vulnerabilities or bugs. The environment variables are used appropriately, with defaults provided where applicable.\n\n- **Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**  \n  None of the reports identify malicious intent or malware. They correctly interpret the code as a configuration-driven factory pattern.\n\n- **Sensitive Data Handling:**  \n  The code accesses environment variables that may contain sensitive information (e.g., `PROMPT_S3_BUCKET`). However, it does not handle secrets directly; credentials are expected to be supplied via environment variables, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. This is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is consistent given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  The risk scores are mostly 0.1 or 0.2, indicating low risk. This seems reasonable, considering the code's purpose and lack of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Discrepancies or Over/Underestimation:\n\n- The reports are consistent in their assessments.  \n- Given the code's simplicity and the lack of any suspicious activity, I agree with the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code functions as a configuration-based factory for setting up data sources.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present.\n- Environment variables are used in a standard way, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting minimal security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, standard configuration code)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears safe, standard, and free of security issues. The reports are accurate, and I concur with their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the code itself is safe, the security posture depends on how environment variables are managed and secured in deployment. Proper environment variable management and secret handling practices should be enforced outside this code snippet.",
