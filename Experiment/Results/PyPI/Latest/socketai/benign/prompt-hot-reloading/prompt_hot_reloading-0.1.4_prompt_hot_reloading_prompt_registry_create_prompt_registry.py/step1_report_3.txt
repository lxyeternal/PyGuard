{
  "purpose": "Creates and returns a PromptRegistry object based on environment variables, selecting either a file system source or an S3 polling source.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables PROMPT_SOURCE, PROMPT_S3_BUCKET, PROMPT_S3_PREFIX, PROMPT_S3_POLL_INTERVAL, PROMPT_DIR",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables directly in initializing S3PollingSource and FileSystemSource; no direct untrusted input sink, but environment variables influence behavior",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read as sources, influencing the creation of either S3PollingSource or FileSystemSource objects",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or unusual behaviors; the code is straightforward and typical for configuration-based object creation",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves configuration data from environment variables to determine which prompt source to instantiate. It carefully handles default values and converts input to appropriate types. No malicious or maliciously intended code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are evident within this module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration-driven factory function without malicious intent. It correctly reads environment variables to determine the source type and instantiates appropriate classes. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
