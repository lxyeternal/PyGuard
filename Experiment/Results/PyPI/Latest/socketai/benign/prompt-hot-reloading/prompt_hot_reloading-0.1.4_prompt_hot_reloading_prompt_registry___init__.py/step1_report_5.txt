{
  "purpose": "The code re-exports specific classes and functions from other modules within the same package for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'prompt_hot_reloading.prompt_registry.prompt_registry' and 'prompt_hot_reloading.prompt_registry.create_prompt_registry'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs; the code only imports and defines exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two components from internal modules and exposes them via __all__, which is typical for Python packages to control namespace exports. There is no evidence of data handling, input processing, or untrusted data flows. The structure is standard and lacks any suspicious patterns or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module that manages exports of classes and functions within a package. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
