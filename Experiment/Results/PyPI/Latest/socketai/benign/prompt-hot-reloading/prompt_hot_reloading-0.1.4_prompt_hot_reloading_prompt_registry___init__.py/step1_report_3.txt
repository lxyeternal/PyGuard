  "purpose": "The code exports specific classes and functions related to prompt registry management, likely for a larger system involving hot reloading of prompts.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'prompt_hot_reloading.prompt_registry' modules: 'prompt_registry' and 'create_prompt_registry'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; code only defines exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs; import statements load modules, then the exports are defined.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, defining what is exported. There are no functions, data processing, or network operations. No potential for malicious behavior, data leaks, or code injection is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module exporting certain components. No malicious or security-related issues are present based on this snippet.",
