{
  "purpose": "The code exports two components, 'PromptRegistry' and 'create_prompt_registry', likely for use in managing or creating prompt registry instances in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'prompt_hot_reloading.prompt_registry' modules, which may load classes or functions related to prompt management.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external network access, or sensitive data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed as the code only performs imports and exports; no runtime data processing occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports two components from local modules and defines the __all__ attribute to export them. It does not contain any dynamic code execution, data handling, or security-sensitive operations. The code appears straightforward and standard for module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as an interface to expose specific classes or functions from imported modules.",
