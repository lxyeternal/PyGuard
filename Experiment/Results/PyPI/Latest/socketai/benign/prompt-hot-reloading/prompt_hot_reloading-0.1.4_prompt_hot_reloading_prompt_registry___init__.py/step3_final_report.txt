  "purpose": "This code module imports specific classes/functions from internal modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules prompt_hot_reloading.prompt_registry.prompt_registry and create_prompt_registry.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only performs static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports components and defines __all__ for exports. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling is present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
