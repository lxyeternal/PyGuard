  "review": "Let's systematically analyze these reports and the code snippet.\n\n**1. Confirm presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code is a straightforward module that imports two components (`PromptRegistry` and `create_prompt_registry`) and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no dynamic code, data handling, or external interactions.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as a simple re-export module.\n- No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n**3. Review the scores assigned:**\n- All reports assign `malware`, `obfuscated`, and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate.\n- No adjustments seem necessary based on the code's simplicity.\n\n**4. Justify risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- The risk scores are all 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n- No evidence suggests any security threat or malicious intent.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n- The malware score of 0 across reports is appropriate.\n\n**6. Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities:**\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report:**\n- Scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Code Evaluation:**\n- The code is a minimal, straightforward module that imports and re-exports components.\n- No security risks, malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese match the reports' assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified. No further action or concern is necessary.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- Maintain the current scoring.\n- No additional security review needed for this snippet.\n\n**End of review.**",
