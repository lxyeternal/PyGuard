  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code solely performs import statements from internal modules (`prompt_hot_reloading.prompt_registry`) and defines the `__all__` attribute to specify what is exported.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, network calls, dynamic code execution, or any other operations beyond simple imports and exports.\n   - The code is a standard pattern for exposing specific components in a Python module.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - None of the reports identify any anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, suspicious code constructs, or external data handling.\n   - The code appears straightforward and benign, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Security Risks and Data Flows**:\n   - The reports correctly note that there are no data flows involving untrusted sources, no sinks, and no external inputs or outputs.\n   - The code does not process any data, so the risk of data leaks or injection is nonexistent here.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1\n   - These assessments are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Concerns**:\n   - Given the code's minimal and standard nature, there are no reasons to adjust the scores.\n   - The reports do not make any assumptions about vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n6. **Summary and Final Assessment**:\n   - **Malware Score**: Should remain at 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: Should remain at 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score**: Should be 0, reflecting no security concern.\n   - **Confidence**: Should stay at 1, given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n**Final Justification**:\nThis code is a typical module re-export pattern with no malicious or security-sensitive operations. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Security Risk**: 0\n\nThese reflect the benign and straightforward nature of the code snippet.",
