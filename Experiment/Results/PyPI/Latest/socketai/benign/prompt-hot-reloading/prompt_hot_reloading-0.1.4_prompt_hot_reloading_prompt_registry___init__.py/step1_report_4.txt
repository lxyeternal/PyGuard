{
  "purpose": "The code exports two components, PromptRegistry and create_prompt_registry, likely for use elsewhere in a project related to prompt management or hot-reloading functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing PromptRegistry and create_prompt_registry from specific modules within the prompt_hot_reloading package.",
  "sinks": "The __all__ assignment exporting the imported components; no other data sinks or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Imports are used to bring in specific classes/functions; the __all__ list exports these for module external use. No data flow beyond module import/export is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, such as obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic execution. The code appears straightforward and standard for a Python module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two items from a package, then explicitly exports them via the __all__ variable, enabling controlled namespace exposure. There are no user inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The code is minimal, clear, and standard for Python modules defining public API components.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and standard for a module that re-exports selected classes/functions for external use. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues are evident.",
