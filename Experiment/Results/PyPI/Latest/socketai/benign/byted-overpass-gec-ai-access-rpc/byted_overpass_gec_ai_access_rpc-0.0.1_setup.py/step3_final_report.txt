  "purpose": "This code is a standard setup.py script for a Python package, serving as a placeholder to mitigate dependency confusion risks.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.md' for long_description, and package metadata such as name, version, author, url, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; the code does not process user input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script only defines package metadata and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py for a placeholder package with no embedded malicious code or suspicious behavior. All reports are empty, providing no additional evidence or concerns. The package's purpose as a placeholder aligns with a benign intent. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. Given the lack of detailed reports or evidence, the overall security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The package appears benign, serving as a placeholder to prevent dependency confusion. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident from the code or reports. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should be set to zero or very low, reflecting the benign nature of the package.",
