  "purpose": "Ethereum transaction signing and broadcasting for token swaps, utilizing private keys and network APIs.",
  "sources": "Input data from configuration, API responses for balances, gas, nonce, and price; user-supplied private key.",
  "sinks": "Network request to RPC endpoint for transaction submission; logs for trade records.",
  "flows": "Config/API data → transaction creation and signing → signed transaction sent over network → logs and trade records updated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity, no hidden backdoors or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Ethereum transaction signing using ecdsa and rlp encoding, then broadcasts via JSON-RPC. Error handling is present. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected. Private key handling is typical for such scripts but always sensitive. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and the analysis. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Ethereum trading utility, performing expected operations securely. It shows no malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The low risk score reflects inherent operational risks but no malicious activity.",
