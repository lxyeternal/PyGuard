{
  "purpose": "The code fetches token prices via RPC calls, calculates volatility, and identifies the token with the highest volatility.",
  "sources": "safe_rpc function call in fetch_price method; input tokens list; data returned from RPC call.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present that process untrusted data beyond data fetching; data is used for calculations and logging.",
  "flows": "Input tokens -> fetch_price (RPC call) -> process data -> store last prices -> score_tokens -> determine best token.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no malicious or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses a safe RPC wrapper for external calls, processes token data for volatility scoring, and handles exceptions with logging. No signs of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful behavior are evident. The logic appears to be a legitimate token volatility analysis tool. No hidden or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign token scoring mechanism based on price volatility. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks based on this analysis.",
