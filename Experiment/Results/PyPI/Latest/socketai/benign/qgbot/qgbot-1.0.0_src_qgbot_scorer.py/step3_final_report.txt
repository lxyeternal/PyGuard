{
  "purpose": "Fetches token prices via an external RPC call, parses the data, calculates volatility based on previous prices, and selects the token with the highest volatility exceeding a threshold.",
  "sources": "The safe_rpc function call to fetch data; the data slice data[130:194] for price extraction.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks or untrusted data sinks; the data is fetched and parsed internally, with logging for errors.",
  "flows": "External RPC response -> parse hexadecimal substring -> convert to Decimal -> compare with last stored prices -> update last prices -> determine volatility -> select best token.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard token price fetching and volatility scoring. It relies on an external utility 'safe_rpc' whose trustworthiness is outside this code's scope. Parsing logic assumes a fixed response format, which could be fragile but is not inherently malicious. Exception handling is appropriate. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The main security concern is external dependency trust, not the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the trust in the external 'safe_rpc' utility. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score of 0.2 reflects the external dependency trust concern, which is reasonable given the context.",
