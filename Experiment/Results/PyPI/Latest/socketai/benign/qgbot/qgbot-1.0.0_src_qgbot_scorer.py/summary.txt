  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the trust in the external 'safe_rpc' utility. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score of 0.2 reflects the external dependency trust concern, which is reasonable given the context."
