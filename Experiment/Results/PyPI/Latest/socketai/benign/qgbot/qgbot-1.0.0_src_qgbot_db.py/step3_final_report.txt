  "purpose": "A thread-safe Python class for logging trade data into a local SQLite database, managing connection, schema creation, and data insertion.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to log_trade method (timestamp, action, tx_hash, eth_price, eth_amount).",
  "sinks": "Database insert operation using parameterized query; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the execute method via parameterized query, then into the database.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with proper exception handling and thread safety. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard, thread-safe database handler for logging trades. It uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, manages connection and schema creation properly, and handles exceptions with logging. No malicious behavior, external communication, or obfuscation is present. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to local data storage without validation or encryption, but this is acceptable given the scope. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1, reflecting a very low residual risk. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9+).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, secure, and well-structured, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
