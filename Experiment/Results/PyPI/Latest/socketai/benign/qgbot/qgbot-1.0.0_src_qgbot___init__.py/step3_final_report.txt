  "purpose": "A modular Ethereum-based trading bot designed for grid trading, volatility scoring, and on-chain transaction execution.",
  "sources": "Configuration files (e.g., config.json), utility modules for RPC calls, cryptographic functions, and transaction signing routines.",
  "sinks": "Ethereum RPC endpoints for transaction broadcasting, cryptographic signing functions, and local SQLite database for trade logging.",
  "flows": "Input data from configuration and RPC responses flow into transaction creation, signing, and broadcasting modules; trade logs are stored in the database.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or covert network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, open-source Ethereum trading bot with clear modular design. It handles sensitive data externally, uses standard cryptographic functions, and interacts with Ethereum nodes for trading. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.2) are consistent with the code's features and potential external handling of secrets. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious payloads are identified. The low risk score appropriately reflects the typical security considerations of such applications, primarily related to secret management outside the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and primarily concerns external secret handling. The scores assigned are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
