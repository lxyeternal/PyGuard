{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for interacting with Ethereum blockchain via JSON-RPC, including fetching prices, balances, gas prices, nonces, and encoding swap transactions.",
  "sources": "Network requests via safe_rpc to configured RPC endpoint, data inputs for encoding functions, environment variables for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Network calls to RPC endpoint, transaction data construction, logging of errors.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (addresses, method calls) flow into network requests and encoding functions; responses from RPC endpoints are processed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; reliance on external RPC endpoint introduces external trust risk but not malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Ethereum blockchain interactions, including RPC calls for data retrieval and transaction encoding. It uses cryptographic functions and RLP encoding in a conventional manner. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Error handling is typical; logs could potentially leak info if exposed. The main external risk stems from trusting the RPC endpoint URL, which is configurable. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard blockchain utility library with no detected malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, primarily reflecting external endpoint trustworthiness rather than internal vulnerabilities. No malware or obfuscation concerns are justified based on the code analysis.",
