  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain, including RPC calls, data encoding, and price/balance retrieval.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data (set_config), RPC responses (safe_rpc), input parameters for encoding and RPC calls, blockchain data (blockchain responses).",
  "sinks": "Potentially exposes sensitive data through RPC calls, constructs transaction data payloads, and reads blockchain data that could be used for further malicious activities if misused.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows into RPC functions, which call blockchain endpoints. Data from RPC responses is parsed and used for calculations or further encoding. Input parameters flow into encoding functions, which produce data payloads for transactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network calls are present. Functions perform standard blockchain interactions and data processing. No evidence of obfuscation, secret exfiltration, or hidden malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard blockchain utility functions, including RPC communication, data encoding (RLP), and data retrieval (price, balance, gas, nonce). These functions use explicit configurations and standard libraries. The encoding functions follow typical Ethereum data encoding conventions. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or hidden backdoors is apparent. The logging is limited to error reporting, and no sensitive data is hardcoded. All functions appear to serve legitimate purposes related to blockchain interactions. The use of standard cryptographic functions and data encoding aligns with common blockchain tooling, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of utility functions for Ethereum blockchain interaction, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs typical RPC calls, data encoding, and data retrieval tasks that are common in blockchain applications. No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Overall security risk appears low.",
