  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard blockchain utility library with no detected malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, primarily reflecting external endpoint trustworthiness rather than internal vulnerabilities. No malware or obfuscation concerns are justified based on the code analysis."
