{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and manages the lifecycle of a trading bot system, including starting, running, and gracefully shutting down components such as database and master controller.",
  "sources": "Imports modules: logging, time, signal, and local modules core.MasterController and db.TradeDatabase.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present. The code interacts with internal classes and system signals only.",
  "flows": "Code initializes database and controller, starts processes, and waits in a loop; handles signals to trigger shutdown, which calls cleanup methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated elements observed.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up logging, initializes database and controller objects, and runs an infinite loop awaiting signals for shutdown. Signal handling is correctly implemented for graceful termination. The code appears standard for managing application lifecycle. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands. All interactions are with internal modules presumed to be legitimate, and no external untrusted data sources are processed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward application controller for a trading bot system with no apparent malicious intent. It manages internal components and system signals securely, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
