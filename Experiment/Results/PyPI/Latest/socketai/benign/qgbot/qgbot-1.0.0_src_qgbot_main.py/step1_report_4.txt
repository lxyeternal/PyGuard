{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and manages the lifecycle of a trading bot system, starting, running, and shutting down components such as a master controller and a database connection.",
  "sources": "Import statements, constructor (__init__), start() method (initializes database and master controller), run() method (waits in a loop), signal handlers (handle_signal), and the shutdown() method.",
  "sinks": "Logging calls (logging.info), signal handling, database closing (self.db.close()), and stopping the master controller (self.master.stop_all()).",
  "flows": "Initialization (import, __init__) -> start() -> run() -> handle_signal() or KeyboardInterrupt -> shutdown() -> closing database and stopping master controller.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward application lifecycle manager. It imports standard libraries and local modules, sets up logging, and manages startup and shutdown procedures. Signal handling is properly implemented to ensure graceful termination. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or unauthorized access. The only external interactions are logging and closing database connections, which are standard. No suspicious anomalies or code behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a typical system controller for a trading bot framework with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It manages system start, runtime, and shutdown cleanly without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
