{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and manages a trading bot system, setting up logging, database, and controller components, then runs an infinite loop until interrupted.",
  "sources": "TradeDatabase() instantiation, MasterController(self.db) instantiation, signal handlers for SIGINT and SIGTERM, user input via signals, time.sleep() loop.",
  "sinks": "Shutdown procedures, stopping all master processes, closing database connection.",
  "flows": "Signals received -> handle_signal() -> shutdown() -> stop_all() and db.close()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. No external network calls or data exfiltration activities are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a controlled environment for running a trading system with proper signal handling and logging. It initializes database and controller objects and runs an idle loop awaiting termination signals. No external data sources or sinks that could be malicious are observed. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious logic; it follows standard practices for service shutdown and resource cleanup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard application framework for managing a trading bot system without any malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. No security risks are identified based on the provided code.",
