{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and runs a trading bot system, managing database and controller components, handling signals for shutdown.",
  "sources": "TradeDatabase() instantiation, MasterController(self.db) instantiation, signal handling, input signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM)",
  "sinks": "Database close operation, master.stop_all() method, logging outputs",
  "flows": "Initialization of database and master controller -> signal handling triggers -> shutdown procedures involving database closing and stopping bots",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious input/output, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated or malicious functions",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard system setup and graceful shutdown procedures for a trading bot. It initializes a database and controller, manages signals for termination, and includes a main loop that keeps the system running. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or hidden backdoors. The use of logging and signal handling is typical for such applications, and no suspicious code or external network activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward system management script for a trading bot. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code is clean, well-structured, and shows no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
