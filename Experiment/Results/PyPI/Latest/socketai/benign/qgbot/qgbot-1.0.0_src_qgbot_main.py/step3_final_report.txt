{
  "purpose": "Manages the startup, operation, and shutdown of a trading bot system, initializing core components and handling system signals for graceful termination.",
  "sources": "Initialization of TradeDatabase and MasterController objects, reading system signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network or data exfiltration activities detected.",
  "flows": "System signals trigger handle_signal, which leads to shutdown procedures; main loop sleeps idle, awaiting signals.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; straightforward lifecycle management.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard application controller that initializes core modules, manages signals for graceful shutdown, and runs an idle loop. No suspicious behaviors, external network activity, or malicious code are present. The code structure is clear, with proper resource cleanup. The signal handling and logging are correctly implemented. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are evident. The code's benign nature is supported by the absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The assigned malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis; security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal operational risk. Overall, the code appears secure and well-structured, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard system lifecycle manager for a trading bot, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
