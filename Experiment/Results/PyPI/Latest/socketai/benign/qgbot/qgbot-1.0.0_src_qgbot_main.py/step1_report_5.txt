{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and runs a trading bot system, managing a master controller and a trade database, with signal handling for shutdown.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules (logging, time, signal, local modules core and db), class methods reading configuration and state variables.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs, method calls to start and stop components, database connection closure.",
  "flows": "Initialization creates database and master controller objects; signal handlers trigger shutdown procedures; run loop maintains process until interrupted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code structure is standard for a service controller.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up logging and signal handling, initializes core components (MasterController and TradeDatabase), and runs an infinite loop until a termination signal is received. The signal handling properly initiates shutdown procedures, closing database connections and stopping controllers. There are no suspicious code injection points, obfuscated segments, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be a typical service orchestration script for a trading bot system.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward process manager for a trading system with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It handles signals and shutdown cleanly, with no indicators of security risks or hidden malicious intent.",
