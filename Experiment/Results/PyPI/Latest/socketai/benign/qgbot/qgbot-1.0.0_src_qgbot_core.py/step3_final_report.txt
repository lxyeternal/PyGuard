  "purpose": "Orchestrates trading components by initializing wallet, executor, grid bot, and rebalancer, then starts their run methods in separate threads.",
  "sources": "Initialization of DynamicWallet, TradeExecutor, GridBot, RebalanceBot; invocation of their run methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network operations are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Creates instances of wallet, executor, grid bot, rebalancer; starts their run methods in daemon threads.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward orchestrator for a trading system, initializing components and running their processes asynchronously. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are evident within this fragment. The imported modules are external and their internal security cannot be assessed here, but the code itself is benign. The threading approach is standard, and no data leaks or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign orchestration component with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
