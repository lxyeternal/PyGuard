  "purpose": "Initialize and start multiple trading bots and related components for automated trading.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes; creates instances of wallet, executor, grid bot, and rebalancer.",
  "sinks": "Calls run methods of gridbot and rebalancer in separate threads.",
  "flows": "Initialization of components -> start_all() method invoked -> threads launched executing gridbot.run and rebalancer.run.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, creates instances of wallet, executor, grid bot, and rebalancer classes, and starts their processes in separate threads. There are no hardcoded secrets or malicious network actions. The structure appears typical for a trading automation setup. No indicators of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code appears to be part of a larger trading system, with no suspicious activity within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of initializing and running trading bots in separate threads. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It is a benign component of an automated trading system.",
