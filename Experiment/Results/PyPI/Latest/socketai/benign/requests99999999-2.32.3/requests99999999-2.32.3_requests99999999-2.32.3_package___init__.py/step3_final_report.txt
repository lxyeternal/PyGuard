{
  "purpose": "The code is a Python package intended for data processing and network communication, with no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from environment variables, function parameters, or external files; network connections for data transmission or retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to network endpoints, files, or system logs; potential for data leakage if untrusted data is transmitted without validation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables) through processing functions to sinks (network, file outputs). No malicious data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Some complex or obscure code patterns noted, but no hardcoded secrets, suspicious domains, or backdoors detected. No obfuscation or malicious code signatures.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard utility module with network capabilities. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. Obfuscation is minimal (score 0.2 in report 3), justified by some complexity but not malicious. The confidence in benign assessment is high (0.8-0.75). The security risk is low (0.2-0.3), mainly due to network operations and potential obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns are present. The overall evaluation aligns with the scores assigned in the reports.",
  "conclusion": "The package is benign with no detected malware or malicious intent. Slight obfuscation or complexity does not elevate risk significantly. Scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.2,
