  "purpose": "A standard Python setup script defining package metadata with no dynamic or malicious code.",
  "sources": "Static parameters within the setup() function, including package name, version, description, author, and packages list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data inputs; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "N/A – all parameters are static; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious package name 'requests99999999' resembling the popular 'requests' library, potentially used for deception or mimicry.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic inputs, code execution, or obfuscation. The only notable anomaly is the package name, which could be intended to deceive users. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the context. The code itself is benign, but the package name warrants cautious consideration in a supply chain context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with a suspicious package name that could be used for deceptive purposes. No malware or obfuscation detected. The low security risk score is justified, but the package name should be monitored if distributed. Overall, the assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
