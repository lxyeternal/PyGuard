  "purpose": "Unit tests for the function write_xcom_to_file, verifying normal operation and various error conditions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to write_xcom_to_file, temporary file paths, filesystem operations such as open, chmod.",
  "sinks": "File system writes, permission modifications, exception raising for invalid inputs or permission errors.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> validation checks -> file creation/opening -> write operation -> exception handling for errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of unit tests covering normal and error scenarios for file writing. It manipulates filesystem permissions in a controlled manner, handles exceptions, and verifies expected behavior. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk between 0 and 0.2) are consistent with the code's nature and context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard testing suite with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified given the controlled environment. No adjustments are necessary.",
