  "purpose": "Unit tests for the write_xcom_to_file function in the thinknet_airflow_dag_artifact module, verifying correct behavior and error handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to write_xcom_to_file, such as file paths and values; reading from temporary files created during tests.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations within write_xcom_to_file, reading files to verify content.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → write_xcom_to_file (which writes to files); exceptions thrown based on input validation or file access errors.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. Use of os.chmod to set file permissions is standard for permission testing; no obfuscation or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit testing on the write_xcom_to_file function, checking for proper handling of various inputs and error scenarios, including invalid paths, permission errors, and non-serializable data. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity is evident. The tests are standard, focusing on validation and exception handling. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or harmful operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of unit tests for a file writing utility with comprehensive validation checks. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. The overall security risk is negligible, and there are no indicators of supply chain attacks or malware.",
