  "sources": "Input parameters to write_xcom_to_file function: airflow_xcom_path and value.",
  "sinks": "File system writes performed by write_xcom_to_file; reading files in test assertions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> write_xcom_to_file -> File system write operations",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed. The tests involve file system operations and exception handling, typical for validation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code contains several unit tests for a function that writes data to files. It tests valid writes, invalid paths, permission errors, and non-serializable data. The code interacts only with the file system and performs standard exception handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors. Usage of environment variables, code injection, or obfuscation is absent. All file operations seem intentional and related to testing the core functionality. No anomalies suggest malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of standard unit tests validating file writing and exception handling for a specific function. It does not contain malware or malicious intent, and the security risk is minimal. The code appears safe and typical for testing purposes.",
