  "purpose": "Re-exporting utility functions for reading from S3, writing to S3, and writing XCom data to a file.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'thinknet_airflow_dag_artifact' modules: 'spark_utilities' and 'xcom_utilities'.",
  "sinks": "Exports of functions that could be called elsewhere; no direct data sinks or untrusted data handling shown.",
  "flows": "Imported functions are available for external use; no explicit data flow or execution logic present.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward re-export of imported functions with no unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific functions and defines __all__ for module exports. It does not execute any code, handle untrusted input, or perform network operations. No signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity are present. The functions imported relate to data operations with S3 and XComs, common in Airflow workflows. No anomalies or indicators of sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module re-export without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It serves as a clear interface for other parts of the project to access utility functions. No security concerns are identified based on this snippet.",
