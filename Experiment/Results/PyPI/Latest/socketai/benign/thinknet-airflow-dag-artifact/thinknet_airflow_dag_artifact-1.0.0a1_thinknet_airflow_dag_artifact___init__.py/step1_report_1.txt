{
  "purpose": "The code imports utility functions for reading from S3 as a DataFrame, writing DataFrames to S3, and writing XCom data to a file, likely for use in an Airflow DAG context.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing functions from 'thinknet_airflow_dag_artifact.spark_utilities' and 'thinknet_airflow_dag_artifact.xcom_utilities'.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data outputs are visible; only function imports and an explicit __all__ listing.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow is demonstrated in this snippet; it only imports functions and defines exported symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns are present. The code appears to be straightforward module import and export setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from internal utility modules, likely used elsewhere in the project. There are no dynamic code executions, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The functions themselves are not shown, so their internal behavior cannot be assessed here. The structure is typical for a Python module that consolidates exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign. It only imports functions and defines module exports without any suspicious activity or malicious intent. No security risks are evident in this fragment.",
