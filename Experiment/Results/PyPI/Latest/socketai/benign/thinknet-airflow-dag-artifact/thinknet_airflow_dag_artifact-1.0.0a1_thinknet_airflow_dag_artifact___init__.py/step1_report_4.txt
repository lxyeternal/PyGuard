{
  "purpose": "The code imports utility functions for reading from and writing to S3 storage, as well as writing XCom data to a file, likely for use in a data pipeline or workflow automation.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing functions from external modules: thinknet_airflow_dag_artifact.spark_utilities and thinknet_airflow_dag_artifact.xcom_utilities.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code only imports functions and defines an __all__ list, with no execution or data handling logic.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only contains import statements and an export list without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code consists solely of imports and a list of exported functions, with no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three utility functions related to data processing and workflow management, which are common in data pipeline modules. The functions are imported from a package likely used for orchestrating or managing data workflows, especially involving AWS S3 storage and XComs in Airflow. The __all__ list indicates the public API of this module. There are no embedded or hidden code segments, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated or malicious code, and no suspicious activity apparent from these lines.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module import and export list for utility functions related to S3 data handling and XCom management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within these lines. It appears to be part of a larger, legitimate data processing framework.",
