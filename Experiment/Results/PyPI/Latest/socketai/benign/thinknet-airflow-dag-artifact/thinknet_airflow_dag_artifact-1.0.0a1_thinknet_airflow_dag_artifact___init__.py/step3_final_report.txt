  "purpose": "Module re-export of utility functions related to S3 data handling and Airflow XComs",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules 'thinknet_airflow_dag_artifact.spark_utilities' and 'thinknet_airflow_dag_artifact.xcom_utilities'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only imports and re-exports functions",
  "flows": "Imports from internal modules -> exports via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern, no suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports three functions from internal utility modules and defines __all__ for module exports. It contains no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The functions' internal security is unknown but their names suggest standard utilities. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns justify a malware score of 0 and a very low security risk score (~0.1). The reports correctly identify the benign nature, and their scores are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module re-export with no malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
