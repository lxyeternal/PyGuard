  "purpose": "Re-exporting utility functions for reading/writing data to S3 and handling XComs in Airflow workflows",
  "sources": "Import statements from external modules 'thinknet_airflow_dag_artifact.spark_utilities' and 'thinknet_airflow_dag_artifact.xcom_utilities'",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling within this code snippet",
  "flows": "Imports bring functions into scope; re-export via __all__ for external use; no data flow or processing occurs here",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated constructs, or unusual behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing specific functions from utility modules and exposing them for external use. No data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution occurs. The structure suggests standard module re-exports for convenience. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple re-export module with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard organizational pattern in Python projects for managing utility functions.",
