  "purpose": "Re-export functions related to Spark utilities and XCom utilities for use in an Airflow DAG context.",
  "sources": "Imports from thinknet_airflow_dag_artifact modules: read_from_s3_as_dataframe, write_dataframe_to_s3, write_xcom_to_file.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; only function imports and module exports.",
  "flows": "Imported functions are made available for external modules; no data flow, input/output processing, or untrusted data handling within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code; straightforward import/export structure without hidden or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports three functions from internal modules and defines an __all__ list for export. There are no data manipulations, no execution, and no embedded logic. It acts as a module interface, not performing any data processing itself. No security issues, no hardcoded credentials, and no malicious activities are evident. The imported functions' security depends on their implementations, but they are not shown here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module re-export, with no malicious behavior or security risks present. It is a standard practice to organize imports and exports in Python modules.",
