  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a static error code and message mapping.\n- No dynamic data handling, user input processing, or external system interactions are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The code only imports exception classes and defines class attributes for error codes, exception types, and messages.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with the analysis.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is purely declarative, serving as a structured error code repository.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no code injection, no suspicious logic.\n- The import of 'ClientError' from 'botocore.exceptions' is standard for AWS SDK error handling.\n- The custom exception 'BaseErrorData' appears to be a standard base class for error data.\n\n**Assessment of risk and malware scores:**\n- Given the static nature and lack of any malicious behavior, scores of 0 for malware and security risk are appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n- The confidence score is 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports' assessments are accurate.\n- No modifications to scores or interpretations are necessary.\n- The code is a standard, safe error handling schema with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely static, non-executable error mapping without any malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.",
