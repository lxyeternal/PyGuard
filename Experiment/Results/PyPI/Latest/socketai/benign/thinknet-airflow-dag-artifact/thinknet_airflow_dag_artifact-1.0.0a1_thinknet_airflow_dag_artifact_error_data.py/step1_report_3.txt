  "purpose": "Define error codes and messages related to S3 operations, file handling, and exceptions for a specific application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'botocore.exceptions' and 'thinknet_application_specific_exception'. Definition of class attributes for error codes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows or untrusted data handling within this code segment.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present; primarily static definitions of error information.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code appears to be straightforward error code definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exception classes from external libraries and defines a subclass of a base error data class. It assigns error codes, exception types, and messages, presumably for error handling within an application. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic is present. No indications of malicious behavior or sabotage are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment appears to be a standard and safe definition of application-specific error codes. It does not contain malware, malicious intent, or security risks. It serves as a structured way to handle exceptions related to S3 and file operations.",
