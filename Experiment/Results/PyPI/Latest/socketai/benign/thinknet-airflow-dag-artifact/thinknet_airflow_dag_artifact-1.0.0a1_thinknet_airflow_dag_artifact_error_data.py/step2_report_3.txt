  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports consistently state that the code is a static error code and message mapping, with no dynamic execution, data handling, or external data processing.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are detected.\n   - The code only imports exception classes and defines class attributes with tuples containing error codes, exception types, and messages.\n\n2. **Code Content and Logic:**\n   - The code is straightforward, serving as a repository for error definitions.\n   - No functions, data flows, or logic that could be exploited.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n   - **Security Risk / Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n   - The only minor note is a typo in the message for `ADAF02`: \"occured\" should be \"occurred.\" However, this is a trivial textual error and not a security concern.\n   - The error code definitions are static and do not process untrusted data, which is appropriate for such a module.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a standard, static error mapping class.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or security issues are present.\n   - The assigned scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The typo in the message for `ADAF02` should be corrected for professionalism, but it doesn't impact security.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a benign, standard error definitions module with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the code poses no threat.",
