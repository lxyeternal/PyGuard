  "purpose": "Define error codes and messages for exception handling in an application interacting with S3 and other systems.",
  "sources": "Import statements for exceptions; class attribute assignments defining error codes, exception types, and messages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external system communication present; mainly static data definitions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static error code definitions without dynamic data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. The code is straightforward and appears to be for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'ErrorData' inheriting from 'BaseErrorData', assigning tuples that include error codes, exception types, and messages. It imports 'ClientError' from 'botocore.exceptions' and a custom exception. All entries are static mappings for error handling related to file and S3 operations. No code injection, malicious logic, or suspicious activity is evident. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The structure and content are typical for exception handling schemas.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a structured error code repository for exception handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard, non-malicious error mapping setup.",
