  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports confirm that the code is purely static, defining error codes, exception types, and messages.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, or external data handling is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code relies on external exception classes, which are standard for error handling.\n\n**Malware and obfuscation scores:**\n- All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which aligns with the analysis. The code is straightforward and non-malicious.\n\n**Security risk scores:**\n- All reports assign securityRisk = 0, which seems appropriate given the static nature of the code and absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Error and flaw assessment:**\n- No logical flaws or errors are evident.\n- The error codes and messages seem consistent and well-structured.\n- The import statements and class attribute definitions are standard.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- The scores are consistent across reports and justified by the analysis.\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected, the scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk are appropriate.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- The code does not contain any assumptions or claims that could be challenged.\n- The purpose is purely to define error handling constants, which is a common and safe pattern.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Final note:**\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the existing scores. No adjustments are necessary. The code is a standard, benign error handling schema with no security concerns.",
