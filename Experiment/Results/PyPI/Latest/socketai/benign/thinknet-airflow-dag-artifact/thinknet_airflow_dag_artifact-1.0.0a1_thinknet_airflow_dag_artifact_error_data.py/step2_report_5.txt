  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a static error code and message definition module, importing exception classes and defining class attributes with error info.\n- No dynamic logic, data processing, or external input handling is present.\n- The code is straightforward and serves as a structured error repository.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning**\n\n- The reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, static, and standard.\n- No discrepancies or overlooked issues are apparent.\n- The reports do not overstate or understate the security implications.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security risk: 0\n\n- These scores seem reasonable given the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- The risk score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- No reason to elevate the risk score, as there are no vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or security flaws.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate malware score**\n\n- All reports correctly assign malware = 0.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports assume no vulnerabilities are present; this is consistent with the static nature.\n- No assumptions are made that could be challenged; the code appears safe.\n\n**Step 7: Consistency of scores with the report**\n\n- The scores are consistent and appropriate for the described code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- The code is purely a static error code and message mapping.\n- No dynamic or executable logic, no external data handling, no secrets.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, well-structured, and typical for error handling schemas. No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
