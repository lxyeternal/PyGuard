  "purpose": "Defines a static class for error codes, exception types, and messages related to S3 and data handling errors.",
  "sources": "Import of exception classes from external modules; class attribute definitions containing error code tuples.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; static error definitions with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A - static definitions only; no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in message for ADAF02 ('occured' instead of 'occurred'), but no security relevance.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static class defining error codes and messages for exception handling. It imports standard exception classes and assigns descriptive messages. No dynamic code, data processing, or external data handling is present. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately set to 0, with high confidence (1) in this assessment. The code serves as a benign error handling schema, with no potential for malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static error code repository with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are accurate and consistent with its nature. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
