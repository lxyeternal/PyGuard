  "purpose": "Define specific error codes and messages for handling exceptions related to S3 operations, file handling, and data processing in an application.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments defining error codes and messages; imported exceptions from external libraries.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks where untrusted data is processed or sent; the code primarily defines static data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only declares error constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. The code appears to be a straightforward error code mapping.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific exceptions and defines a class with class variables representing error codes, exception types, and messages. The design is standard for error handling and does not contain dynamic code execution, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. It does not process or handle external input directly. No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a standard error code and message mapping for exception handling in an application. It appears benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
