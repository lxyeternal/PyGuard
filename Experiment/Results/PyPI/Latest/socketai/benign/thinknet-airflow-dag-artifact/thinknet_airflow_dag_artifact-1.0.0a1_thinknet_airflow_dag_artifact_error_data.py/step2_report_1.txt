  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**1. Code Validation and Issue Presence**  \n- The code is a straightforward static class defining error codes, exception types, and messages.  \n- No dynamic logic, data processing, or external input handling is present.  \n- No signs of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.  \n- The code appears to serve as a centralized error handling schema, which is a common pattern.\n\n**2. Logical Flaws or Mistakes**  \n- No logical errors are evident.  \n- The error codes are unique and follow a consistent pattern.  \n- Exception types correspond appropriately to the error messages.  \n- No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns, are detected.\n\n**3. Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.  \n- Security risk scores are also 0 across the board, aligning with the absence of dynamic or sensitive operations.  \n- The confidence scores are 1, reflecting high certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk and Malware Scores**  \n- Since the code is purely static and only defines error mappings, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.  \n- Malware score is 0, as no malicious behavior or payloads are present.  \n- Obfuscated score is 0, given the code's clarity and straightforwardness.\n\n**5. Assumptions and Potential Vulnerabilities**  \n- The reports correctly identify that the code is for error handling and contains no malicious logic.  \n- No assumptions about external data or inputs are made, reducing attack surface concerns.\n\n**6. Consistency of Scores**  \n- The assigned scores are consistent with the code's nature.  \n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**7. Overall Estimation**  \nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, well-structured, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**  \n- Maintain the current scoring.  \n- Document that this code is a static error code repository with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis.",
