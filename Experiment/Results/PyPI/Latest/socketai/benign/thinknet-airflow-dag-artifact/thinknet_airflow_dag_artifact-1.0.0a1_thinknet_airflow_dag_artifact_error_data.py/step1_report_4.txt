{
  "purpose": "Define a set of error codes and messages related to file and S3 operations within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external modules (botocore.exceptions, thinknet_application_specific_exception) and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present; the code only defines constants and imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; the code does not process or handle user input or external data dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The class solely maps error codes to messages without executing harmful actions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exception classes and defines a class with class attributes representing error codes, exception types, and messages. There is no dynamic execution, data handling, or security-sensitive operations. The structure appears to be a straightforward error mapping setup. No indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code does not include any code injection, data leakage, or harmful side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard error code definition module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply maps error codes to messages for use elsewhere in the application.",
