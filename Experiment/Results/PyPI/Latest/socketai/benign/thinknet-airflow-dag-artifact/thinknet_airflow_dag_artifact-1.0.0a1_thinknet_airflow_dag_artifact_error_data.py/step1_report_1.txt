  "purpose": "Define specific error codes and messages for handling exceptions related to file operations, S3 interactions, and other errors within an application.",
  "sources": "Import statements for exceptions from external libraries, class attribute definitions for error codes and messages.",
  "sinks": "None of the code involves untrusted data inputs or outputs; it primarily defines constants and exception mappings.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code does not execute any data flow logic or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and mainly defines static error info.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exceptions from 'botocore' and a custom exception class. It defines a class 'ErrorData' inheriting from 'BaseErrorData', with class attributes representing various error codes, exception types, and messages. There are no functions, data processing, or logic that could be exploited. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior present. The structure is typical for error handling schemas. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a structured error code repository for exception handling and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard error definitions module.",
