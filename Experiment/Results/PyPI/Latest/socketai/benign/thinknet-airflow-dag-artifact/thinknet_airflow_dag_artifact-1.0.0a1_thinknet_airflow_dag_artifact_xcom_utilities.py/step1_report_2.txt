  "purpose": "Write a Python object as JSON to a specified file path after validation, with error handling.",
  "sources": "airflow_xcom_path (function parameter), value (function parameter)",
  "sinks": "open() function for writing to file, json.dump() to serialize data into file",
  "flows": "airflow_xcom_path -> open() -> json.dump()",
  "anomalies": "Use of validate_and_strip_str_variable on file path; standard error handling; no suspicious code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code validates the file path string to prevent injection or malformed paths. It then attempts to write a JSON-serializable value to the file specified by airflow_xcom_path, catching specific exceptions (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, TypeError) and raising custom errors accordingly. The code appears to handle errors securely and does not contain suspicious or malicious behavior. The validation and exception handling follow best practices, and there are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code securely writes data to a file with proper validation and error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The code appears safe and legitimate.",
