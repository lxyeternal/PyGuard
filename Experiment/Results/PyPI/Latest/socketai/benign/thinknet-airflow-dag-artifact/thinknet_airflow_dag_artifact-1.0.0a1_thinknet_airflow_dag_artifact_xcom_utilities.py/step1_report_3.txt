  "purpose": "The function writes a given value to a specified file path, used for storing data in an Airflow XCom context.",
  "sources": "Reads the variable 'airflow_xcom_path' (validated as a string) and 'value' (any type).",
  "sinks": "Opens a file at 'airflow_xcom_path' and writes JSON data; potential file write or overwrite.",
  "flows": "Input 'airflow_xcom_path' and 'value' -> validate path -> open file -> dump JSON data to file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious external calls or data exfiltration routines. Usage of validation functions before file operations is standard. Error handling relies on custom exceptions but does not introduce malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code validates the file path string before attempting to write. It opens the specified file for writing with UTF-8 encoding and dumps the 'value' as JSON. Error handling catches common file operation exceptions and raises custom errors. There is no evidence of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Usage of external modules seems to be for validation and error handling. No suspicious code flow, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform a safe file write operation with proper validation and error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks within this fragment.",
