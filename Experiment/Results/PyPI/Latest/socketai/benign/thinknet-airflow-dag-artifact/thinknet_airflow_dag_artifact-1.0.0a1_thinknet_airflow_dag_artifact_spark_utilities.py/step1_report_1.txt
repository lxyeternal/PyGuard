  "purpose": "Read and write DataFrames from/to S3 storage with validation and error handling.",
  "sources": "path_file variable input; DataFrame input in write function.",
  "sinks": "Reading from or writing to specified S3 paths; raises errors based on exception handling.",
  "flows": "Input validation of path_file, reading/parquet data from S3, writing DataFrame to S3, error handling based on exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. Use of exception handling for specific error strings is normal but should be monitored.",
  "analysis": "The code performs validation on input variables, handles exceptions from Spark read/write operations, and raises structured errors. No malicious behavior or backdoors are evident. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic found. The validation functions and exception handling appear standard and do not indicate sabotage or malicious intent. The print statement for logging is benign. No signs of malware or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data access and storage utility with standard error handling. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent. The main concern is ensuring proper validation functions are secure, but they are not part of this code snippet.",
