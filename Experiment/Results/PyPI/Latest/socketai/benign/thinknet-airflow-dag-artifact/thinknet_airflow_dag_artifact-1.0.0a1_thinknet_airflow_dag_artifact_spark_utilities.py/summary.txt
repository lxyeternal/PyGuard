  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility for Spark-based S3 data access, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, though reliance on exception message strings warrants minimal caution. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose security concerns."
