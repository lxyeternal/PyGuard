{
  "purpose": "The code reads data from and writes data to S3 storage using PySpark DataFrame operations, with validation and error handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'path_file' for file paths, 'df' for DataFrame input.",
  "sinks": "File system (S3 storage) via spark.read.parquet and df.write.parquet; error raising functions.",
  "flows": "Input 'path_file' is validated, then used to read/write data; exceptions are caught and trigger error raises.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code. Use of print statement for logging might be considered poor practice but not malicious. No suspicious dynamic execution, no data exfiltration, or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical file read/write operations with validation and error handling. It uses Spark's APIs to access S3 storage. Error handling captures specific exceptions and raises custom errors. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No hardcoded credentials or secret data observed. Use of validation functions is standard, and error handling is straightforward. No suspicious flows or data leaks detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured data processing module with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It performs expected operations safely and with proper error handling.",
