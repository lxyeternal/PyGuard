  "purpose": "Static analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, external network calls, environment variables, data handling functions.",
  "sinks": "Network communication points, file operations, environment variable access, data output functions.",
  "flows": "Sources feeding into data processing, which then may lead to network or file sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, placeholder scripts, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate either absence of code or benign static characteristics. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are present. Confidence levels vary based on code completeness, but overall, the static analysis suggests minimal threat. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with benign assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is either absent or benign with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The static analysis supports a very low threat level, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
