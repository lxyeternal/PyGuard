  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a legitimate, flexible runtime patch management utility capable of dynamic function replacement and dummy module creation. It does not contain malicious code or payloads but possesses powerful features that could be exploited if misused. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is absent, and the security risk is low (~0.2). The existing reports' scores are consistent with this assessment, accurately reflecting the benign nature with potential misuse risks."
