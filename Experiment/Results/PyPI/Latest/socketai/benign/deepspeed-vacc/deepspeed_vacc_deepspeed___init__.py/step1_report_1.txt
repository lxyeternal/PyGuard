{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python package module, possibly providing some functionality to users. No explicit purpose is indicated beyond typical library functions.",
  "sources": "Code reads environment variables, imports standard libraries, and loads data from variables or inputs if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, subprocess calls, or data storage points. No explicit network activity or data exfiltration is observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or inputs into functions, but there are no evident paths leading from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected. No hidden backdoors or malicious code segments identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily uses standard Python libraries and performs typical operations such as data processing, possibly reading environment variables, and executing functions. There is no use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated strings, or external network connections. All operations appear benign and consistent with normal package behavior. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration activities is present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, non-malicious library module with no indicators of compromise or sabotage.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
