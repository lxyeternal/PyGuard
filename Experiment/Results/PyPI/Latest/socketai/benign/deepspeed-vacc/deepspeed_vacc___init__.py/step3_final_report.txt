  "purpose": "Analyze Python package code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns, obfuscation, dynamic execution, and data leaks.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, network calls, dynamic code execution points, hardcoded strings, obfuscated variables.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system modifications, environment variable access, eval/exec execution points, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input data or environment variables -> processing functions -> eval/exec or network calls -> potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of eval/exec with unsanitized data, suspicious network activity, hardcoded strings, inconsistent or unnecessary dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns of obfuscation and dynamic execution, with suspicious network calls and hardcoded strings indicating malicious intent. Sources include environment variables and input functions; sinks involve network and eval/exec points. Flows from input or environment to eval/exec or network suggest potential data exfiltration or malicious control. Anomalies such as obfuscation and use of eval/exec without sanitization are present. The overall suspicion is high, with code likely designed to conceal malicious behavior and perform unauthorized actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high likelihood of malicious intent, characterized by obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and suspicious network activity. It warrants a malware score of 0.75, a security risk of 0.75, and an obfuscation score of 0.65, reflecting significant security concerns. Benign reports correctly show low scores. The suspicious reports justify elevated scores, indicating a serious threat that should be addressed promptly.",
