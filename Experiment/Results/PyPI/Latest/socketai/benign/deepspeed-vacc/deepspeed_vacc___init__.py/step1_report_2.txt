{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple Python script performing basic data processing or utility functions. There is no clear indication of malicious intent based solely on the provided content.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, user input functions, and external modules. It may also import data from external files or URLs if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, subprocess or system calls, or data transmission points that could leak information or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (user input, environment variables, external data) through processing functions, and then potentially to sinks such as network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious function calls are evident. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or dynamic execution patterns are observed. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code has a standard structure with typical input/output handling. It imports standard libraries and executes functions in a logical sequence. There are no signs of code injection, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior. Since no external or suspicious network calls, credential handling, or obfuscated parts are identified, the code seems benign. Without specific malicious code or data leaks, the overall risk remains low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or significant security risks. The code appears to be a normal utility or data processing script with no suspicious or harmful features.",
