{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to process flow data for traffic or network nodes, generate normalized node features, convert adjacency matrices, and prepare datasets for temporal graph forecasting models.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from 'flow_df' DataFrame, including 'timestamp', 'num_people', and 'PAR_id' columns, and uses 'ADJACENCY_MAT' for graph structure. It also uses 'torch', 'numpy', and 'torch_geometric' libraries.",
  "sinks": "Transforms adjacency matrix to sparse format; generates features and targets for time series forecasting. No explicit untrusted data sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (flow_df, ADJACENCY_MAT) -> Processed into normalized tensor X and graph edges -> Features and targets generated -> Dataset created for forecasting.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data handling detected. Use of standard libraries and functions with clear purpose. No obfuscated or misleading code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical data normalization, adjacency matrix conversion, and dataset preparation for graph temporal models. It leverages well-known libraries and follows standard practices. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or unauthorized data exfiltration. The methods use the input data straightforwardly, with no external or hidden data transmissions or harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for graph-based temporal data processing and forecasting. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware signals are identified. The code structure and data handling are consistent with intended functionality.",
