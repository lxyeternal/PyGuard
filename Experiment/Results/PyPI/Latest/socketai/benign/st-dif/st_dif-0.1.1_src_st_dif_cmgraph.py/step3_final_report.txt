  "purpose": "The code processes traffic flow data to generate normalized node features, converts adjacency matrices to sparse formats, and prepares datasets for temporal graph neural network forecasting.",
  "sources": "Reads from pandas DataFrame 'flow_df' and adjacency matrix 'ADJACENCY_MAT'.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no external data transmission or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'flow_df' and 'ADJACENCY_MAT' through normalization and conversion functions into dataset objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Minor potential issue: division by zero if stds are zero, but not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data normalization, adjacency conversion, and dataset creation for graph-based temporal prediction. It uses common libraries and methods without obfuscation or external communication. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The normalization is typical, and the adjacency conversion is straightforward. The only minor concern is potential division by zero during normalization, but this does not constitute a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data preprocessing module for graph neural network training, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. It is well-structured, transparent, and uses conventional methods. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0.",
