{
  "purpose": "Defines an __all__ list for module exports and imports utility functions related to training, evaluation, and checkpoint management.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from a local module '.train_test_utils'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Imported functions are made available for use elsewhere; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. The code appears standard for module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a relative module, likely for use elsewhere in the package. It defines the exported symbols for the module. There is no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. No inputs are processed, and no sensitive data handling is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward module setup with no signs of malicious intent. It simply organizes and exports utility functions for training, evaluation, and checkpoint management. No security risks identified.",
