{
  "purpose": "This code exports functions related to training, evaluating, saving, and loading model checkpoints, likely part of a machine learning pipeline.",
  "sources": "Imports from a local module '.train_test_utils' which presumably contains the implementation of the functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code only imports and exports functions without executing untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Data flow from the imported module functions (train, evaluate, save_or_update_checkpoint, load_checkpoint) to any external process that uses these exports; no untrusted data flows observed in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports four functions from a local utility module and makes them available for external use via the __all__ list. It is typical for modular Python projects. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The code is minimal and standard, with no indication of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module export with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a machine learning utility package with standard imports and exports.",
