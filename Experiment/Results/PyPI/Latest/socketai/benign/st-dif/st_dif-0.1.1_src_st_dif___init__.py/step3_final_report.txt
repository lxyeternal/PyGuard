  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports specific utility functions from a local module '.train_test_utils' and exposes them for external use via the __all__ list.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports functions from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions from '.train_test_utils' and makes them available externally; no data flows or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import and export pattern with no data handling, network activity, or dynamic execution. It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with confidence 1. The code's simplicity and standard structure justify these scores. No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made, and the code aligns with typical Python module practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export pattern with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
