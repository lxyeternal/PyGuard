  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code simply imports four functions from a local module `.train_test_utils` and exposes them via the `__all__` list.\n   - There are no additional operations, no user input handling, no network communication, or data processing within this snippet.\n   - The code appears to be a standard module export pattern, typical in Python projects for organizing utility functions.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n   - The code is straightforward and aligns with common practices.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All five reports consistently describe the code as a benign, standard module export pattern.\n   - Each report assigns a confidence level of 1, with all scores for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk at 0.\n   - The reasoning in all reports is sound and consistent with the code content.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - The overall assessment that the code is safe and typical for a Python module is justified.\n\n5. **Potential Risks or Assumptions:**\n   - Since the code only imports functions from a local module, the security implications depend on the contents of `.train_test_utils`. However, based solely on this snippet, no issues are present.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are justified here; the code is standard.\n\n6. **Final Recommendations:**\n   - Based on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assessments.\n   - No changes to the scores are necessary.\n   - The code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n7. **My Own Estimation:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0\n   - **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, straightforward module for exporting utility functions. The reports are accurate, and no security concerns are evident from this snippet. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is needed.",
