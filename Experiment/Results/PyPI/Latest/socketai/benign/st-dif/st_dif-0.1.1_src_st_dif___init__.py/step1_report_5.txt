{
  "purpose": "Defines an __all__ list for module exports and imports several utility functions related to training, evaluation, checkpoint saving/updating, and loading from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '.train_test_utils'",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs with untrusted data or external effects present",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports functions and declares exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local module and explicitly exports them via __all__. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs such as network calls, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors. The code structure is straightforward, typical for Python modules defining exports. No signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export pattern importing utility functions and defining __all__. No malicious intent, no security risks detected.",
