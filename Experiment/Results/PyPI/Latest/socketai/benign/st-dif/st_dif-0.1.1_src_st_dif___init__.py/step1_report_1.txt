{
  "purpose": "Export training, evaluation, checkpoint saving/updating, and loading functions for a machine learning workflow",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '.train_test_utils'",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports and exports functions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from a local module, likely part of a larger project. It exports these functions via __all__ for external use. No user input handling, no network communication, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code appears straightforward, structured, and follows common Python practices for module exports. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export pattern with no malicious or security concerns identified. It simply re-exports functions from a local utility module.",
