{
  "purpose": "This code module exports utility functions related to training, evaluation, and checkpoint management for a machine learning model.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from a relative module '.train_test_utils'. No external data sources or inputs are directly read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could leak data.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows; the code only exports functions and imports from another module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures are present. The code appears straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local module, then exposes those functions via __all__ for external use. No data manipulation, input/output handling, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code is minimal, standard, and contains no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module export pattern for utility functions, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and typical for a Python project structure.",
