{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load, process, and split datasets for temporal graph forecasting tasks, particularly using PyTorch and custom graph structures.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files (via get_configs_dict), CSV data files (pd.read_csv), environment variables (os.getcwd()), and user input via function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Data is converted into tensors and fed into DataLoader objects for training/validation/testing. No direct data leak points are evident; the code outputs mostly for debugging.",
  "flows": "Config files -> get_configs_dict -> CSV files -> dataset creation -> conversion to tensors -> dataset splitting -> DataLoader creation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated language observed. The config parsing handles array strings but appears standard. No suspicious network activity or system modification code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dataset loading, processing, and splitting for ML workflows. It reads configuration files and CSV data, converts features to tensors, and creates DataLoader objects for training, validation, and testing. The config parsing converts comma-separated string values into NumPy arrays, which is standard. There is no evidence of malicious intent such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of print statements is typical for debugging. No external network or system commands are invoked. The code relies on external libraries for ML tasks and does not manipulate environment variables or sensitive system files beyond reading configs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard dataset processing module for graph forecasting models. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The security risk is minimal, assuming external dependencies are trusted and configuration files are secure.",
