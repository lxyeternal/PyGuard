{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load configuration files, prepare datasets, and generate data loaders for temporal graph forecasting tasks using PyTorch and related libraries.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration files (via get_configs_dict), CSV files for flow data (pd.read_csv), and retrieves data from the CMGraph class.",
  "sinks": "The code passes data to PyTorch DataLoader, which could be exploited if data sources are malicious, but no unsafe execution or network activity is directly present.",
  "flows": "Data is read from CSV and configuration files, then processed into tensors and split into datasets and loaders.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code uses standard libraries and conventional data processing methods.",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration files and CSV data, processes them into numpy arrays and tensors, and then splits datasets for training, validation, and testing. There are no suspicious data flows, unsafe data handling, or hidden behaviors. No code injection, network activity, or system modifications are observed. Usage of external libraries (pandas, numpy, torch) is standard, and no obfuscated code or dynamic execution appears. The code includes proper validation for ratio sums and file reading, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for dataset preparation in machine learning workflows with no malicious behavior detected. It processes data securely and uses typical data handling patterns.",
