{
  "purpose": "The code exports specific classes from local modules for use in a larger package, facilitating organized access to components.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.sten and .temporal_only) that define and provide classes.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code only imports and exports class names without handling external data or untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only establishes package exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behavior detected. The use of relative imports is typical in package structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes DenseGCNGRU, GCNGRU, and GRU_only from local modules and makes them available at the package level via __all__. It serves as an index or facade for class exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The code structure is straightforward and standard for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module export pattern used in Python packages. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply re-exports classes for easier package access.",
