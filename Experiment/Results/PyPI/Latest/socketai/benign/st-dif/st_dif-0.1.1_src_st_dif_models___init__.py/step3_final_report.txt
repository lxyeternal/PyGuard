{
  "purpose": "This code re-exports specific classes from internal modules to define the public API of the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports classes from local modules (.sten and .temporal_only).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to static imports from local modules; no data flows from source to sink beyond import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple relative imports of classes from internal modules and defines __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no data processing, network communication, or dynamic behaviors. The code is typical for a package's __init__.py or similar module to organize exports. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving solely as a package export module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and assessments in the reports are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
