{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to expose specific classes from local module files to be available at the package level, facilitating their import in other parts of the project.",
  "sources": "The code reads the modules '.sten' and '.temporal_only' to import classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import classes from internal modules and define what is publicly accessible via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code only performs standard imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple import statements to include specific classes from local modules, and an __all__ list to specify the public API. There is no data processing, user input handling, network communication, or any other potentially malicious behavior. The code is clean, minimal, and typical of a package's __init__.py or similar setup files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard package initialization code to organize module exports.",
