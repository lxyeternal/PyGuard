  "purpose": "Extend the Odoo product.template model with a new boolean field indicating commission-free status.",
  "sources": "Import of 'fields' and 'models' from the Odoo framework, and access to the 'product.template' model.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply adds a new field to an existing model.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs. The license declaration is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules from Odoo, defines a model extension class inheriting from 'product.template', and adds a boolean field with default False. No user input handling, no external data, and no dynamic execution are present. The license declaration is standard for open-source projects and not suspicious. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code securely extends the Odoo product template with an additional boolean field. There are no malicious activities, suspicious behaviors, or security risks identified.",
