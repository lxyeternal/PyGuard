  "purpose": "Extend the Odoo product.template model by adding a boolean field for commission-free status.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines a data model with a default value.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause harm.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present, as the code only declares a model extension with a static default value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward model extension with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary Odoo modules and defines a new Boolean field 'commission_free' on the product.template model with a default value of False. It does not include any input handling, external data processing, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code patterns are present. The purpose appears to be adding a simple feature flag related to commission status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension of an Odoo model intended to add a feature flag. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
