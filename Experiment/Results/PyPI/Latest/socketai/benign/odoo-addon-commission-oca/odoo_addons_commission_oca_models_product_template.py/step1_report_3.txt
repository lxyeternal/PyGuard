{
  "purpose": "Extend the Odoo product.template model by adding a boolean field 'commission_free' to indicate if the product is free of commission.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; only defines a model extension with a default boolean value.",
  "sinks": "No potential sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows; the code is purely declarative for model extension.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules from Odoo, inherits an existing model, and adds a simple boolean field with a default value. There is no data processing, user input handling, external communication, or any dynamic code execution. The code appears standard for an Odoo module extension with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward extension of an Odoo model, adding a boolean field without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It presents no security risks or malicious intent.",
