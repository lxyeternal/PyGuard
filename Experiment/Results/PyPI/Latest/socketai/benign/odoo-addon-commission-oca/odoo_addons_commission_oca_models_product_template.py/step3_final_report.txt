  "purpose": "Extend the Odoo 'product.template' model by adding a boolean field 'commission_free' with default False.",
  "sources": "Import of 'fields' and 'models' from Odoo; class definition inheriting from 'product.template'; declaration of 'commission_free' field.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only defines a model extension with a static boolean field.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process data flows or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; straightforward model extension.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, inherits from an existing model, and adds a boolean field without any external data handling, dynamic execution, or malicious constructs. It is a simple, benign extension of an Odoo model, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent and appropriate given the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward extension of an Odoo model, adding a feature flag without any malicious or security concerns. The security risk and malware scores are correctly set to 0, and the code poses no threat. The reports' assessments are accurate and align with the code's simplicity.",
