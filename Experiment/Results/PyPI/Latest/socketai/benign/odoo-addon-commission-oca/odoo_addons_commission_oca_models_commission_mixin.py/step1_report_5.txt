{
  "purpose": "The code defines abstract models and mixins for managing commissions and commission agents in an Odoo module, facilitating commission calculations and agent management.",
  "sources": "User input through model fields; method calls triggering computations.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no untrusted data outputs or external calls observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input fields (agent_ids, product_id, etc.) into computation methods (_compute_amount, _compute_commission_id, etc.), with no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The only notable point is the presence of unimplemented methods (_compute_agent_ids, _compute_amount) intended for extension, which is typical for abstract models.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of Odoo ORM models with standard field definitions, dependencies, and utility methods for handling commissions. It includes exception handling for NotImplementedError in abstract methods, ensuring correct implementation in subclasses. No signs of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or suspicious data handling are present. The code adheres to typical Odoo development practices, with clear separation of concerns and standard conventions. There are no indications of embedded malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Odoo module implementation for managing commissions with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, well-structured, and safe for use.",
