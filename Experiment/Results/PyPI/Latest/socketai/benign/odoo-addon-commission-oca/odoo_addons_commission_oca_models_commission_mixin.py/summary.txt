  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minimal security risk reflects its standard ORM nature and UI components. The initial high risk scores are unwarranted; a risk score of approximately 0.1-0.2 is appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0."
