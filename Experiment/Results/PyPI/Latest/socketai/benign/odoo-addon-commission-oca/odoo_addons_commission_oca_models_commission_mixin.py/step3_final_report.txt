{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract models for managing commissions and commission lines within an Odoo module, facilitating agent assignment and commission calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads data from fields such as product_id, agent_ids, and related partner and commission models.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission; internal ORM operations and UI actions for agent management.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input fields to computed fields and through methods like _prepare_agent_vals and _compute_amount; UI actions trigger views for agent editing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'raise NotImplementedError' in abstract methods is standard; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of Odoo models for commission management. It employs typical ORM patterns, computed fields, and UI actions. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious patterns are present. The abstract methods are placeholders for extension, not malicious code. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices indicate a very low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minimal security risk reflects its standard ORM nature and UI components. The initial high risk scores are unwarranted; a risk score of approximately 0.1-0.2 is appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0.",
