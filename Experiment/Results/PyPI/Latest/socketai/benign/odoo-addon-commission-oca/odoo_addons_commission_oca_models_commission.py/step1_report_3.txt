  "purpose": "Define and manage commission structures and sections in an Odoo module for sales commissions.",
  "sources": "User input through database fields (e.g., commission_type, fix_qty, section_ids, amount_from, amount_to, percent).",
  "sinks": "Calculation methods like calculate_section that process input data to compute commissions.",
  "flows": "Input data (fields) -> validate constraints -> calculation logic in calculate_section.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscated code, no malicious network activity, or suspicious data leaks identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines Odoo models for commissions and sections, with standard fields and validation. It performs simple calculations and validation checks on numerical data. No external data or network activity, no code injection, no handling of untrusted inputs beyond field validation, and no suspicious logic. The constraints and calculations appear to be straightforward and aligned with typical commission logic. The code does not include any potentially malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of commission management with no malicious intent or security risks. It uses typical Odoo ORM features and validations. No signs of malware or security issues are present.",
