{
  "purpose": "Defines Odoo models for managing commissions and their sections, including calculation and validation logic.",
  "sources": "User input fields, model definitions, and internal method calls such as fields_get and ensure_one.",
  "sinks": "Calculation functions like calculate_section, which process input data to compute commission amounts.",
  "flows": "Input data from fields flows through calculate_section to produce commission calculations; no external data flows or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external system interactions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Odoo models with straightforward validation and calculation logic. No external calls, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of fields_get is dynamic but safe. The constraint ensures data integrity. The calculation method iterates over sections to find applicable ranges and computes the commission proportionally. Overall, the code is clear, well-structured, and adheres to best practices without any signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, legitimate Odoo module for managing commissions, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
