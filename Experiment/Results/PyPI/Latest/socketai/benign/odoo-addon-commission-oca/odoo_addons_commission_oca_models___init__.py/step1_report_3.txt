  "purpose": "Import local modules related to commission, commission_mixin, commission_settlement, product_template, and res_partner",
  "sources": "Module imports from the current package (relative imports)",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only performs imports without data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports; only standard relative imports",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative import statements for modules within the same package. No untrusted data is read, no external network connections, no code execution or data leakage mechanisms are present. The simplicity and standard nature of the imports suggest normal package structure. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. No obfuscation or unusual syntax observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of standard relative import statements with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
