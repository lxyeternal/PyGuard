  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\nfrom . import commission\nfrom . import commission_mixin\nfrom . import commission_settlement\nfrom . import product_template\nfrom . import res_partner\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The code is purely import statements for internal modules, with no dynamic behavior, no code execution, or suspicious patterns. All reports agree that this is standard package setup code.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or security flaws?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and standard for Python packages. No errors or mistakes are evident.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of import statements.\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign very low risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.1). Since the code contains no executable logic, no data handling, and no suspicious activity, these scores seem reasonable.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- The **malware score of 0** is justified because there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- The **obfuscated score of 0** is justified because the code is transparent and straightforward.\n- The **risk score** is low (0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal security concern, which is appropriate.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  All reports correctly identify that these are just import statements, with no evidence of vulnerabilities.\n- **Any inconsistencies?**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the uniformity of the reports and the code's simplicity, I agree with the overall assessment: this code is benign, standard, and poses no security risk.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (since it's just import statements, very low risk)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical module import setup with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that in the broader codebase, no dynamic or runtime behaviors are introduced elsewhere that could change this assessment. But based solely on this snippet, it is safe.",
