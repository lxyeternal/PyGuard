  "purpose": "Import statements for various modules within the same package, likely for organizing code and modular functionality.",
  "sources": "Module import statements; no external data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; only internal imports are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no data flows or processing logic; only module imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard import syntax used without suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative import statements from the current package, importing modules such as commission, commission_mixin, commission_settlement, product_template, and res_partner. There are no executable statements, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or other suspicious patterns. The structure is typical for a modular Python package setup. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward set of import statements with no malicious intent or security concerns. The code appears to serve the purpose of organizing and modularizing the package components safely.",
