{
  "purpose": "The code imports multiple modules within the same package, likely for organizing functionality related to commissions, products, and partners.",
  "sources": "Import statements accessing internal modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present; this is purely import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only internal module references are made.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only import statements without any dynamic or unusual behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static import operations from internal modules, which is typical for Python package organization. There are no indications of malicious activity, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden behavior. The minimal structure suggests standard practice rather than a malicious payload.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code consists solely of import statements for internal modules, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard package initialization or module referencing code.",
