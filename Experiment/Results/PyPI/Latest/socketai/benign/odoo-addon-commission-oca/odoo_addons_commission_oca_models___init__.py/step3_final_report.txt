{
  "purpose": "The code performs static relative imports within a Python package, likely for modular organization.",
  "sources": "Import statements referencing internal modules: commission, commission_mixin, commission_settlement, product_template, res_partner.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports modules without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward import statements with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements within a package, indicating standard modular design. No dynamic code, network activity, or malicious constructs are present. The absence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns suggests benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the code's nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package import code with no security risks or malicious intent. The existing scores are appropriate and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
