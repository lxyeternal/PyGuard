  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or data output present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow, input, or output operations detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed. All imports are standard relative imports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative import statements from the same package, indicating a modular design. There are no data inputs, network calls, or executable logic. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity reduces the likelihood of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module initializer or organizer of internal components. No malicious activity, security risks, or anomalies detected.",
