{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules named 'models' and 'wizards' from the current package, likely for defining or managing application logic.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load modules from the local package directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs; the code only imports modules.",
  "flows": "Module import statements, which do not involve data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements importing modules within the same package. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or other potentially malicious actions. There is no indication of obfuscation or suspicious behavior. Without additional context or code, it is not possible to identify malicious intent from these lines alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be standard package structure code.",
