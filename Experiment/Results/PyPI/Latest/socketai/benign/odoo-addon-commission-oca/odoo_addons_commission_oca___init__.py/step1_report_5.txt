  "purpose": "The code imports modules named 'models' and 'wizards' from the current package, likely for application functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading local modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurring in these lines.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data pathways evident.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no suspicious or unusual patterns, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed solely of import statements from local modules within the same package. There are no data inputs, external network calls, or dynamic code execution. The simplicity suggests standard package structure without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No anomalies or indicators of malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of straightforward module imports with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
