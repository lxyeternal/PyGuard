{
  "purpose": "The code imports local modules 'models' and 'wizards' within the same package, serving to include functionality from these modules into the current namespace.",
  "sources": "The import statements themselves are the data sources; they read the module files 'models' and 'wizards' from the local package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the import statements simply load modules without executing code or handling external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is minimal and standard for Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative import statements for local modules, indicating a typical package structure. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing occurs. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns suggest it is benign. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assign malware scores of 0, and keep security risk scores very low or zero. No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities is present. The confidence in benignity is high, and the scores are consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import of local modules with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No further action is necessary based on this snippet.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
