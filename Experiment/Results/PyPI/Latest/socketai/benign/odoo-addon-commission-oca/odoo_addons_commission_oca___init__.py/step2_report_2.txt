  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully and systematically.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\nAll reports describe the same minimal code snippet:\n```python\nfrom . import models\nfrom . import wizards\n```\nThis code is a straightforward relative import of local modules within the same package. There are no signs of code execution, data handling, or external interactions. Based solely on this snippet, there are no issues or malicious behaviors present.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent in stating that the code is benign and standard.\n- They correctly identify that no data flows, external calls, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- They assign high confidence levels (mostly 0.9 or 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n- They also correctly note the absence of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n\nNo logical errors or flaws are evident in these assessments.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores and suggest adjustments**\n\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- Security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1, which seems slightly conservative but acceptable given the minimal context.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0 across the board, which is correct.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues exists here. Therefore, risk scores should remain very low or zero.\n- The one report giving 0.1 security risk is acceptable but could be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n\n**Step 5: Malware score considerations**\n\n- Since no malicious activity or suspicious behavior is present, malware scores should be 0.\n- The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities beyond the import statements, which are benign.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious code are made, which is appropriate.\n\n**Step 7: Consistency of scores with the report**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the content.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, based on these snippets:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (more appropriate than 0.1 or 0.2, given no evidence of risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard import statement with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. The reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and does not pose security concerns.",
