{
  "purpose": "This code imports modules named 'models' and 'wizards' from the same package, likely for application logic or UI components.",
  "sources": "Module imports from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are evident in this snippet; imports do not process data directly.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements. No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports local modules 'models' and 'wizards' without any additional logic. It does not perform data processing, network activity, or system calls. Given the simplicity, it appears to be a standard module import statement typical in Python projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as hidden backdoors, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code's context is limited, but based solely on these lines, no security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import of local modules and does not demonstrate any malicious intent or security risks. It is likely part of a larger application structure.",
