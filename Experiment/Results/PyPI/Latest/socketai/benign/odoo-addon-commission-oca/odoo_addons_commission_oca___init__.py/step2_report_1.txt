  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements of local modules ('models' and 'wizards').\n- No code execution, data processing, network activity, or dynamic behavior is involved.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are mentioned.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), indicating the reviewers are quite certain about benignity.\n- Malware scores are all 0, aligning with the assessment that there's no malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are very low or zero, consistent with the minimal nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code **does** contain only import statements of local modules. No issues are present in the code itself.\n- The logic, reasoning, and summaries are consistent with the code snippet.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; they correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- No significant flaws are apparent. They correctly interpret the code as standard package import statements.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are very low, reflecting the minimal and benign nature.\n- The reports assign high confidence, which is justified.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- Since the code is purely import statements, there's no basis for higher risk or malware scores.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made, and no evidence suggests otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a straightforward import of local modules, typical in Python projects.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very minimal, standard code structure)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and appropriately assess the security posture of this code snippet. No further action or concern is warranted based on this code alone.",
