  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious constructs, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs relative imports of 'models' and 'wizards' modules within the same package. No data handling, user input, or untrusted data sources are present. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are evident. This is typical package initialization code. There are no obfuscated elements, backdoors, or malicious behaviors apparent in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard relative imports without any signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
