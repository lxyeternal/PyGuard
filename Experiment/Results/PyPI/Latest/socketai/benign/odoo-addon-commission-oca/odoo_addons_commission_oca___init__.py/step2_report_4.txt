  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and evaluate the scores and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: simple relative imports of 'models' and 'wizards' modules within the same package.\n- No data processing, network activity, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are mentioned.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of this code snippet.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the issues in the code:\n\n**Does the code contain any issues?**  \n- **No.** The code is a straightforward import statement with no evident vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or anomalies.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n\n- **No significant errors.** All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- Slight redundancy in wording across reports, but no logical errors.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1.  \n  Since the code is purely import statements with no vulnerabilities, a score of 0 is justified. The 0.1 might be an overly cautious minor concern, but not unreasonable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- No reason exists here; the code is trivial and benign.  \n- The highest risk score should be **0**.\n\n### Consistency of scores with the reports:\n\n- All scores are consistent with the benign analysis.\n- No discrepancies or unreasonable elevations.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- **Potential for malicious intent:**  \n  The code snippet itself shows no malicious behavior or indicators of malware.\n\n- **Assumptions about the modules:**  \n  Since the modules are local, unless they contain malicious code (which is outside the scope of this snippet), there's no concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nBased on the provided reports and the code snippet:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0** (or possibly 0.1 if a very cautious approach is taken, but 0 is more justified here)\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\n\n| Score Type        | Final Justified Score | Rationale                                                                                     |\n|-------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                       | No malicious activity or indicators present.                                                 |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                       | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.                                             |\n| Security Risk     | 0                       | No vulnerabilities or risky behavior identified.                                               |\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nAll reports correctly identify this code as benign. The scores should be **0** for malware and obfuscated, and **0** for security risk, reflecting the absence of any security concerns.\n\n**Note:** Always consider the context of the larger application, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious or risky behavior.",
