  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements for local modules 'models' and 'wizards'.\n   - There are no signs of malicious behavior, data processing, or obfuscation in the code snippet.\n   - No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly note the benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The only minor point is that the reports assign a very low security risk score (mostly 0 or 0.1), which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - Malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Security risk scores are mostly 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable considering the simplicity and benign assessment.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.1, which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any risky operations, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n   - The code is purely import statements with no evidence of malware.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and avoid assumptions; they only state facts based on the code snippet.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward import of local modules, typical in Python projects.\n- There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased solely on this snippet, the code is benign. Any security concern would depend on the contents of 'models' and 'wizards' modules, but from this import statement alone, there is no risk.",
