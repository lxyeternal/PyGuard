{
  "purpose": "The code extends the 'res.partner' model in Odoo to add fields related to commissions and agents, including relationships and configuration options.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the Odoo ORM fields and models, particularly 'res.partner', 'commission', and 'commission.settlement'. No external or untrusted data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily sets up ORM fields and relationships; there are no sinks involving external data transmission, command execution, or insecure data handling.",
  "flows": "There are no direct data flows involving untrusted input; the code manipulates ORM models and fields, which are internal to the application.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code structure is standard for Odoo modules.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class extending 'res.partner' to add new fields such as 'agent_ids', 'agent', 'agent_type', 'commission_id', 'settlement', and 'settlement_ids'. It includes a method '_commercial_fields' that appends 'agent_ids' to the list of commercial fields. All code adheres to standard Odoo practices for model extension. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or security flaws. The license comments indicate open-source licensing, with no malicious intent evident. No external data sources, sinks, or flows that could lead to security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Odoo model extension for managing partner-related commission and agent data. It contains no malicious behavior, security issues, or anomalies. It is safe and typical of an Odoo module for business logic extension.",
