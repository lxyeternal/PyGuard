{
  "purpose": "Extend the 'res.partner' model in Odoo to add fields related to commissions and agents, facilitating partner management and commission configurations.",
  "sources": "Data read from fields, model inheritance, default values for fields",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network operations, file writes, or eval execution",
  "flows": "N/A - The code primarily defines fields and a method without data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code adheres to typical Odoo module patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Odoo model extension adding fields for agent management, including many2many, boolean, selection, and one2many fields. The default values and domain constraints are typical. No data is read from or written to external sources or untrusted inputs. The method _commercial_fields() extends the parent method to include 'agent_ids' in a list, which is standard practice for field synchronization. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward model extension for managing partner agents and commissions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
