{
  "purpose": "Extend the res.partner model in Odoo to add fields related to agents and commissions.",
  "sources": "User input or external data affecting 'agent_ids', 'agent', 'agent_type', 'commission_id', 'settlement', and 'settlement_ids'.",
  "sinks": "Database operations involving model fields such as 'agent_ids', 'commission_id', and 'settlement_ids'.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the model's fields; no direct flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code primarily defines data models and fields with no suspicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code extends an Odoo model by adding various fields related to partner agents and their commission settings. It uses standard Odoo ORM field definitions, such as Many2many, Boolean, Selection, and One2many. The domain filters for 'agent_ids' to only include partners marked as agents ('agent' = True), which is typical. The method '_commercial_fields' appends 'agent_ids' to a list, likely for synchronization, following standard inheritance patterns. There are no dynamic code executions, external system calls, or suspicious behaviors. No data leaks, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured model extension with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard extension of an Odoo model to manage agent-related fields for partners. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. It is a typical, safe implementation intended for business logic enhancement.",
