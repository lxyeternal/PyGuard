  "purpose": "Extend the res.partner model in Odoo to include fields related to agents and commissions for partner management.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines model fields and default values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external output; no network communication or data leakage points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only manipulates model fields and defines domain logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors; the code appears to be standard Odoo model extension.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Odoo modules and defines a model extension with fields for agent relationships, agent type, commission, and settlement period. The default values and domain filters are typical for business logic. The _commercial_fields method extends inherited behavior without introducing external data or dynamic execution. There are no indications of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward extension of an Odoo model for managing partner-agent relationships. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears to be well-structured application code intended for business use.",
