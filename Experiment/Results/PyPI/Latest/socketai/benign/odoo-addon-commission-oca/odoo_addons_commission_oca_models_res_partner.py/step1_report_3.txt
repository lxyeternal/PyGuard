  "purpose": "Extend the 'res.partner' model in Odoo to add fields related to agents and commissions.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings, domain filters, default values, and the 'super()._commercial_fields()' method.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data inputs or external data sources are used that could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mainly defines fields and methods for data handling within the system.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines model extensions with fields and a simple method override. It does not include any user input handling, external network communication, or dynamic code execution. The fields are standard Odoo ORM fields, with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard model extension for Odoo, adding fields related to agents and commissions without any suspicious or malicious elements. No security concerns or malicious intent detected.",
