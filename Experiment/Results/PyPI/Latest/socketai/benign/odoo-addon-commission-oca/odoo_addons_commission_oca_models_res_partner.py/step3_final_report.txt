{
  "purpose": "Extend the res.partner model to include agent-related fields such as agent IDs, agent type, commission, and settlement details for business logic purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from existing res.partner records, domain filter on 'agent' field, default values for 'settlement', and inherited methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code defines fields and a method override without external data handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the model fields and the method '_commercial_fields' appending 'agent_ids' to inherited data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Odoo model extension, adding fields related to agents and commissions with typical ORM definitions. It uses a straightforward domain filter and a method override to extend inherited behavior. No external calls, dynamic execution, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The high confidence levels reflect the clarity and simplicity of the code, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe extension of the Odoo 'res.partner' model, with no malicious or security concerns. The reports correctly assess the code as benign, and the scoring aligns with the code's characteristics.",
