{
  "purpose": "This code performs a relative import of the module 'commission_make_settle' from the current package, likely for use within a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the module 'commission_make_settle' from the local package directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or external data flows; the code only imports a module without executing or passing data.",
  "flows": "The import source (local module) is loaded into the namespace, but no data flows or external interactions occur within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import, which is standard in Python projects. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues are evident. The import does not involve dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The current scoring (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) accurately reflects the code's safety. No modifications are necessary.",
