  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Import statement, no data flow or execution flow involving untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; only a simple relative import",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import statement. It imports a module named 'commission_make_settle' from the same package. There are no other code components, functions, or logic present to analyze. The import by itself is standard and does not pose security risks. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are detected. The minimal code suggests a basic module import with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple relative import statement with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger project, but as a standalone snippet, it shows no signs of malware or security risks.",
