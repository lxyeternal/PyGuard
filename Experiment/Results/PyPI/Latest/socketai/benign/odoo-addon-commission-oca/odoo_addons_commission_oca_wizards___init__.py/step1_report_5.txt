  "purpose": "Import the module 'commission_make_settle' from the current package",
  "sources": "Import statement indicating reading of a local module",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks observed",
  "flows": "Import statement does not involve data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; the only action is a relative import with no additional logic, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement importing 'commission_make_settle'. There are no input sources, data handling, or untrusted data flows. No obfuscation, malicious code, or anomalies are present. The import appears standard and benign, used likely for modular code organization. No malicious behavior or security risks are indicated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is typical for Python modules to use such imports for modularity. No further action needed.",
