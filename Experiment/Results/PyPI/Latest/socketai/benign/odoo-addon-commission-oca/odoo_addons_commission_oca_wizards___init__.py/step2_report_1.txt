  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is a simple import with no anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Security risk: 0.1, which seems slightly high given the minimal code, but perhaps considering potential misuse if the module is malicious elsewhere. Still, based solely on this snippet, this seems overestimated.\n- Confidence: 0.9, reasonable given the straightforward nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same as above, consistent with a benign import.\n- Malware score: 0, appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0.1, again possibly overestimating risk based solely on an import statement.\n- Confidence: 0.9, consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar conclusion, no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0, appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0, as no risks are evident.\n- Confidence: 0.9, reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same reasoning; standard relative import, no signs of malicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0, appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0.1, possibly slightly high but acceptable given the minimal code.\n- Confidence: 0.8, slightly lower but still reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as above, straightforward import.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0, aligns with the benign nature.\n- Confidence: 1, high confidence in benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Recommendations:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly inconsistent—some are 0.1, others 0. The risk score for such a benign import should generally be 0 unless there's additional context indicating potential misuse.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is correct.\n- **Confidence levels:** Mostly high, reflecting the straightforward nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correct.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 for all, as an import statement alone does not pose a security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nGiven the simplicity of the code, **the most accurate scores** should be:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo evidence suggests malicious intent or security issues based solely on this import statement.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If future code snippets involve dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or data handling, reassessment would be necessary.",
