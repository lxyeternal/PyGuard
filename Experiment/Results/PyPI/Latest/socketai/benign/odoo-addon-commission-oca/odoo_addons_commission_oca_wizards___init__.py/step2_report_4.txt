  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code is a simple import statement with no anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate, as no malicious activity is indicated.\n- Security risk: 0.1 — perhaps slightly overestimating, but given the minimal code, this is acceptable.\n- Confidence: 0.9 — justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, straightforward import with no issues.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0.1 — possibly slightly high, but acceptable for such minimal code.\n- Confidence: 0.9 — justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion: a simple import statement, benign.\n- Malware score: 0 — correct.\n- Security risk: 0 — consistent with the minimal code.\n- Confidence: 0.9 — justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, a straightforward relative import with no anomalies.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0.1 — perhaps a bit high for such minimal code, but not unreasonable.\n- Confidence: 0.8 — slightly lower, but still justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as others, a benign import statement.\n- Malware score: 0 — correct.\n- Security risk: 0 — consistent.\n- Confidence: 1 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of observations:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate given the code snippet.\n- The security risk scores are slightly above zero in most cases, which might be conservative but acceptable given the minimal context.\n- Confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code snippet is a standard import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent across reports.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, given the context; could be zero, but a slight buffer is acceptable.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, and the current scores reflect that accurately.",
