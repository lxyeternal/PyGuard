{
  "purpose": "The code implements a wizard for settling commissions, managing settlement periods, and creating settlement records based on agent data.",
  "sources": "Input data from user inputs (date_to, agent_ids, settlement_type), environment models (res.partner, commission.settlement), and external libraries (dateutil.relativedelta).",
  "sinks": "Database operations such as search, create, and update on models (commission.settlement, commission.settlement.line), and environment calls (self.env).",
  "flows": "Input data (agent info, date) flows into period calculations, settlement searches, and creation of settlement records, with data being fetched and written into the database models.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. Use of standard libraries and Odoo framework functions appears typical; no hidden network calls, file manipulations, or reverse shell behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard Odoo module for managing commission settlements. It includes typical date calculations, database searches, and record creation functions. All data flows seem to involve database lookups and modifications, consistent with normal business logic. There are no signs of malicious code such as hidden network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code does not perform any obfuscated operations or suspicious file/network activities. External dependencies are standard and used appropriately.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Odoo module designed for commission settlement management. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious anomalies detected. The code is straightforward with no evidence of malicious intent.",
