{
  "purpose": "Metadata and dependency information for the 'Commissions OCA' Odoo module.",
  "sources": "Reads data files such as XML, CSV, and demo files listed in the 'data' and 'demo' fields.",
  "sinks": "Configuration files and data files that may define access controls and UI views, but do not directly handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable as this is a manifest/configuration file; no data flows are explicitly present.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only metadata and references to data files; no executable or suspicious code is present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a JSON-like manifest for an Odoo module, listing dependencies, data files, security files, and metadata. No executable code, input handling, or data processing logic is present. The security files included are standard and suggest role-based access control configurations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module manifest for an Odoo application. It appears legitimate, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. The code mainly provides metadata and references to data files without executing or processing data itself.",
