  "purpose": "Static manifest/configuration file for an Odoo module, defining metadata, dependencies, data files, and security references.",
  "sources": "References to security XMLs, CSVs, views, reports, and demo data files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Static references from manifest to data files; no data flow or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static manifest with metadata and references to data files typical for an Odoo module. No executable scripts, dynamic logic, or suspicious patterns are present. All references are standard, and the structure is straightforward. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with a benign, static configuration. Confidence is high due to the static nature and lack of executable code.",
  "conclusion": "The manifest is a benign, standard Odoo module declaration with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the static analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
