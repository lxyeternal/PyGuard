  "purpose": "Define models for commission settlement and settlement lines in an Odoo module, managing settlement data and related fields.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (_default_currency_id, _default_company_id), user inputs in form fields, related fields, and data from linked models.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include model methods that modify state (action_cancel), auto-subscribing followers, and computed fields that depend on related data.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and user inputs set default values -> related fields and computed fields derive data -> methods like action_cancel modify model state; auto-subscribe followers modifies notifications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Methods are standard for Odoo models, with placeholder methods for extension. No obfuscated code or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes Odoo models for managing commission settlements, with standard field definitions, default value methods, computed fields, and a method to cancel a settlement. The code follows typical Odoo practices, with no signs of malicious behavior. The placeholder methods suggest extensibility but do not implement any suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or malicious data handling is evident. The auto-subscribe method respects usual notification patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of Odoo models for managing commissions with no malicious intent. It does not contain malware or security risks. Its structure and content do not indicate obfuscation or malicious behavior. Overall, the code is safe and typical for its purpose.",
