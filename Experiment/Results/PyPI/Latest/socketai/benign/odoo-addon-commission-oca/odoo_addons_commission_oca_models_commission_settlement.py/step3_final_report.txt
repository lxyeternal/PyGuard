{
  "purpose": "Defines Odoo models for managing commission settlements and their lines, including fields for dates, agents, amounts, and related data, with extension hooks for customization.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for defaults, user inputs for fields, related fields from linked models, and internal method calls for computations and state changes.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables for default currency and company, updates model states (e.g., 'cancel'), and appends followers in messaging system; no external network calls or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and related fields provide default data; user inputs and related model data flow into computed fields and state changes; extension hooks allow for further data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; placeholder methods for extension are standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Odoo models with typical fields, default environment-based values, and extension points. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The use of environment variables is safe and common. The placeholder methods are designed for extension and do not introduce risks. The scoring of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 is consistent with the code's benign and standard nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Odoo module for managing commission settlements, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
