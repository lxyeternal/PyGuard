  "purpose": "Define models for managing commission settlements and their lines within the Odoo framework.",
  "sources": "Reads environment data (e.g., env.company.currency_id, env.company.id), related fields, and user input via fields such as settlement_type and agent_id.",
  "sinks": "Uses write method to change state in action_cancel; appends to followers list in _message_auto_subscribe_followers.",
  "flows": "User or system input updates agent_id or settlement_type, which trigger computations (_compute_total, _compute_can_edit); state change via action_cancel; message subscription updates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code primarily consists of standard Odoo model definitions and computed fields.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes Odoo models with fields, dependencies, and simple methods for workflow control. All methods utilize standard Odoo ORM functions and hooks. No suspicious data flows, external network calls, or code injections are present. The code mainly manages internal data states and user interactions without any malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Odoo module defining models for commission settlement management. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified. The only potential concern is the use of write and append operations which are standard and safe within Odoo's context.",
