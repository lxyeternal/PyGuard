{
  "purpose": "The code performs validation of blockchain nodes by sending small transactions to predefined validation contracts on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Solana networks.",
  "sources": "Reads private keys, RPC URLs, and blockchain balances.",
  "sinks": "Sends signed transactions to blockchain networks, potentially exposing private keys if misused.",
  "flows": "From private key input (source) to signing and broadcasting transactions (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. Uses standard library calls; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs. No suspicious network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script loads private keys, checks node connectivity, retrieves balances, and constructs validation transactions for each blockchain. It signs and broadcasts these transactions using standard Web3 and Solana SDK functions. The code appears to perform legitimate validation tasks without evident malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code behaviors are present. The operations are typical for node validation and do not include malicious payloads or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate blockchain node validation by sending small transactions to predefined validation contracts. No malicious or backdoor behaviors are detected. It does not include malicious code or suspicious network activity. The overall risk is low, with no indication of malware or security threats.",
