{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to validate blockchain nodes by performing small value transfers on Ethereum, BSC, and Solana networks to ensure connectivity and functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data such as private keys (`from_private_key`) and RPC URLs (`rpc_url`). It also retrieves account balances and transaction nonces from blockchain nodes.",
  "sinks": "The code creates and signs transactions that are broadcasted to blockchain networks, potentially transferring maximum possible balances minus fees, which could deplete accounts.",
  "flows": "Input private keys and RPC URLs are used to connect to blockchain nodes, retrieve balances and nonces, then construct, sign, and send transactions to validate node accessibility.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs automatic transfers of almost entire account balances, which is unusual behavior for validation scripts, indicating possible malicious intent to drain funds. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present, but the pattern of draining balances is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains functions to connect to Ethereum, BSC, and Solana networks, retrieve account balances, and send transactions. It deducts transaction fees from balances and sends the maximum transferable amount to predefined validation addresses. This behavior resembles an attempt to drain or deplete accounts, which is suspicious. The code does not include any data exfiltration or hidden backdoors but performs potentially destructive operations under the guise of validation. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious-looking language features, but the core logic of draining funds is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script's primary function appears to be testing node connectivity by draining nearly all account funds through validation transactions, which could be malicious if used without user consent. This behavior aligns with malicious activity like fund depletion, rather than benign validation.",
