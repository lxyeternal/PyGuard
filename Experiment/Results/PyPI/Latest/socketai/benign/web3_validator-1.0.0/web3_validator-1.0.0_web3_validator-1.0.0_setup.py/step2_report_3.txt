  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and compare them to the provided code.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code is a standard Python `setup.py` script.\n- It reads `README.md` for the long description.\n- Calls `setup()` with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.\n- Uses common blockchain-related dependencies (`web3`, `solana`, `solders`).\n- No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- The code matches the descriptions in all reports.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n- All dependencies are standard and relevant.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or untrusted data processing.\n- The code is a typical setup script.\n\n### Issues in the Reports:\n- **Logical flaws or errors:** None. All reports correctly identify the code as a straightforward setup script.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - `malware`: 0 across all reports, which is accurate.\n  - `obfuscated`: 0, also correct.\n  - `securityRisk`: 0, consistent with the analysis.\n  - `confidence`: 1, appropriate given the clear and standard nature of the code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n- **Risk justification:** Since there's no malicious activity, the risk score remains at 0.\n- **Malware and obfuscated scores:** Correctly set to 0, as no malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities that are not supported by the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Justification:** The code is a standard, static package setup script with no suspicious or malicious behavior. All dependencies are common, and there are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No changes are necessary. The overall security posture of this code is benign, and it appears to be a legitimate package configuration script.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.  \n- Confirm that no hidden or malicious intent exists, which is supported by the code review.\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for future updates or changes, but based on this static analysis, the code is safe.",
