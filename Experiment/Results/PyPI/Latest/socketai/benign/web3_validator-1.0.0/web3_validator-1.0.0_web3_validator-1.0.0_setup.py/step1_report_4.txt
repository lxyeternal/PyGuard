{
  "purpose": "Configure and prepare a Python package named 'web3_validator' for distribution via setup tools.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; static setup parameters such as name, version, author info, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; no code executes untrusted input or writes data externally.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; setup configuration is static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are detected. The code is straightforward package setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools', reads a Markdown README file for long description, and calls 'setup()' with package metadata and dependencies. There are no functions or dynamic behaviors, nor any code that handles user input, network operations, or sensitive data. The dependencies listed are standard blockchain libraries. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues within this setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious code, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks. The code serves solely to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
