  "purpose": "Configure a Python package named 'web3_validator' with metadata and dependencies for blockchain utilities.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata in setup()",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing; no runtime data handling",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static configuration only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools, with static metadata and dependencies. It reads a README file and calls setup() with fixed parameters. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or secrets are present. Dependencies are common blockchain libraries. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent and appropriate given the code's simplicity and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package configuration script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
