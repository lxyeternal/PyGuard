{
  "purpose": "Configure and set up a Python package named 'web3_validator' for distribution, including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "File read operation for 'README.md' to obtain long description; static strings for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected. No data or input from external sources is processed or written in a vulnerable way.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only reads a file and provides static configuration data, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard setup configuration for a Python package, including reading the README file for long description and specifying dependencies. All code is static, with no dynamic execution or untrusted input processing. The dependencies listed are common Python packages related to blockchain interactions. There are no signs of malicious activity or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate configuration for a Python package intended for blockchain utility functions.",
