  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'web3_validator' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; no other input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is written or executed.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' -> use in 'long_description'; no data flows to external systems or untrusted code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, standard setup procedure with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup configuration for a Python package, including reading a Markdown README for description, specifying package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No external data is processed beyond the initial file read. No code execution, input handling, or network activity is present. The dependencies are common packages for blockchain interactions but do not indicate malicious intent. The code adheres to typical packaging practices without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
