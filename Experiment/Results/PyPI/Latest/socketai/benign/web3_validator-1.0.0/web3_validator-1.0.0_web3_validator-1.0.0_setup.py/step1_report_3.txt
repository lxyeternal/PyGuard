  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'web3_validator', providing package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; static code defining package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling; no input/output operations that process untrusted data at runtime.",
  "flows": "N/A - the script is static configuration and file reading without user input or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be standard setup configuration with no suspicious code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file for description, then calls setup() with static package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No user input, network operations, or secret handling present. No code injection, obfuscation, or malicious logic identified. The dependencies listed are common blockchain-related libraries, not suspicious or malicious. Overall, this is a typical setup script with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security concerns identified.",
