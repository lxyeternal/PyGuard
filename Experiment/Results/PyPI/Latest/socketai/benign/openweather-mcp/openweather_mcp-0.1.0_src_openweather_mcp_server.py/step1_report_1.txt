{
  "purpose": "This code interfaces with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on city names or coordinates, and exposes functions as tools via an MCP server.",
  "sources": "The code reads the API key from the environment variable 'OPENWEATHER_API_KEY' and user inputs for city names or coordinates.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into HTTP request parameters; API responses are parsed and returned as data models.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (city names or coordinates) are used to construct API requests; responses are processed and returned as structured data.",
  "anomalies": "The API key is obtained via an environment variable, which is standard; no hardcoded secrets are present. No suspicious or unusual code constructs detected. The code uses standard libraries and clear request patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code fetches the API key securely from environment variables, reducing risk of secret leakage in code. It constructs API requests based on user input and processes responses accordingly. The code handles errors by raising exceptions with informative messages. There are no indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network connections. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is present. The code’s structure and usage patterns are typical for a weather data retrieval service.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for interacting with the OpenWeatherMap API, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. It properly manages secrets, handles errors, and uses well-known libraries without suspicious modifications.",
