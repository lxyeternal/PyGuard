  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the openweather_mcp package and related API interactions.",
  "sources": "None (the code only defines classes; no input or data reading occurs).",
  "sinks": "None (no data processing, output, or external data handling present).",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code uses standard class definitions with docstrings and pass statements.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class and a parent MCPError. The purpose is to structure error handling for the package. No input sources, data flows, or sinks are present. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The use of pass statements indicates no additional logic or malicious payloads. There are no hardcoded credentials, external calls, or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign definition of custom exceptions for error handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The purpose is purely organizational for exception handling within the package.",
