  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code is purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class, with descriptive docstrings. No input reading, no external data handling, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard class inheritance for exception handling with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
