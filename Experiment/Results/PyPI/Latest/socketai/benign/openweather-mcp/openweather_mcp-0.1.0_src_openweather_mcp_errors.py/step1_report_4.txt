  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in the openweather_mcp package and related API interactions.",
  "sources": "No input reading; exception class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions. These classes inherit from Python's Exception class and serve as error handlers for the package. There are no function calls, data processing, network activity, or other suspicious operations. The code is straightforward, minimal, and typical for structured exception handling in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for defining custom exceptions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
