  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the openweather_mcp package.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading points; class definitions do not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, output, or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward class definitions with no unusual or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception and MCPError base class, with docstrings describing their purpose. There are no data input points, no data leaks, no external communications, or dynamic code execution. The structure is standard and appears benign. The code does not perform any malicious activities, nor does it contain obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard definition of custom exceptions for error handling. It poses no security risk, no malware, and contains no malicious behavior.",
