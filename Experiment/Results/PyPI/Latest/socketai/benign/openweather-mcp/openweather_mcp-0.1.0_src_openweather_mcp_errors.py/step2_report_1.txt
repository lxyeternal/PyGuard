  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the actual code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class, with no data processing, external calls, or dynamic behaviors. The code is straightforward and standard for error handling in Python packages.  \n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their descriptions. They correctly note the absence of anomalies, suspicious constructs, or malicious intent. There are no logical flaws or misinterpretations.  \n**Conclusion:** No errors or flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature. The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward analysis.  \n**Conclusion:** The scores seem appropriate and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**  \nSince the code is purely class definitions with no malicious activity, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0. No justification exists for higher scores.  \n**Conclusion:** No adjustments needed.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the actual code content, which is minimal and benign.  \n**Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Report Content**  \nThe scores are consistent with the code's nature. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns.**",
