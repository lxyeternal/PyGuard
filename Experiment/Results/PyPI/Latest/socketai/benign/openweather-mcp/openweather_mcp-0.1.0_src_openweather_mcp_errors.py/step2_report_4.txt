  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No input, data flow, or external communication is involved.\n- No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscation are detected.\n- The code appears to be standard Python exception class definitions with appropriate inheritance and docstrings.\n\n**Confirmations and assessments:**\n- The code snippets in all reports match the original code provided.\n- There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The purpose across reports is consistent: defining custom exception classes for error handling in the package.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The confidence score is 1 in all reports, which is justified given the straightforward, well-understood code.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reasoning in all reports is sound; no overestimation of risk.\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No modifications needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports correctly identify that this code is purely structural, with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and the reasoning is sound. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
