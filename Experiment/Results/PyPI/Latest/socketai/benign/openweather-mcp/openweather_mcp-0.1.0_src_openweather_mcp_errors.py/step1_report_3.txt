  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to the openweather_mcp package and OpenWeather API.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and docstrings, no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output mechanisms present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; code only defines exception classes without execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with standard exception inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. The first class MCPError serves as a base class for all exceptions in the package, with a descriptive docstring. The second class OpenWeatherError inherits from MCPError, indicating specialization for errors related to the OpenWeather API. The code contains no suspicious behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, and no dynamic code execution. There are no data leaks, malicious payloads, or obfuscation present. The code appears to be a standard pattern for error handling in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains no anomalies or suspicious behaviors.",
