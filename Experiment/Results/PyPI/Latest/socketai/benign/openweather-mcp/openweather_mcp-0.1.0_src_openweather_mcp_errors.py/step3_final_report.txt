  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling within the openweather_mcp package.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception and MCPError; no external data sources or input mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely class inheritance with no dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with descriptive docstrings and no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. There are no data inputs, external calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The classes serve as error types with descriptive docstrings. The code is standard and benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the code's nature. The confidence level is high (1) due to the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports accurately assess the code as safe, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
