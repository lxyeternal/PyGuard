  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content:**\n```python\nclass MCPError(Exception):\n    \"\"\"Base class for all exceptions raised by the openweather_mcp package.\"\"\"\n    pass\n\nclass OpenWeatherError(MCPError):\n    \"\"\"Base class for all exceptions raised by the OpenWeather API.\"\"\"\n```\n\n2. **Assessment of the Code:**\n- The code only defines two custom exception classes, inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n- The classes include descriptive docstrings.\n- The `pass` statement in `MCPError` indicates no additional logic.\n- `OpenWeatherError` inherits from `MCPError` but contains no further implementation.\n\n3. **Security Analysis Based on Reports:**\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n- The code is straightforward, typical for error handling in Python packages.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n4. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the benign nature of class definitions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, since the code only defines exception classes without any malicious payloads or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Issues:**\n- All reports agree on the benign nature.\n- The purpose of the code is purely organizational, setting up custom exceptions.\n- No reason to adjust the scores; they are appropriate.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions.\n- No malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no security risks or malicious intent. The reported scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
