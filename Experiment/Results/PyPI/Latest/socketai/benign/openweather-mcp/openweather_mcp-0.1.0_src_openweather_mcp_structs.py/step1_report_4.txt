  "purpose": "Define data models for weather-related API responses and internal data structures.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attribute definitions, and data fields within classes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is processed or output to external systems within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., API responses) into data models; no external data sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines data models using Pydantic and standard Python types, with no input validation beyond data schema. No data is being read from external sources, nor are there any write or network operations. It utilizes standard modules (datetime, typing) and Pydantic features for schema enforcement. There are no apparent malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks. The use of 'extra=\"ignore\"' in model configuration is standard practice for flexible data parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data schema definition for weather data, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a safe and standard implementation for modeling API responses.",
