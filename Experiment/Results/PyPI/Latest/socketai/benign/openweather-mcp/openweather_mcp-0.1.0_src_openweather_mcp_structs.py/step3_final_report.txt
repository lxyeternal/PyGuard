  "purpose": "Define data models for weather API responses using Pydantic for validation and serialization.",
  "sources": "Code imports and class definitions, primarily from standard libraries and Pydantic.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API responses into the data models; no external or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, declarative, and uses standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data model classes for weather information, utilizing Pydantic for validation. It imports standard modules and defines models with fields and descriptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not perform any network operations, handle secrets, or execute dynamic code. The structure is clean, and the purpose is clear—schema definition for weather data. Given the absence of suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security issues, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of data models for weather API responses. It contains no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, which is consistent with the analysis. The confidence in this conclusion is high.",
