  "purpose": "Defines data models for weather-related API responses using Pydantic and Python type annotations.",
  "sources": "Input data from API responses (e.g., JSON payloads for weather data).",
  "sinks": "Potential data processing or storage functions (not present here), no direct sink in this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API input into Pydantic models for validation and structure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of standard libraries and type annotations with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and third-party 'pydantic' for data validation. It defines data structures for weather data, including nested models and configurations. No input handling, external network calls, or sensitive data processing are present. The code appears to be a straightforward schema definition for weather API responses. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are detected. The structure and content are typical for data modeling in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of data models for weather API responses, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
