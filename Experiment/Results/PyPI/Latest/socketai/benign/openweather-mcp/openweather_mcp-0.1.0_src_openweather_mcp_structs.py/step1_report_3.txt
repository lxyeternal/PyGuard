  "purpose": "Define data models for weather-related API responses using Pydantic and Python type hints.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, datetime module, typing.NamedTuple, Pydantic classes, class attributes and annotations.",
  "sinks": "None; the code primarily defines data structures and does not handle untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "N/A; data models define schemas and do not process untrusted data directly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures observed. The code solely defines data models with no execution of dynamic code or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations, datetime, typing.NamedTuple, and pydantic modules to define structured data models for weather information. It includes classes like Coordinate, APIModel, WeatherCondition, WeatherMain, WeatherWind, WeatherResponse, and ForecastResponse. These models specify fields with types, default values, and descriptions. No input parsing, external calls, or code execution occurs within this snippet. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The structure is straightforward, serving to validate and serialize weather data schemas.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, defining data schemas for weather API responses. There are no malicious behaviors, security issues, or obfuscation present. It appears to be safe and intended for data validation purposes only.",
