  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard testing script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or high security risk. The use of environment variables is appropriate, and JSON responses are handled securely. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern primarily related to environment variable handling, which is standard practice."
