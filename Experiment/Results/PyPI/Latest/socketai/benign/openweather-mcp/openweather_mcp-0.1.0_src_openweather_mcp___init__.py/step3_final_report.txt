{
  "purpose": "A minimal Python module that imports a local 'server' module and defines a main() function calling server.main(), exposing these via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from . import server', usage of 'server.main()' within main()",
  "sinks": "Calling server.main() potentially executes code within the 'server' module; no other untrusted data sources present",
  "flows": "main() calls server.main(), which could execute code within 'server' module upon invocation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; code is straightforward and minimal",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple wrapper module that delegates execution to an external 'server' module. It does not process input, handle data, or perform network operations itself. The security implications depend entirely on the trustworthiness of the 'server' module, which is external and not provided. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present in this snippet. The malware score is appropriately 0, as there is no malicious code. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code's clarity. The security risk score is low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk but acknowledging dependency on an external module. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and does not contain malicious or obfuscated elements. The primary security concern hinges on the trustworthiness of the external 'server' module, which cannot be assessed here. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this analysis, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0 and a low security risk score. No further action is necessary; the code itself is safe, and risks are external.",
