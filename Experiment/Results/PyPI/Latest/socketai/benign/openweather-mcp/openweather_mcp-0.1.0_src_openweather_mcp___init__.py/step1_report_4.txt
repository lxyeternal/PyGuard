{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point that imports a module named 'server' and defines a main() function to invoke server.main(). It also specifies the exported symbols.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'server' module; no external input sources are explicitly read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "The code calls server.main(), which could potentially perform untrusted operations, but this cannot be determined without examining the 'server' module itself.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: main() calls server.main(), with no data passing from untrusted sources within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated elements, or unusual patterns. No suspicious or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports another module and defines a main entry point. It relies on the imported server module's behavior. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data leaks, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The security posture depends on the implementation of server.main(), which is not shown here. The code structure is clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign and standard as a module entry point. No malicious intent or security risks are identifiable within this snippet, but full assessment depends on the 'server' module's implementation.",
