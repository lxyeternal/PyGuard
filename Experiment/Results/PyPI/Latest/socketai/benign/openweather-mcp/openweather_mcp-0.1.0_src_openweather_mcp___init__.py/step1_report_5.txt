  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point that imports a server module and calls its main function, then defines exports.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing the server module; no input reading or data sources present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling, no data leaks, no external communication or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The main function simply calls server.main(), which is an external function not provided here.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected in this minimal snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing a module and defining a main function that delegates to server.main(). No suspicious activity, no data handling, no network operations, and no obfuscated code. The import appears standard, and the code structure is typical for a Python module acting as an entry point.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, acting as a simple wrapper to execute server.main(). There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
