{
  "purpose": "This code imports a server module and defines a main function that calls server.main(), then exports main and server for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported module 'server' and the __all__ variable declaration.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "The main() function calls server.main(), which could be a flow if server.main() contains untrusted input handling, but this code itself does not process data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module named 'server' and defines a simple main() function that delegates execution to server.main(). It then exposes main and server via __all__. There are no apparent malicious behaviors, data processing, or insecure practices in this snippet. The simplicity indicates standard module wiring, with no suspicious or malicious actions detectable at this level.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic module setup with a delegated main function. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears to be standard boilerplate code for a Python package.",
