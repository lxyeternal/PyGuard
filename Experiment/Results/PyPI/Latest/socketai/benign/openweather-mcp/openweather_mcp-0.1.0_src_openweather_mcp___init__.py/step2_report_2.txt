  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications, scoring, and consistency.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe very similar code: a minimal module importing 'server' and defining a main() that calls server.main().\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected.\n- The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the 'server' module, which cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code in the provided snippet.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting the minimal code and the reliance on external module integrity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is straightforward and does not contain any issues or vulnerabilities in itself.\n- No evidence of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- None detected. The reasoning that the code is benign and the main risk depends on the 'server' module is sound.\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a simple wrapper.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- Malware score: consistently 0, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n- Security risk: very low (0.1 to 0.2), reasonable given the context.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- The only potential risk is if the 'server' module is malicious or compromised, but this cannot be determined from the snippet.\n- Since the code merely delegates execution, the risk is minimal but not zero if the external module is malicious.\n- The reports' scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The reports do not overstate or understate the risk; they correctly note that the security concern hinges on the 'server' module's trustworthiness.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond what is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, dependent on external module trust)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since external module could be malicious, but not evidenced here)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, standard entry point module with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security concern is external module trust, which is outside the scope of this snippet. The scores in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores; they accurately reflect the minimal risk based on the provided code.",
