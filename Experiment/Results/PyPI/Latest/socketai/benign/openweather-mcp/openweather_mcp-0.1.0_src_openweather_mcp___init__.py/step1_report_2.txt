{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point module that imports a 'server' module and defines a main() function that calls server.main(). It also exports 'main' and 'server' for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement for the local 'server' module; the main() function calling server.main()",
  "sinks": "The call to server.main() could potentially execute untrusted code if 'server' is malicious or compromised",
  "flows": "Import 'server' -> execute main() -> call server.main()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward and typical for a Python package entry point",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module named 'server' and defines a main() function that delegates execution to server.main(). It exports the main() function and the server module via __all__. The code is minimal and standard, with no suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated features. The only potential concern is if the 'server' module itself is malicious, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, benign entry point for a Python package. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident in this snippet. The main concern depends on the trustworthiness of the 'server' module, which cannot be assessed here.",
