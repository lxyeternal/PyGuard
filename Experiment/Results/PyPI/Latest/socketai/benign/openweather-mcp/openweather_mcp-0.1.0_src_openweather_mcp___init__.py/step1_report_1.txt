{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'server' and defines a main function that calls server.main(), then exposes these two components for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'server' module.",
  "sinks": "The code calls server.main(), which could potentially execute malicious code if the 'server' module is compromised or maliciously altered.",
  "flows": "The main function calls server.main(), which is a direct source-to-sink flow that could execute code within the 'server' module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and standard, importing a 'server' module and delegating execution to its main function. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behavior. The only potential concern is the reliance on an external 'server' module; if that module is malicious or compromised, it could execute harmful actions. However, based solely on this snippet, there are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, functioning as a simple wrapper to invoke 'server.main()'. There are no evident malicious behaviors or security issues in this fragment. The security risk hinges entirely on the integrity of the 'server' module it imports.",
