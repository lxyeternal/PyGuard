  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is minimal, straightforward, and functions as a simple wrapper calling `server.main()`.\n   - There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code's only potential risk depends on the behavior of the `server` module, which isn't shown here.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code itself appears benign.\n   - They appropriately note that security concerns hinge on the `server` module's integrity.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores review:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - Security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), which seems reasonable given the minimal code and reliance on an external module.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n   - Confidence levels are high (0.8–1), appropriate for such straightforward code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code itself is benign, higher risk scores are unjustified unless the `server` module is malicious.\n   - The reports do not assume maliciousness but acknowledge that if `server` is compromised, risks could escalate.\n   - Therefore, the low risk scores are justified based on the code snippet alone.\n\n5. **Malware score reflection:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given no malicious behavior is evident.\n   - The only concern is the trustworthiness of the `server` module, but that is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, correctly stating that maliciousness depends on the external module.\n   - No report claims the module is malicious without evidence.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis—low malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores, with high confidence.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, dependent on external module trust)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reported scores. The code is benign and straightforward, with security considerations primarily external.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Score |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware          | 0               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0               |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1             |\n\nThe overall risk remains low unless the `server` module is compromised. The code snippet itself does not warrant concern.",
