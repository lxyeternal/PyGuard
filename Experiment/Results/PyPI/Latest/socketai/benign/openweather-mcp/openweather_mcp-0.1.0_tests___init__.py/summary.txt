  "conclusion": "The reports are internally consistent, with suspicion levels justified by code features like obfuscation and dynamic execution. Adjustments to Report 2's malware score improve alignment with described suspicious behaviors. Overall, the package warrants cautious review before deployment, given the moderate suspicion and obfuscation levels."
