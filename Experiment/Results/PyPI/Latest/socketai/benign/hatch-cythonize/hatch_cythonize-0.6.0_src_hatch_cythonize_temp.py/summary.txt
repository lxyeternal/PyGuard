  "conclusion": "The code is a benign template generator for setup scripts, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security concern is ensuring inputs are sanitized to prevent injection. The scores across reports are consistent and justified. Assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a moderate risk score (~0.3) to reflect potential injection risk if inputs are untrusted."
