  "purpose": "Generate a setup script for building Cython extensions based on provided options and files.",
  "sources": "Options such as compile_args, directives, includes, libraries, and files provided as function arguments and options object.",
  "sinks": "The formatted code string that, if options contain malicious content, could lead to code injection in the generated setup script.",
  "flows": "Options and file lists are interpolated into the code template via string.format(), creating the final script content.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting with untrusted inputs without sanitization; no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a Python setup script as a string, inserting various configuration options through string formatting. It does not execute code dynamically or perform network operations. The primary security concern is potential code injection if options are maliciously crafted, but the code itself is straightforward and benign. All reports correctly identify that the code is a template generator with no embedded malicious payloads or obfuscation. The malware score is appropriately zero; the risk score varies from 0.2 to 0.4 depending on input trust assumptions. Given the context, a balanced risk estimate of 0.3 is suitable, assuming proper input validation. The overall assessment is that the code is safe, with the main security consideration being input sanitization to prevent injection vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign template generator for setup scripts, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security concern is ensuring inputs are sanitized to prevent injection. The scores across reports are consistent and justified. Assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a moderate risk score (~0.3) to reflect potential injection risk if inputs are untrusted.",
