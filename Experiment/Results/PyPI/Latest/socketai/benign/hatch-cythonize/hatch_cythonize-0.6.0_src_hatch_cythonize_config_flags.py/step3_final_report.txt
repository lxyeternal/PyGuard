  "purpose": "Manage and parse environment variables and build flags for a Python build system, merging external environment data with user-defined configurations.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ.get(), user input arguments parsed into EnvFlag objects.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable dictionary self.env, masked_environ() outputs for display.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read from os.environ, merged into self.env via merge_to_env(), and masked for display.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code handles environment variables in a standard manner.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for environment flags and manages merging environment variables with options for concatenation or override. It parses user inputs into EnvFlag objects, merges them with existing environment variables, and masks values for privacy. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The environment variables are manipulated via standard Python practices, with potential external manipulation as a known risk but not malicious. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or backdoors. The risk stems from external environment variable manipulation, which is typical in build systems but can be exploited if inputs are malicious. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is conservatively set to 0.2 to reflect this known but accepted risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, manages environment variables securely within typical build system practices, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The slight security risk is inherent to environment variable handling but does not indicate malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
