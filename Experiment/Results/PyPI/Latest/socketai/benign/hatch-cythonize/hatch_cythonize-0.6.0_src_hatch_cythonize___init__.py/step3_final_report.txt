  "purpose": "Import registration for hatch_cythonize build hooks and plugins, likely part of build configuration.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from hatch_cythonize.hooks and hatch_cythonize.plugin modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external interactions; purely static import statements.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with only license comments and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only license comments and two static import statements. No data processing, dynamic code execution, external communication, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware score 0, obfuscation 0, and very low security risk (~0.1). The code appears to be part of build configuration or plugin registration, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The high confidence scores (mostly 1) are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or security concerns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a standard build configuration snippet. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
