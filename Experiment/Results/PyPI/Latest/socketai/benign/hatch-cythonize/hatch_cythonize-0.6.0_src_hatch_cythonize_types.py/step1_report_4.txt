  "purpose": "Define type aliases and conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, and typing_extensions modules; version_info tuple.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or could cause data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present; code primarily sets up type aliases and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The version-based conditional imports are standard practice for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version to conditionally import modules and define type aliases for compatibility across Python versions. It uses version_info from sys, conditional import statements, and type alias definitions. No dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input, and no suspicious logic or backdoors are present. The code appears to be a standard setup for type annotations with compatibility considerations, with no malicious or security risk signals.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical version compatibility setup for type annotations in Python. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign utility code segment that ensures proper typing imports depending on the Python version.",
