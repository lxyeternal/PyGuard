{
  "purpose": "The code primarily handles type annotations and compatibility checks for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version info from sys.version_info; imports modules based on version; defines type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No sink locations where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful effects are present.",
  "flows": "Version info is read to determine which modules to import; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports modules and defines type aliases based on the Python version. It uses sys.version_info to check the runtime environment and selectively imports from 'collections.abc' or 'typing' accordingly. No external inputs, network operations, or data processing are involved. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard compatibility and type annotation setup code with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
