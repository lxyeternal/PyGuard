  "purpose": "Manage Python version compatibility for importing modules and define type aliases for annotations based on the runtime version.",
  "sources": "Reads sys.version_info to determine Python version; imports modules conditionally based on version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code performs environment checks and type aliasing only.",
  "flows": "Version info read from sys.version_info; conditional imports based on version; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version and conditionally imports modules for compatibility, defining type aliases accordingly. It performs no data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. The logic is straightforward, standard, and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility utility for type annotations, with no malicious behavior or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and high confidence.",
