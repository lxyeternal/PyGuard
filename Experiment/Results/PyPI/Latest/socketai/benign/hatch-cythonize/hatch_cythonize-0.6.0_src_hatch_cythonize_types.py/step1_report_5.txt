  "purpose": "The code is setting up type aliases and importing modules based on Python version to ensure compatibility, mainly for type annotations and platform-specific behaviors.",
  "sources": [
    "import of 'version_info' from sys",
    "import of 'Literal', 'TypeVar', 'Union' from typing",
    "conditional imports of 'collections.abc.Callable' and 'typing_extensions.ParamSpec' depending on Python version"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure actions are present."
  ],
  "flows": [
    "version_info is used to determine the Python version and conditionally import modules and define type aliases accordingly."
  ],
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are detected. The code uses standard Python practices for version compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system and typing modules, then defines version-dependent imports and type aliases for compatibility. It adjusts imports and definitions based on the Python version, which is a common pattern to ensure compatibility across different environments. No data is read from or written to untrusted sources. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks. The use of conditional imports and type annotations is standard and does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a compatibility setup for type annotations and module imports based on Python version. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
