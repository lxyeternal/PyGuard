  "purpose": "Define type aliases and import modules based on Python version for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, and typing_extensions; version_info from sys.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports modules and defines type aliases based on the Python interpreter version. It uses standard library features and typing constructs for compatibility across Python versions. No dynamic execution, input processing, or external communication occurs. No suspicious logic, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility and type alias setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
