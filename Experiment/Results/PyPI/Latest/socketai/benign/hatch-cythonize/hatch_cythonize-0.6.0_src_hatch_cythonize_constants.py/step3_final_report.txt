  "purpose": "Configuration setup for build directives, file extensions, and platform detection in a Python project involving Cython.",
  "sources": "Import from 'hatch_cythonize.types'; constants and regex patterns defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; all data is statically defined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type definitions and sets up constants, regex patterns, and extension sets related to build processes. It does not perform any data processing, dynamic code execution, or network activity. The structure is typical for configuration modules, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious behavior. The risk score is 0, given the static and benign nature. The code's simplicity and lack of external data handling support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module with no malicious or security risks. All reports' assessments are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
