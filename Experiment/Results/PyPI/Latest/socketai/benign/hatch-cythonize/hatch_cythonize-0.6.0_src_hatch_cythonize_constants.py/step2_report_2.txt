  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**  \n   All reports consistently conclude that the code is straightforward configuration, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The code consists of constant definitions, imports, and set initializations related to build configurations and file extensions. There are no dynamic operations, user inputs, network activity, or data flows that could be exploited.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \n   The code appears correct and typical for its purpose. No logical flaws or errors are identified. The constants and sets are well-defined, and the imports are appropriate.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. This seems appropriate.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a higher risk score. The code is static, configuration-related, and free of suspicious patterns.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions and Claims:**  \n   All assessments correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent. They recognize the code as benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**  \nThe code is a benign configuration module with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Estimated Scores Based on the Review:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scoring and analysis are appropriate and should remain as is.",
