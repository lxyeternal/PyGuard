  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify that the code is purely configuration, with no dynamic or untrusted data handling.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.\n- The code mainly imports types and defines constants, sets, and regex patterns relevant to build processes involving Cython and platform detection.\n- No network activity, user input, or external data processing is present.\n- The malware score across all reports is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code snippets.\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0, which is appropriate given the static configuration nature.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0 or very low (0.5 or below), consistent with the findings.\n- **Malware score justification:** Zero, as no malicious behavior is detected or implied.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** None are made; the analysis is cautious and based on code content.\n- **Score consistency:** The scores align well with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review:\n- The reports are thorough and conservative, correctly concluding that the code is benign.\n- No evidence suggests any malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n- The configuration appears standard and safe.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the detailed reports and consistent findings, I agree with their conclusions. The code is purely configuration with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- Maintain the conservative stance that the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward configuration module for build settings, with no malicious or security concerns. The provided reports are accurate and justified in their assessments.",
