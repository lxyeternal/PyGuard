  "purpose": "Define constants, import types, and set configurations related to Python project build and platform handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'hatch_cythonize.types'; string and set definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sink points where untrusted data leads to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Import statements are static; constants and sets are defined without dynamic or untrusted input; no flow of untrusted data to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution or external data reads are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static definitions: importing types, setting string constants, and defining sets of file extensions. There are no user inputs, network operations, or dynamic evaluations. All variables are statically assigned, and there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code appears to serve configuration purposes for a build or extension management process.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration module with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
