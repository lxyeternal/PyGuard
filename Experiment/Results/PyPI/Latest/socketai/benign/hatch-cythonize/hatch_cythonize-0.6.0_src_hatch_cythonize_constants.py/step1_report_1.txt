{
  "purpose": "Define constants, imports, and data structures related to Cython compilation and platform detection.",
  "sources": "Imported module 'hatch_cythonize.types' and string definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow observed; static configuration definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific types, defines regular expressions, string constants, and sets for file extensions. These are typical configuration and setup code for a build or compilation process. The extension sets are categorizing file types relevant to Cython and C/C++ compilation. No user input, network activity, or data processing that could lead to malicious actions is present. There are no obfuscated patterns or suspicious code flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward configuration module used to specify file extensions and platform constants for a build process. No malicious or security-threatening behaviors are detected.",
