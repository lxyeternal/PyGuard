  "purpose": "Define constants, configurations, and data structures for handling source code, extensions, and platform-specific details in a build or compilation system.",
  "sources": "Constants and variables initialized within the module, such as string patterns, configuration flags, and sets of file extensions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not perform data processing, output, or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly defines static data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets; the code appears to be straightforward configuration setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific types and defines constants and sets related to file extensions and platform identifiers. There is no input/output handling, no dynamic execution, or external interactions. The data structures are static, and no suspicious or malicious code behaviors are present. All patterns are consistent with typical configuration modules used in build systems or compilers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration and constant definition module with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger build or compilation process, not executing any malicious or harmful actions.",
