{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define metadata for a Python package, including copyright, license, and version information.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string literals for version, copyright, and license identifiers.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform any data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present; the code only assigns static values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only metadata declarations; no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal header file specifying SPDX license identifiers, copyright, and version. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, or potentially dangerous operations. The static assignment of version and license information is standard practice in package files. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a metadata header for a Python package. It does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
