  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; no runtime data processing or transfer observed",
  "anomalies": "Presence of SPDX license identifiers and copyright statement, which are standard comments; no unusual code or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code contains only comments, SPDX license identifiers, and a version variable assignment. No executable logic, data input, or data output is present. The license and copyright information are standard for open-source projects. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal metadata header with no executable or malicious content. It is benign and contains no security threats.",
