  "purpose": "Set license information and version number for the package/module.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded license identifiers and version string.",
  "sinks": "None present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data sources present.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only metadata declarations; no anomalies or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code contains SPDX license identifiers and a version string, which are standard metadata for a Python package. There are no input sources, no data flows, and no execution logic that could be exploited. The content is typical boilerplate for open-source projects to specify licensing and versioning information. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to declare licensing and version information. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
