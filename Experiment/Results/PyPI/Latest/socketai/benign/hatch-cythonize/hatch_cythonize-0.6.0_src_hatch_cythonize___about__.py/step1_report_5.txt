  "purpose": "The code defines metadata for a Python package, including copyright, license, and version information.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings for copyright, license, and version at the top of the file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only static metadata without dynamic or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of SPDX license identifiers, copyright notice, and a version string. There are no functions, external inputs, or executable logic present. No signs of malicious activity, code injection, or data leakage. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are evident. This is typical package metadata declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as metadata for a Python package. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
