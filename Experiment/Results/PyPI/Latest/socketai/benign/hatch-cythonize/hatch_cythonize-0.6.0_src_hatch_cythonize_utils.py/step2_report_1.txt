  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code is straightforward utility functions with no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No logical errors or suspicious code identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Risk justification:** The low securityRisk score reflects minimal concern, appropriate for utility code.\n- **Overall:** No issues found; scores align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; utility functions without malicious intent.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No errors or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Risk justification:** No security concerns, scores are appropriate.\n- **Overall:** No issues; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Utility functions with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk justification:** No security risks; scores reflect that.\n- **Overall:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Utility functions, system info, string manipulation.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Risk justification:** No malicious activity; scores are justified.\n- **Overall:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; standard utility functions.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — acceptable.\n- **Risk justification:** Slightly above zero, but justified given the functions are purely local and non-malicious.\n- **Overall:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code contains no malicious activity, network calls, or code injection.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports agree on 0; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All are very low (0 or 0.1). Given the functions are utility in nature, with no external data leaks or dangerous operations, these are appropriate.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The code does not perform any file writing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscation.\n- The memoization and string manipulation are standard practices.\n- The glob pattern parsing is safe and typical.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**The overall security risk is negligible.** The code is a set of benign utility functions used in build or code generation workflows. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (slightly above zero due to the potential for misuse in malicious contexts, but justified as the code is benign)\n\n**Note:** If stricter, the risk could be lowered to 0, but given the conservative approach, 0.1 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
