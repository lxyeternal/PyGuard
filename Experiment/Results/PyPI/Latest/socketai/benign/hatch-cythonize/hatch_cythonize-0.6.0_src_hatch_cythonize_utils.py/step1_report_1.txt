  "purpose": "Utility functions for file timestamp comparison, memoization, platform info retrieval, string options formatting, glob pattern parsing, and autogenerated comment generation for hatch-cythonize.",
  "sources": "Reading file existence and modification times (os.path.exists, os.path.getmtime, os.path.getctime), platform system and machine info (platform.system, platform.machine), input parameters for functions (kwargs, uglob, variant, modifier, keywords).",
  "sinks": "String formatting for options (options_kws, autogenerated), string replacements in parse_user_glob, global data such as platform info and version strings.",
  "flows": "File info and platform info are read as sources, used in functions that generate strings or cache platform info, with data passed into string formatting functions for output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. Functions are straightforward utility routines.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of utility functions for caching platform info, comparing file timestamps, generating formatted strings, parsing glob patterns, and creating comments. It uses memoization to cache system info, and processes input parameters safely. No data flows indicate untrusted input to dangerous sinks, nor are there any suspicious behaviors like network activity, file writing, or code execution. The code appears standard and clean, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard utility functions for build or processing scripts without any malicious behavior. It neither accesses nor transmits sensitive data, nor performs unsafe operations. Overall security risk is negligible.",
