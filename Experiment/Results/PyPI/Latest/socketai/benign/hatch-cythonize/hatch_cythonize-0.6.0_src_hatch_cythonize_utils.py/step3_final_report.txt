  "purpose": "Utility functions for file timestamp comparison, platform info retrieval, string formatting, glob pattern parsing, and autogenerated comment generation.",
  "sources": "Filesystem timestamps, platform.system(), platform.machine(), input parameters, environment variables (indirectly via platform info), string inputs for glob patterns and keywords.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is written or transmitted, no external commands executed, no network activity.",
  "flows": "Filesystem info and platform data are read; string manipulations and pattern replacements are performed; no external data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises utility functions that perform benign operations such as checking file modification times, caching system info, formatting strings, parsing glob patterns, and generating comments. No network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration is present. Memoization is used for efficiency, not for obfuscation. The functions do not handle sensitive data or secrets. The overall behavior is safe, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
