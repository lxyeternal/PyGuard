  "purpose": "This code defines Pydantic models for Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) schemas and includes methods for JSON schema generation and serialization.",
  "sources": "Reads input data via class methods and model validators, especially from 'values' in 'inject_name' method.",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON schema and model data via 'model_dump()' and schema serialization methods.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through model validators and class methods, eventually leading to JSON schema generation and model dumping.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code or obfuscated patterns. Use of dynamic schema cleaning and custom schema generation is standard for complex schema handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements Pydantic models for representing Kubernetes CRD schemas, with methods for custom JSON schema handling, schema cleaning, and dynamic name injection. No untrusted input handling appears insecure; no data leaks or malicious code are evident. The schema cleaning functions process references and properties but do not execute or inject malicious behavior. The 'generate_crd' function simply dumps the model data. No network or system calls, no backdoors, or suspicious side effects are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured schema definition for Kubernetes CRDs, employing Pydantic features appropriately. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or malicious, aside from normal schema processing.",
