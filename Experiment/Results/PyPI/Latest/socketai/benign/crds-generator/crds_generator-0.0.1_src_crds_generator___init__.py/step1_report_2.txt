{
  "purpose": "The code defines Pydantic models for Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs), including schema serialization, validation, and JSON schema generation.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include the 'values' dictionary in 'inject_name' method, and the class attributes/parameters during model instantiation.",
  "sinks": "The code serializes schemas and injects 'name' into 'metadata', but does not perform any data leakage, external network access, or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into model validation and 'inject_name' method, which modifies 'metadata'. The schema serialization involves recursive cleaning and custom JSON schema generation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The 'cleaning' function modifies schemas but does not introduce malicious behavior. Use of 'handler.resolve_ref_schema' is standard for schema references.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs and serializes Kubernetes CRD schemas using Pydantic. It performs schema cleanup, adds custom JSON schema handling, and dynamically sets the 'metadata.name'. There are no signs of malicious intent such as network operations, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The recursive cleaning of schemas is typical for schema processing, and no suspicious code obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a schema and model definition for Kubernetes CRDs, with standard practices for schema handling and validation. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. It appears safe and intended for schema generation and validation purposes.",
