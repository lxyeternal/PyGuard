{
  "purpose": "This code defines Pydantic models for Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs), including schema handling and JSON schema generation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from model inputs such as 'metadata', 'spec', 'names', and 'versions' when creating or serializing CRD objects.",
  "sinks": "Data serialization functions (model_dump) and schema cleaning functions could potentially process untrusted data if inputs are not validated, but there are no external sinks like network connections or file writes.",
  "flows": "Input data -> Model instantiation -> Schema processing (cleaning, serialization) -> Output dump",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Custom functions and schema cleaning are standard for Pydantic-based schema manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code models Kubernetes CRDs with Pydantic, providing custom JSON schema serialization and validation. The cleaning function recursively removes 'title' and resolves references in schemas, which is typical schema processing. The injection of 'metadata' name based on 'spec' fields is straightforward. There are no dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious data leaks. The code appears purely for schema modeling and serialization, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a schema modeling utility for Kubernetes CRDs with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs standard schema handling and model serialization without external effects or unsafe practices.",
