{
  "purpose": "Define and serialize Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) schemas using Pydantic models with custom JSON schema generation.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are primarily from class attributes, method parameters, and class method calls such as model_json_schema and model_dump.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data to external systems, executes untrusted input, or performs network operations.",
  "flows": "Class attributes and method calls generate JSON schemas from Pydantic models, with schema cleaning and serialization involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, unusual dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. The cleaning function recursively processes schema references but does not manipulate data maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The code defines Pydantic models for Kubernetes CRD schema representation, including custom JSON schema handling. It uses class methods and validators to generate schema representations, with a recursive cleaning function for JSON schemas. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be intended for schema generation and validation, not for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a schema definition and serialization utility for Kubernetes CRDs using Pydantic. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe and purpose-driven, with no suspicious or malicious signals detected.",
