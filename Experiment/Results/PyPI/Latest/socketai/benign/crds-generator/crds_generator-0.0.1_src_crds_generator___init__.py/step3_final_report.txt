  "purpose": "Defines Pydantic models for Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs), including schema serialization, cleaning, and dynamic name injection.",
  "sources": "Schema definitions, schema reference resolution, and name injection functions within the models.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; schema processing is internal and standard.",
  "flows": "Schema reference resolution and recursive cleaning functions process schema data; name injection modifies metadata based on spec fields.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; recursive schema cleaning is standard; no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard practices for schema modeling and validation using Pydantic, with custom JSON schema generation and recursive cleaning. No external network calls, data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The name injection method is straightforward. The recursive cleaning function handles schema references safely. Overall, the code is well-structured, purpose-driven, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for Kubernetes CRD schema management, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The minimal security risk score reflects the benign nature of schema processing, which is inherently safe.",
