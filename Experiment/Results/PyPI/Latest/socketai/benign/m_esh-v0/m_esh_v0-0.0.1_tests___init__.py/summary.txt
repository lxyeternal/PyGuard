  "conclusion": "The code appears benign but contains insecure practices that elevate the security risk. The malware score remains at 0. The security risk score should be adjusted from 0.4 to 0.6 to reflect the potential exploitation vector. The overall assessment remains low risk, with no malicious activity detected."
