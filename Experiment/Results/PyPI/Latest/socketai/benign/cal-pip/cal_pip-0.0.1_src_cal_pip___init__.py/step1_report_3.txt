  "purpose": "The code imports functions or variables 'add' from a local module 'val' and 'version' from a local module 'version'.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; purely import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements from local modules, which is typical for organizing Python packages. No input handling, no data processing, no network connections, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be standard module import syntax with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports components from local modules, which is standard practice.",
