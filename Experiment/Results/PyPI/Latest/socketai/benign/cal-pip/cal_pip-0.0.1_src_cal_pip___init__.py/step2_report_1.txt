  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the original code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Original Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom .val import add\nfrom .version import version\n```\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Describes standard local imports.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; the code only imports from local modules.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing internal dependencies.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; straightforward import statements.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** The securityRisk is set to 0.1 despite no evident risk. This might be overly cautious but not unreasonable given the minimal code. Since no external data or code execution is involved, a lower risk score (e.g., 0) could be justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Reiterates standard internal imports.\n- **Analysis:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same as previous.\n- **Analysis:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence, but still consistent.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is only importing local modules with no malicious behavior.\n- The malware score is zero across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is zero, as the code is straightforward.\n- The securityRisk score is mostly zero, except in Report 2, where it is 0.1. Given the code's simplicity, this seems overly cautious.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Confirmed as 0; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; code is clear.\n- **Security risk score:** Should be 0 for all reports, as there are no vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The scores are generally consistent with the code.\n- The only point of contention is the securityRisk in Report 2, which could be lowered to 0.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate, reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimates:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0** | **0** | **0** |\n\n**Rationale:** The code is standard import statements with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet. The scoring should reflect zero risk and no malicious activity.",
