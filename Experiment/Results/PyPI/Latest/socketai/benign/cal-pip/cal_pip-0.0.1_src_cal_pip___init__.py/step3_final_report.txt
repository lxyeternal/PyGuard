{
  "purpose": "The code performs internal module imports from local files, likely for dependency management within a package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .val and .version modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from external sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code contains two relative import statements from local modules, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or external data handling. It is a minimal, standard pattern for internal dependencies. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate. The slight variation in confidence levels (0.9 vs 1) does not impact the benign assessment. Overall, the code is safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
