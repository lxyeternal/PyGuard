{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions or variables named 'add' and 'version' from local modules 'val' and 'version', respectively, likely for use within a larger package or application.",
  "sources": "Import statements retrieving 'add' from '.val' and 'version' from '.version'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only performs imports without processing untrusted input or executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code is only importing internal modules.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscated code present. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative import statements to include components from local modules. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of sensitive data. The minimal structure indicates typical package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to import internal components. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
