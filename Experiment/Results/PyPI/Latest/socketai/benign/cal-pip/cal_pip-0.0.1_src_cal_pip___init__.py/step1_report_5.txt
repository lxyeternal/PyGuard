{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing functions or variables from internal modules, likely for use within a larger package.",
  "sources": "Imports from .val and .version modules",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or output points are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks within this snippet; imports are static and internal",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are evident",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'add' from a local module '.val' and 'version' from '.version'. These are internal imports typical for Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or external data handling. The code is minimal, only establishing internal dependencies, with no active execution, network activity, or data processing shown.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a standard internal import pattern with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for a Python package structure.",
