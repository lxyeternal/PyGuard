{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions or variables from local modules 'val' and 'version', likely for internal use within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.val' and '.version' modules, which are local dependencies within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted input or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident; the imports suggest internal dependency usage rather than data processing from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific components from local modules, which is typical in Python projects. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, external network calls, or data exfiltration, are present. The structure and syntax are standard. Since it only performs import statements from internal modules, it does not pose security risks or contain malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign part of a larger project, performing standard internal imports without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
