  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules (`.val` and `.version`).\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected.\n- The code is standard Python module import syntax, typical for package setup or internal dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues in the code:\n- The original code snippet is just:\n```python\nfrom .val import add\nfrom .version import version\n```\n- **No issues are present** in the code itself. It is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n**Reports 1-5** all agree on the benign nature of this code, emphasizing its simplicity and internal dependency role.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- No factual errors or logical flaws are evident.\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is standard import syntax with no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores assigned:**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0` and `securityRisk: 0` (or very close, e.g., 0.1 in report 2). These are reasonable given the code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate.\n- Confidence scores are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- The only minor point is report 2 assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1 despite no suspicious activity. This seems slightly overcautious but not unreasonable given the context. It could be adjusted to 0 for consistency.\n- Report 5 has a confidence of 0.9; perhaps it could be 1, but this is minor.\n\n---\n\n### Risk scores justification:\n- Since the code only performs internal imports, **risk is minimal**.\n- No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Clearly, the malware score should be **0** for all reports, as there is no malicious activity.\n\n### Obfuscated:\n- Obfuscation is absent; scores of 0 are correct.\n\n### Overall risk:\n- The overall security risk is negligible; scores of 0 or very close are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is benign.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are reasonable, with minor room for uniformity.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security concern)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard internal import statement with no malicious or risky behavior. The existing reports and scores are appropriate, with only slight room for minor adjustments in confidence or risk levels.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately.
