{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a version string, likely for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The only source is the assignment of the string '0.0.1' to the variable 'version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present beyond variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a version declaration with no additional logic, input handling, or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, defining a version string without any functional or malicious components. It does not include any input reading, data processing, or external communications. There are no suspicious constructs, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code patterns. Given its simplicity, it appears to serve a standard purpose of versioning information. No anomalies or malicious behavior are detected in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, simply specifying a version number with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
