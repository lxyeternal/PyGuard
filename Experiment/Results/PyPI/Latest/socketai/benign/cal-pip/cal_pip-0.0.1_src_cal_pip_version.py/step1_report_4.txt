{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a version string for a Python package or module, likely used for version control or package management.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are read in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as the code only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not contain any unusual language features or obfuscated constructs. No secrets or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string '0.0.1' to a variable named 'version'. This is a common practice in Python packages for version tracking. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal nature of the code indicates it serves a straightforward purpose without any complex behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is benign and typical for Python package versioning.",
