  "purpose": "The code only specifies a version string '0.0.1' and provides no additional functionality or logic.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or external calls.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code contains only a version declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any operational code, logic, or data handling; no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment consists solely of a version string assignment with no executable code, input/output, or external interactions. It presents no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. Given the minimal content, there's no evidence of data leaks, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is harmless, containing only a version string declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. It is likely part of a larger package but by itself poses no security risks.",
