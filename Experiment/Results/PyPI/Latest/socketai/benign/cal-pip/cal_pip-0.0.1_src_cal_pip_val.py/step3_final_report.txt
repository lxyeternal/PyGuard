  "purpose": "A simple addition function performing no external operations or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'a' and 'b' as input data.",
  "sinks": "Return statement output; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow directly into the addition operation and the return statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward addition function with no external dependencies, input validation, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no anomalies or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature. No issues or risks are present, and the code does not perform any malicious actions or contain hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, simple addition function with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
