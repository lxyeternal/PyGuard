  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Findings from Reports:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as a standard, benign `setup.py` script used for packaging a Python project.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected: no code injections, network activity, dynamic execution, or data leaks.\n- The only noteworthy aspect is reading `README.md` for `long_description`, which is common practice but could be exploited if the file content is maliciously altered—though this is a standard pattern.\n- The author fields are placeholders, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, with high confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is exactly as described: a typical `setup.py` script. No anomalies, no obfuscation, no suspicious code.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected. The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only minor concern is reading `README.md`, which is standard and unlikely to be malicious unless the file itself is compromised. There are no indications of this in the reports.\n- **Author info:** Placeholders are used, which is typical for template or placeholder packages. Not inherently malicious.\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports seem reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only minor point is the reading of a local file, which is common practice and not suspicious. The placeholder author info is typical for template packages.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify this as a safe, non-malicious setup script. The scores are appropriate, and there are no indications of supply chain or malware issues.",
