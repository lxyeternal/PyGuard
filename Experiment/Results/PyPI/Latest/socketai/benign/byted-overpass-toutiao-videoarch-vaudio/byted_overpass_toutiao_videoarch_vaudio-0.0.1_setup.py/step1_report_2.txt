  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration script for packaging a Python library, primarily for defining package metadata and setup parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file content for long_description, package discovery via find_packages(), static metadata fields (name, version, author, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; the script does not perform any network or file operations beyond reading a file at setup time.",
  "flows": "Reads external 'README.md' -> uses static metadata and finds packages -> supplies data to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; uses standard setup pattern. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file to populate the long_description and defines package metadata. The code contains no dynamic execution, network activity, or input handling that could indicate malicious intent. It appears to be a placeholder package designed to mitigate dependency confusion risks, as described in the description field. There are no anomalies, suspicious functions, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a placeholder package intended for dependency management. No malicious activity or security threats are present.",
