{
  "purpose": "The code imports two modules, 'stock_quant_history_snapshot' and 'stock_quant_history', likely for data processing or analysis related to stock quantities.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the current package/directory",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; no data handling or untrusted data processing is shown",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this code snippet as it only performs imports",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements from the current package, indicating the inclusion of local modules. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues. Since only imports are shown, it lacks any behavior that could be malicious or suspicious. No external data sources, sinks, or flows are visible, and the structure is typical for Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports two modules, likely for further processing elsewhere.",
