  "purpose": "The code imports modules related to stock quantity history snapshots and stock quantity history, likely for data processing or analysis within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the same package, indicating these modules are sources of data or functionality.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process or output data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible within this snippet; imports do not establish data flow paths themselves.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of import statements with no additional logic, which is typical for module setup. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only two import statements from relative modules, which is standard for organizing a Python package. No obfuscated code, malicious code, or security-sensitive operations are present. Without further context, these imports appear to be part of a normal package structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of module imports. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from these lines.",
