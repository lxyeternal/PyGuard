  "purpose": "This code performs relative imports of two modules within a package, likely related to stock data management.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the current package: 'stock_quant_history_snapshot' and 'stock_quant_history'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only imports modules without data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Import statements serve as source points; no data flows or execution paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two relative import statements, which are standard in Python packages. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores. Given the simplicity and clarity, there is no indication of malicious intent or security issues. The scores are consistent with the code's straightforward structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current reports and scores are appropriate and do not require adjustments.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
