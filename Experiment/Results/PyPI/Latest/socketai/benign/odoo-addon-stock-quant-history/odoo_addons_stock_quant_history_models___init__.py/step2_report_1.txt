  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code consists solely of two import statements from local modules: `stock_quant_history_snapshot` and `stock_quant_history`. There are no data flows, no execution logic, no external data sources, or sinks. The code is minimal and typical for a Python package setup.\n\n2. **Malicious Activity and Obfuscation**:  \n   - No reports identify any obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, indicating no malicious intent detected.\n   - The code does not contain any signs of malware, such as obfuscated code, suspicious module names, or embedded payloads.\n\n3. **Security Risks**:  \n   - The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), consistent with benign import statements.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or other vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n4. **Score Justification and Consistency**:  \n   - The scores for malware are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The security risk scores are appropriately low, given the simplicity of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns**:  \n   - Since the code only performs imports, there is no immediate security concern.\n   - However, in a broader context, if these modules are malicious or compromised, that could pose a risk, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence.\n\n**Summary and Recommendations**:\n\n- **Overall Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering minimal package import concerns, but 0 is justified here)\n\n**Final Justification**:  \nThe code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The import statements are standard and do not pose security risks in isolation.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe current report scores are appropriate given the minimal and benign nature of the code snippet. No changes are necessary.",
