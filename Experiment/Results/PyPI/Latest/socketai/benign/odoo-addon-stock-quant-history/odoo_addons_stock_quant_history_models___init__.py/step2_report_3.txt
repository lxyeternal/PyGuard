  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content**:\n```python\nfrom . import stock_quant_history_snapshot\nfrom . import stock_quant_history\n```\nThis code performs only two relative import statements from the current package. It contains no logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports**:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and typical for Python modules.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The reports assign very low confidence scores for malware and security risks, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- The malware score is consistently zero, indicating no malicious behavior is suspected.\n- The obfuscated score is zero, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n- The security risk scores are minimal, reflecting the absence of any evident vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Logical Consistency and Score Justification**:\n- The high confidence (mostly 1 or 0.9) that this code is benign is justified.\n- Since the code only imports modules, there's no reason to suspect malicious intent.\n- The absence of data flows, sinks, or any operational logic supports a zero malware score.\n- The minimal security risk score (mostly 0 or 0.1) is appropriate, given the lack of any suspicious activity.\n\n4. **Potential for Misinterpretation**:\n- Import statements alone are unlikely to be malicious unless combined with malicious modules or obfuscated code, which is not the case here.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted based solely on these import statements.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation**:\n- The scores assigned in each report are reasonable and consistent with the code snippet.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the scores reflect the benign nature of the code accurately.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (correct)\n\n### Additional note:\nGiven the simplicity of the code, the overall assessment is that this snippet is entirely benign and poses no security risk.\n\n**Summary**: The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or suspicion is warranted based on this code snippet.",
