{
  "purpose": "Static manifest/configuration data for an Odoo module, defining metadata such as name, version, author, dependencies, and data files.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from static strings and file references within the module manifest.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data outputs; the code does not process or output data dynamically.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code is purely declarative metadata without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static JSON-like dictionary defining module metadata. It contains no executable logic, user input handling, network activity, or dynamic data processing. All references are to configuration files and URLs typical for an Odoo module. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1). No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Odoo module manifest with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and the reasoning is sound. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
