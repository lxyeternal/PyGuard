  "purpose": "Define metadata and configuration for the 'Stock Quant History' module in an Odoo application.",
  "sources": "Static JSON object containing module metadata, dependencies, and data file references.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the code mainly defines static configuration and metadata.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is static configuration data without dynamic input/output flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. The code contains only standard module metadata and references.",
  "analysis": "The code provides module metadata including name, version, author, license, dependencies, maintainers, and data files. It does not include any executable logic, user input handling, or network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data leakage, or backdoors. The references are to configuration files and documentation URLs. The authors' email and project URLs are standard and publicly known. Overall, the code is a typical module manifest for an Odoo module with no apparent security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module manifest for an Odoo application with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
