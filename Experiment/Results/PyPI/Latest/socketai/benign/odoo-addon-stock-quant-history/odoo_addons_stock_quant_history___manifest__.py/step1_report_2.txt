  "sources": "Hardcoded strings including author, license, website, dependencies, and data file paths",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; the code is static configuration",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as this is purely configuration metadata",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected; only standard module metadata",
  "analysis": "The code provides static metadata about an Odoo module, including author, license, version, dependencies, data files, and maintainers. All data appears to be hardcoded configuration details with no user input, external data processing, or dynamic execution. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident, and no security risks or malware signals are present in this static configuration snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration file defining an Odoo module. There are no indications of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.",
