  "purpose": "Import the 'models' module from the current package, likely for use in a larger application or framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current package's 'models' module when executed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present in this single line of code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are observable from this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a simple relative import of the 'models' module. It is a common pattern in Python packages and does not include any dynamic execution, obfuscated elements, or suspicious behavior. Since this is only a single import statement, there are no evident security concerns or malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a normal part of Python package structure.",
