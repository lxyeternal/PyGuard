  "purpose": "This code performs a relative import of the 'models' module within the current package, likely as part of a larger package structure.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is the source; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as network operations, data leaks, or external data handling in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the import simply makes the 'models' module available within the package namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import statement with no dynamic execution, external inputs, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code does not perform any network activity, data handling, or contain hidden backdoors. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no security risks or malicious intent. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent. No further action or concern is warranted.",
