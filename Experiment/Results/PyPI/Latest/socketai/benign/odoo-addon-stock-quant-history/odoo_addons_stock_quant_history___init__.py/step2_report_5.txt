  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports describe a single import statement: `from . import models`. This is a standard relative import in Python, referencing a local module named 'models'. There are no signs of code execution, data handling, or external inputs/outputs. Therefore, **no issues are present** in the code snippet itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are highly consistent and accurate in their assessment: they correctly identify the code as a simple import statement with no suspicious features.  \n- They correctly note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.  \n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.  \n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the minimal and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.  \n- These are reasonable, considering the code's simplicity.  \n- No adjustments are necessary based on the evidence.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n- The reports all assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which aligns with the minimal code.  \n- No reason exists to assign a higher score, as there's no indication of vulnerability or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n- All reports correctly assign `malware: 0`.  \n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, so this score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they only describe the code's apparent purpose and characteristics.  \n- No speculative vulnerabilities or threats are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is benign and presents no security concerns.**  \nThe reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward relative import statement with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are correct, and the reasoning is sound.",
