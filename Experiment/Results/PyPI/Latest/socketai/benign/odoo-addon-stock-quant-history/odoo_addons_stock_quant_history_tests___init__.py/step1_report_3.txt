  "purpose": "Import a module named test_stock_quant_history from the current package",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data or code from the current package/module",
  "sinks": "The import statement itself does not contain any sink where untrusted data could cause harm",
  "flows": "Data flows from the current package into the namespace via import, but no untrusted data is involved",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named test_stock_quant_history from the current package. It is a standard import statement with no parameters or dynamic execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The module name suggests it may relate to stock data history, but the import alone does not indicate any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is a typical module import that does not raise concerns.",
