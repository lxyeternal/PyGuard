  "flows": "No data flows are evident since the code only performs an import statement and does not process data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns. Import statement is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from the current package. It does not include any execution logic, data handling, or suspicious behavior. No external inputs or outputs are present, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are detected. The code appears to be a typical module import, possibly for testing or functionality inclusion.",
