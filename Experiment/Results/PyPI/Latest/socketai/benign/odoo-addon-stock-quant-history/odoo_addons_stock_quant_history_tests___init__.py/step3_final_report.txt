{
  "purpose": "The code imports a local module named 'test_stock_quant_history' within the same package, likely for use within the current module or package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs are present in this snippet; it is a simple import.",
  "flows": "The code imports the module 'test_stock_quant_history' into the current namespace; no data flow or execution flow beyond this import occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected. The import is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal relative import statement, which is a common pattern in Python packages. It does not contain any embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this import. Since the import alone does not execute code or handle untrusted data, there are no security risks or malware indicators. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Without inspecting the contents of 'test_stock_quant_history', we cannot assess potential malicious behavior within that module, but based solely on this import statement, the code is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign, standard import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The reports accurately reflect this, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
