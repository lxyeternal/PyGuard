  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal import statement: `from . import test_stock_quant_history` or similar.\n- No code execution, data flow, or external communication is present.\n- The module name suggests it relates to stock data history, but that alone does not imply malicious intent.\n- The reports consistently assign very low risk, malware, and obfuscation scores, which aligns with the benign nature of such an import statement.\n\n**Confirmations and issues:**\n- The import statement itself is straightforward and benign.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code does not act as a source or sink of untrusted data.\n- The only potential concern could be if the imported module itself is malicious, but that cannot be determined from this snippet alone. The reports do not attempt to evaluate the content of `test_stock_quant_history`, only the import statement.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the minimal import.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, also appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is consistent with benign code.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty about benignity based on the import statement alone.\n\n**Critical points:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the import statement is benign.\n- They acknowledge that maliciousness could only be assessed by examining the imported module, which is outside the scope here.\n- No report overstates or underestimates the risk; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n- The code snippet is a standard, benign import statement.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence scores are appropriate.\n- The overall security assessment aligns with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The import statement is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No adjustments are necessary.",
