  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple import statement:\n     ```python\n     from . import test_stock_quant_history\n     ```\n   - There are no signs of embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior in this line.\n   - The code is benign and standard for modular Python projects.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify that the import statement alone does not indicate malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The confidence levels are high, especially in reports 3, 4, and 5.\n\n3. **Scores Review and Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** All are 0 or very close (0.1 in report 2), which is reasonable since an import statement by itself does not pose security risks.\n   - **Security Risk:** Also low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Malicious Behavior or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports mention that if the module `test_stock_quant_history` were malicious, it could pose a risk, but the import statement alone does not confirm this.\n   - No assumptions are made beyond what the code shows.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores align well with the analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Without inspecting the contents of `test_stock_quant_history`, we cannot definitively rule out malicious behavior within that module.\n   - However, based solely on this import statement, the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (importing a local module is not risky by itself)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code snippet is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If future analysis includes the content of `test_stock_quant_history`, that could alter the risk assessment, but based solely on this import line, the code is benign.",
