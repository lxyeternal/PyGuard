  "purpose": "Defines a stock quant history model for inventory tracking in Odoo, capturing snapshot, product, location, lot, and quantity details.",
  "sources": "Related fields (snapshot_id.inventory_date, product_id.product_tmpl_id, product_id.uom_id, location_id.company_id), and standard ORM relations.",
  "sinks": "Potential exposure through related fields, but no untrusted input or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Related fields derive data from other models; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard ORM usage and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured Odoo model defining stock history with standard fields and relations. It contains no dynamic code, external calls, or obfuscation. The related fields are standard in Odoo but could theoretically expose related data if misused, though this is not a security flaw. No malicious or suspicious code is present. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting standard data exposure but no inherent vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard inventory data model with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and the security risk is minimal. No further action needed.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
