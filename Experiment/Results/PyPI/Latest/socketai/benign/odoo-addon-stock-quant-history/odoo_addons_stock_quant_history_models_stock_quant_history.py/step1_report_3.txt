{
  "purpose": "Define a model for tracking the history of stock quants in an inventory system within Odoo.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input; fields are standard model definitions. No external input processing observed.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; standard ORM field relations and data storage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. All code consists of model and field definitions with no dynamic execution or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Odoo model with multiple relational fields referencing other models. All fields are standard ORM fields with appropriate ondelete behaviors, read-only settings, and metadata. No user input handling or external data processing is present. The code appears to be straightforward data model declaration with no apparent malicious or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Odoo model definition for stock history tracking, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
