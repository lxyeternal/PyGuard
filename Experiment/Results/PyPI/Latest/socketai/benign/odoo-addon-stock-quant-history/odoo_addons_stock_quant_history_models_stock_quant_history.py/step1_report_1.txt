  "purpose": "Define an Odoo model for tracking stock quant history, including fields for snapshot settings, product info, location, and quantity.",
  "sources": "Data read from related fields (snapshot_id, product_id, location_id, etc.), and model metadata.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data is written to external systems or output streams within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from related fields (snapshot_id, product_id, location_id) to dependent fields, primarily for display and data integrity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected. The only potential concern is the use of 'related' fields, which is standard for Odoo models but could potentially expose related data if misused, though this is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Odoo model with fields that establish relationships between stock quants, products, locations, and snapshots. The fields include 'Many2one' relationships with ondelete behaviors, read-only flags, indexing, and help descriptions, all of which are typical for data models. No external data fetching, network operations, or insecure coding practices are present. The structure is straightforward, adhering to standard Odoo development practices, and does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign data model definition for stock history within an Odoo module. No malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks are evident. It is a normal part of an inventory management system implementation.",
