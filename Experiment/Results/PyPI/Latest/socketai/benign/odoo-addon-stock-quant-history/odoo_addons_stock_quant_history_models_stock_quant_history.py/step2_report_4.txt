  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward Odoo model definition for stock quant history.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.\n- The code uses standard ORM fields, relations, and metadata.\n- No external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The security risk scores assigned are low (0.1 to 0.2), which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and aligns with standard Odoo practices.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is justified.\n- **Security risk:** The assigned scores are very low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- The first report assigns a **securityRisk** of 0.2, slightly higher than others, but given the code's nature, this is acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n- The overall **malware** scores are 0 across all reports, which matches the code content.\n\n### Logic flaws or reasoning errors:\n- No flawed reasoning or assumptions are evident. All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The reports do not overstate or understate the risk; scores seem reasonable.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which is reasonable given the benign nature but acknowledging that it's part of a system that could, in theory, be misused if misconfigured.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, safe Odoo data model with no malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided reports.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard data model, minimal security concern)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes necessary.",
