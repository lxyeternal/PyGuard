{
  "purpose": "Define a model for stock quants history in Odoo, capturing snapshots of stock levels with related fields.",
  "sources": "Fields accessing related data (e.g., snapshot_id.inventory_date, product_id.product_tmpl_id, location_id.company_id), and input parameters in field definitions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive fields that could expose data (e.g., company_id, location_id, product_id), but these are standard relational fields.",
  "flows": "Data flows from related fields (snapshot_id, product_id, location_id) into the model's stored fields; no untrusted external input flows directly into critical sink points.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution present. The code uses standard Odoo model and field definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Odoo model with fields linking to other models and related data. All fields are standard ORM definitions with no dynamic code execution, input handling beyond model relationships, or data manipulation. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The licensing and author comments are standard. The model's purpose aligns with stock management functionalities without any suspicious logic or hidden mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward Odoo model definition for stock quants history, with no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It is standard, well-structured, and contains no anomalous or malicious code.",
