  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for stock quant history management in Odoo. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of raw SQL for cleanup and elevated privileges is typical and does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal."
