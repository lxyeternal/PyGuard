  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'django-storage' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Import statement for setuptools; parameters in setup() function such as name, version, author, author_email, description, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external output of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields, which could be placeholders; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with basic package metadata. The package appears to be a placeholder with minimal information, and no suspicious or malicious code, external network activity, or obfuscated elements are present. The absence of dangerous operations and lack of external data handling suggest no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve as a placeholder or minimal package setup.",
