  "purpose": "A PyQt6 widget for managing tags/chips with add, remove, and update functionalities, emitting signals on changes.",
  "sources": "User input from QLineEdit, signals from combo boxes and buttons, external utility functions for data handling.",
  "sinks": "Signal emission of updated list, widget updates for chips and selections.",
  "flows": "Input from QLineEdit or selection widgets -> add/remove/update methods -> signal emission -> UI updates with chips and selection states.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. Regex for weight parsing is benign. External modules are assumed safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard GUI component managing tags, with typical signal-slot patterns, user input handling, and external utility usage. No external network activity, code injection, or obfuscation detected. The regex used is benign, and the code structure is straightforward. External dependencies are not provided but appear safe. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code's purpose is purely UI management, with no external system modifications or risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured GUI widget for tag management, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero. The scores provided in the reports are justified and consistent with the code's content.",
