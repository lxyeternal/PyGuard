  "purpose": "Utility function to retrieve and sanitize data from a QListWidgetItem object in a PyQt6 application.",
  "sources": "Reads data from QListWidgetItem via item.data() and item.text() methods.",
  "sinks": "Returns a sanitized string; no untrusted data is sent elsewhere or exposed.",
  "flows": "Input from QListWidgetItem (via data() or text()) is processed and returned after stripping whitespace.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply retrieves data associated with a list widget item, prioritizing custom data role, then default text. It applies strip() for sanitization. No external data sources, network operations, or suspicious behavior observed. The imported modules are standard for PyQt6 and project-specific constants. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward data retrieval and cleaning operation. It does not contain malware, suspicious behaviors, or security vulnerabilities based on the provided snippet.",
