  "purpose": "The function retrieves and processes data from a QListWidgetItem, returning a cleaned string value.",
  "sources": "The data() method of QListWidgetItem with a role from consts.LIST_ITEM_ROLE, and the text() method of QListWidgetItem.",
  "sinks": "The returned value is used elsewhere, potentially in UI display or data processing, but no direct sink is visible within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data from item.data(consts.LIST_ITEM_ROLE) or item.text() flows through the value variable and is returned after stripping whitespace.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a QListWidgetItem class and a constants module, then defines a simple function that retrieves data from a QListWidgetItem. It checks for data associated with a specific role and falls back to the text if none is found. It then strips whitespace before returning. The logic appears straightforward and typical for UI data handling. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are detected, no external inputs, or unsafe data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function for extracting and cleaning data from a GUI list item. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
