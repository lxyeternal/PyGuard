  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided code snippets and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Use of eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, network activity, input handling, code obfuscation indicators.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data execution via eval/exec, network connections for data exfiltration, hardcoded credentials or URLs, potential backdoors.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., eval, unvalidated data) leading to code execution, network sinks for data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets used during runtime.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted data, hardcoded secrets and URLs, obfuscated or complex control flow, lack of input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and malicious intent, especially with eval/exec usage, hardcoded secrets, and network activity. Reports 4 and 5 show high suspicion with multiple malicious indicators, justifying high malware and risk scores. Reports 1 and 2 are more benign or lack code, with scores reflecting low suspicion. Report 3 confirms benign patterns. Adjustments to report 5's obfuscation (to 0.6) and malware (to 0.7) scores are justified given the suspicious patterns. Overall, the scores are consistent with the described behaviors, indicating moderate to high security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows potential malicious activity, especially in reports highlighting eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, and network activity. Scores are generally appropriate; minor adjustments improve accuracy. Overall, the package warrants caution due to signs of obfuscation and malicious indicators.",
