  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, its primary purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data can be read from environment variables, file reads, or network requests (if present). Since no specific code provided, assume environment variables and file I/O as common sources.",
  "sinks": "Data can be sent over the network, written to files, or used in subprocesses. Potential sinks include network sockets, subprocess calls, or file writes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or files to sinks like network transmissions, file outputs, or command executions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are visible in the provided code fragment. Lack of obfuscation or unusual language features is noted.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed step-by-step. No signs of malicious behavior such as system backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity are detected. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No signs of code injection, unsafe SQL, or random number misuse were found. There are no indicators of obfuscation or malicious payloads. Due to the absence of suspicious patterns, the code seems benign. However, limited context and lack of detailed code snippets restrict a definitive assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to perform legitimate functions without evident malicious behavior.",
