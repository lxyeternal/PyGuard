{
  "purpose": "The code implements custom Qt widget classes and utility functions for user interface interactions, specifically clickable labels and integer input fields.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user keypress events and text input from the user via QLineEdit.",
  "targets": "The code processes user input to update internal state and emit signals; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "User input (key events) → event filter logic → value parsing and updating signals; text changes → emit valueChanged signal.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard Qt event handling and regex validation without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a label class with a click signal, a key validation function, and a custom spin box class that restricts input to numeric characters and control keys. All functions and classes follow typical UI patterns. No external network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The input validation via regex is straightforward and safe. No malicious or sabotage code is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of Qt UI components for numeric input and clickable labels. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified.",
