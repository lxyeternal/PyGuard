  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. The minor logical concern does not elevate the security risk. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate, though a risk score of 0.05 could be considered for precision. Overall, the code is safe and standard."
