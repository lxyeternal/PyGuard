{
  "purpose": "Defines custom Qt widgets and utility functions for handling numeric input and clickable labels within a PyQt6 application.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from QLineEdit, processes key events, and emits signals based on interactions.",
  "sinks": "Emits signals based on user interactions; no evident sinks that lead to data leakage or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "User input → eventFilter or textChanged → signal emission; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code primarily manages UI input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a custom label class with a click event and a numeric input box with validation. The regex pattern ensures only valid integer strings are accepted. The event filter filters out invalid key presses. There are no external data transmissions, code injections, or suspicious behaviors. Usage of signals and Qt event handling is standard and appropriate. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate UI component code for numeric input handling and clickable labels. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious data flows, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe and intended for user input validation within a PyQt6 application.",
