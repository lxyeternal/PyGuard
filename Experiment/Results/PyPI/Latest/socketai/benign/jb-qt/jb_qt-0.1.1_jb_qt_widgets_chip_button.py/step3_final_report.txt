  "purpose": "A PyQt6 widget for managing tags, allowing editing, removal, and optional weight assignment.",
  "sources": "User input via QLineEdit, callback functions on_update and on_remove, tag string parameter.",
  "sinks": "Callback functions invoked during tag updates/removals, dialog for weight input, UI event handlers.",
  "flows": "User interacts with label or buttons -> triggers toggle_edit_mode or apply_weight -> emits update via callbacks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious network activity, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward PyQt6 widget implementing tag management with editing and removal features. It uses standard UI components and callback mechanisms without any network calls, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns. Event filtering handles key presses for editing, and dialogs facilitate weight input. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's structure and logic are clear and typical for such UI components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured PyQt6 widget for tag management with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), consistent with its UI-focused nature.",
