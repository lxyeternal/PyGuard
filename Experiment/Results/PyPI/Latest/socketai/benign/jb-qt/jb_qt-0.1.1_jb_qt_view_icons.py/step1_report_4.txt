{
  "purpose": "A GUI tool for displaying and searching icons from various sources (system themes, Qt icons, standard icons).",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for configuration; os.walk for reading icon files from theme directories; user input from QLineEdit for search filtering.",
  "sinks": "Clipboard set operation in copy_icon_name_to_clipboard; display of toast messages.",
  "flows": "User inputs search term -> update_display filters icons -> user clicks icon -> copy_icon_name_to_clipboard copies icon name to clipboard and shows toast.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for copying actions, but no suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; no network, reverse shells, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard PyQt6-based icon browser with fuzzy search capabilities. It reads icon files from system theme directories and Qt theme icons, and displays them in a grid. The code handles user input to filter icons via fuzzy matching, and allows copying icon names to clipboard with optional quotes. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious behavior detected. The functions are straightforward, with no obfuscated or misleading code structures. The only notable operation is copying to clipboard and displaying toast notifications, which are typical UI features. There are no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The code's use of standard libraries and clear logic suggests low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured GUI icon browser tool without any malicious behavior or security risks. It solely interacts with local files, user input, and system clipboard. No malicious code or sabotage present.",
