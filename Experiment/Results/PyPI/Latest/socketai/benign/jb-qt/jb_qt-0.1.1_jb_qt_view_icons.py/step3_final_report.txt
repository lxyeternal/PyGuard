  "purpose": "A Python GUI application for browsing, searching, and copying icon names from system themes or Qt libraries, utilizing user input, command-line args, and filesystem access.",
  "sources": "User input via search bar, command-line arguments, filesystem traversal for icons, environment variables for theme info.",
  "sinks": "Clipboard for copying icon names, GUI display for icons, print statements for logs, toast notifications for user feedback.",
  "flows": "Search input → fuzzy matching against icon list → display icons in table → user clicks icon → icon name copied to clipboard with optional quotes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected. Filesystem access is standard for icon browsing tools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward icon browser with search and copy features, using benign external libraries and standard GUI components. No malicious behaviors such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The filesystem access for icon retrieval is typical and does not indicate malicious intent. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. External dependencies are standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is a benign, well-structured GUI tool for icon browsing. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
