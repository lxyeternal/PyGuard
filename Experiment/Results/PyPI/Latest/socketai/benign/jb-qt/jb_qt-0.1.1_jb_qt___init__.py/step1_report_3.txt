  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a placeholder or an empty script with no specific functionality or operations performed.",
  "sources": "The code does not read input, environment variables, network data, or files.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only an empty or whitespace script with no logic, which is unusual if part of a package but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is empty, containing no executable statements, functions, or data processing. This lack of content does not suggest malicious intent but could indicate an incomplete or placeholder module. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The absence of code means no security risks or malware behaviors are detectable within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. Its emptiness suggests it is either a stub or placeholder, with no evident security concerns.",
