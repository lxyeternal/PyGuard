  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for icon management in a PyQt6 application. It does not contain malicious, obfuscated, or security-risky behavior. The assigned malware score of 0 and security risk score around 0.1 are appropriate, reflecting minimal security concerns mainly related to external configuration potential but no actual threats."
