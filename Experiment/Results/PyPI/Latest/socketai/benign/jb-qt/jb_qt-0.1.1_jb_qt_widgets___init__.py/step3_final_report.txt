  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network requests, subprocess calls, dynamic eval and exec, hardcoded URLs and credentials.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, system commands, dynamic code execution, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user/env) -> eval/exec -> network/system sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted data, hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, obfuscation patterns, dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in reports 1-4, with no malicious indicators. Report 5 contains multiple suspicious behaviors including dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, and network activity, strongly indicating malicious intent. Scores assigned in reports 1-4 are appropriate and justified by their descriptions. Report 5's high malware (0.8), obfuscation (0.8), and risk (0.85) scores are consistent with the evidence. Overall, the scores align with the analysis, with benign reports correctly scored at zero or low, and the malicious report appropriately scored high.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with low security concern; report 5 demonstrates significant malicious activity justified by its suspicious features. The scoring is consistent with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary.",
