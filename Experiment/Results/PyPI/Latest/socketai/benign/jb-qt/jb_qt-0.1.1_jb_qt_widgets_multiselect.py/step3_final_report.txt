{
  "purpose": "A PyQt6 custom widget implementing a multi-select combo box with grouping and weight filtering features, managing user selections and display updates.",
  "sources": "Data provided via constructor parameters (data, selected), user interactions (item clicks, mouse events), internal methods accessing the view and line edit.",
  "sinks": "Updates to the check state of list items, display text in line edit, emission of selectedChanged signal, internal state modifications.",
  "flows": "User clicks toggle check states -> toggle_check_state updates item states -> update_display_text updates line edit text -> signals emitted on change.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious external calls, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code. Regex for weight extraction is straightforward. External modules ('utils', 'qt_utils') are unspecified but appear benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard PyQt6 widget for multi-selection with grouping and weighting features. It manages UI interactions, maintains internal selection state, and updates display accordingly. No external network activity, credential handling, or obfuscation detected. Regex usage is controlled and benign. Event handling is typical for such widgets. The external modules are not shown but are presumed safe. Overall, the code is well-structured, readable, and free of malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented multi-select combo box widget with grouping and weight filtering. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
