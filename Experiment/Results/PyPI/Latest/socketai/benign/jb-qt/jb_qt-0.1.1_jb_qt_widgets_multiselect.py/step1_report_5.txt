  "purpose": "Custom Qt widget for multi-selection combo box with checkbox support, allowing selection, grouping, and display of selected items.",
  "sources": "Input data for items/groups, user interactions (clicks, wheel events), environment variables indirectly via Qt (though not explicitly), internal method calls.",
  "sinks": "Display text updates, signals emitted on selection change, possible event filters triggered by user interaction.",
  "flows": "User clicks or interacts with the combo box → toggle_check_state updates check states → update_display_text updates the display text and emits signals → set_selected modifies internal selection state → signals notify other components.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no suspicious network activity or data leaks observed. The code performs typical GUI operations. Usage of regex pattern matching for 'weight_re' appears benign, only extracting parts of tags. Event filtering and handling are standard. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or misleading variables evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a custom multi-select combo box using PyQt6, with features for grouping items, multi-selection toggling, and updating display text accordingly. Event filtering prevents unwanted scroll behavior over the input field, and signals notify other parts of the application when the selection changes. The use of regex for 'weight_re' is limited to pattern matching within tags. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. All methods perform expected UI functions. No suspicious code flows or data handling beyond typical GUI logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a multi-select combo box widget with grouping and signal support. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this code segment. It functions solely within GUI context and input handling, with no evidence of data leaks or harmful behavior.",
