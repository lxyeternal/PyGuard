  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the described behavior with the code, evaluating the reasoning, and ensuring consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Correctly identifies the code as a custom multi-select combo box, with user interactions and data input via constructor.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: Correctly notes display updates, signals, and item state changes.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No malicious code, backdoors, external network calls, or obfuscation are observed. Use of external modules ('utils', 'qt_utils') appears benign.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: Well-founded, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment**: The reasoning is sound. The code is standard GUI logic, no malicious activity. The security risk is low, as it handles UI state.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Same as above, accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: Correctly describes event handling and internal state management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No untrusted input handling beyond internal data, no network activity, no obfuscation. Use of regex pattern for weight extraction is controlled via 'consts.TAG_RE'.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: Consistent, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment**: The reasoning is appropriate. No malicious intent detected; the code is a UI component with benign logic.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Correctly identifies the widget's multi-selection and grouping features.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: Properly describes user interactions and internal state updates.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No suspicious code, no external network, no obfuscation, no credential handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: Reasonable, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment**: The code is a typical UI widget, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Correctly describes the widget's features, including weighting.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: Accurate description of toggling, display update, and signal emission.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No hardcoded credentials, no malicious network activity, no obfuscation. Regex pattern for 'weight_re' is benign.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: Well-justified, high confidence (0.95), malware 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment**: The analysis is thorough; the code is a standard multi-select widget with no malicious features.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: Accurate.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No suspicious code, network activity, or obfuscation. Uses regex for 'weight_re' in a benign manner.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: Reasonable, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment**: The code is a typical GUI component with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores**: All are 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores**: All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk scores**: Low (0.1-0.2), justified given the code's UI nature and lack of external communication.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score**: **0** — No signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score**: **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score**: **0.1** — Slightly elevated due to reliance on external utility modules, but overall very low risk.\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are consistent with the code. The code appears to be a well-structured, benign PyQt6 widget for multi-selection with grouping and weighting features. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is evident.",
