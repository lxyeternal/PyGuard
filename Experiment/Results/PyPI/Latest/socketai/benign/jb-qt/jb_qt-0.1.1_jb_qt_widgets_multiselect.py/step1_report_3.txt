  "purpose": "Custom PyQt6 widget for multi-select combo box with checkable items, supporting grouped data and dynamic selection handling.",
  "sources": "User interactions with the combo box (clicks, wheel events), data passed to add_items and set_selected methods, internal signals for selection changes.",
  "sinks": "update_display_text method which updates the QLineEdit text; get_selected method which reads check states.",
  "flows": "User clicks or toggles items -> toggle_check_state updates check states -> update_display_text updates visible text -> _selected_changed emits signal.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex Pattern for weight_re, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious file operations, no network calls, no obfuscated code or dynamic execution. Event filter intercepts mouse release to show popup, which is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a GUI widget with multi-selection features, groupings, and custom behaviors. It reads user interactions from clicks and wheel events. The only external data input is through method parameters or user actions, with no untrusted external sources or network activities. The regex pattern and utility functions seem benign. No hidden backdoors, credential theft, or malicious data leaks are evident. The event filter and custom popup handling are standard UI techniques. No suspicious code execution, obfuscation, or data exfiltration mechanisms detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign custom GUI widget for multi-selection purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or malicious code injection. It performs typical UI functions with no suspicious side effects.",
