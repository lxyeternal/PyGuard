  "purpose": "A standard setup.py script using setuptools with static package metadata.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields: name, version, packages, author, author_email, description, long_description, url, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or external data sources; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources; static metadata remains unchanged.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author_email ('hitler@gmail.com') and url ('https://thugging.org') are unprofessional and potentially malicious or provocative.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic or malicious code. The only anomalies are unprofessional contact details, which could reflect malicious intent or untrustworthiness outside the code's logic. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or active malicious behavior. Malware scores are appropriately zero; obfuscation scores are zero. Risk scores are slightly elevated (~0.2-0.3) due to metadata concerns but do not indicate active threats. The code itself is benign; the primary concern is trustworthiness based on metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe and free of malicious behavior. Metadata raises trust issues but does not constitute active malicious code. Scores are consistent with the analysis; malware and obfuscation are zero, and the security risk is low (~0.2). The metadata should be reviewed for professionalism, but from a security standpoint, the package is benign.",
