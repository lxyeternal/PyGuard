  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python library named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "User input for package name, version, author, author_email, description, long_description, url, classifiers, and python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from defined variables in setup() to package metadata; no flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The author email 'hitler@gmail.com' is suspicious due to the name used, potentially indicating malicious intent or an attempt at shock value; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python library. It defines package metadata such as name, version, author info, description, URL, and classifiers. No malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behaviors are present in the script itself. The only notable concern is the author email and name, which may be intended for malicious or provocative purposes, but the code's functionality remains benign. The script does not include any code that executes untrusted data or interacts with the system beyond packaging metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no embedded malicious behavior. The primary concern is the suspicious author email and name, which could be used for malicious purposes outside this script, but within the provided code, no security risks are detected.",
