  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'notoken887' intended for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Data read from setup() parameters: name, version, packages, author, author_email, description, long_description, url, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or sink points; this is a standard setup script with no data sinks that could cause harm.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: data from the setup parameters is used for package metadata; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Author email is 'hitler@gmail.com'—suspicious and potentially malicious or unprofessional; package name 'notoken887' and description do not indicate malicious intent but may raise concerns about obfuscation or hidden intent. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, utilizing setuptools. All parameters are typical for package metadata. The author email is suspicious and unprofessional, which may suggest malicious intent or malicious reputation, but there is no direct malicious code or behavior. No malicious behaviors such as code execution, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are present. The code is simple and straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns. Overall, the script appears to be a legitimate package setup with some questionable metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with suspicious metadata (author email), but contains no malicious behavior or obfuscation. No malware is present. The risk is minimal but note the unprofessional email as a potential indicator of malicious intent or sabotage.",
