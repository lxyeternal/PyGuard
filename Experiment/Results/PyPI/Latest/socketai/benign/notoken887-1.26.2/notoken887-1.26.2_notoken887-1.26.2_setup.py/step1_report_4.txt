  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python library named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters such as package name, version, author info, description, URL, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, input, or external data sources present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the script is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of suspicious or unprofessional email 'hitler@gmail.com' and URL 'https://thugging.org', which are unusual and potentially malicious or offensive; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no external data processing. The only notable anomaly is the unprofessional email and URL, which could be considered malicious or inappropriate, but do not constitute malicious code or behavior. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious intent are detected based solely on this script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with no malicious code or security risks. The primary concern is the unprofessional contact information, which does not affect code security but may be inappropriate or suspicious from a social perspective.",
