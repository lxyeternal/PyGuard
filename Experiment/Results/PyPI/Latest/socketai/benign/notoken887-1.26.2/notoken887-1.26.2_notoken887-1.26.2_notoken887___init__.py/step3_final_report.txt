  "purpose": "The code is a benign utility or data processing script with no suspicious features.",
  "sources": "Input data reading points, environment variables, or system interactions (if any).",
  "sinks": "Potential data output points, network connections, or file writes (if any).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks without malicious manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. No suspicious features such as eval, exec, hardcoded credentials, or network exfiltration are present. Confidence is high (0.9), malware likelihood is zero, and security risk is low (0.2). The code's benign nature and lack of suspicious signals justify these scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating a benign component with minimal inherent risk.",
