{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test the validation of Israeli bank account numbers using a specific validation function.",
  "sources": "Input data includes function parameters (bank code, branch code, account number) within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no untrusted data flows leading to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Test functions call the validation function with specific parameters, but there are no data flows from untrusted sources or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward test cases; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing framework (pytest) and a validation function from an external module. It runs two simple test assertions for account validation. There are no indications of malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code is minimal and aligns with standard testing practices, with no anomalies or security issues detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite for validating bank account numbers and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
