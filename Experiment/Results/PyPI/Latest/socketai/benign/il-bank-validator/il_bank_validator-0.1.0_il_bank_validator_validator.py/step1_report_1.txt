  "purpose": "Placeholder code indicating the full code is stored elsewhere; no actual functionality present.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; code only contains comments and a pass statement.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no operations or data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as there are no executable statements or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating a large code base and a pass statement, but no actual code; potential placeholder or incomplete code. No suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal placeholder with comments suggesting the presence of a large, detailed code base stored separately (e.g., in a ZIP file). The 'pass' statement indicates no execution occurs here. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or potentially malicious instructions within this snippet. Without additional context or the actual code, no malicious behavior can be identified. The comments hint at complexity, but no actual logic or behavior is present to analyze.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet contains no executable code or logic; it acts as a placeholder referencing external code. Based on this, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within the provided content.",
