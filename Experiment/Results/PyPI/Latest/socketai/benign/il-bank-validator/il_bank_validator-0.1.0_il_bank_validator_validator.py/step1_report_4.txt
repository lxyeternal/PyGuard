  "purpose": "The code appears to be a placeholder or template indicating where the full code should be inserted, with no active functionality or logic present.",
  "sources": "There are no sources of input or data; the code does not read or process any data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data is processed or written anywhere.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as the code contains only a placeholder statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a comment indicating that the actual code is omitted and a 'pass' statement; no suspicious or unusual behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is essentially empty, serving as a placeholder for a larger codebase. It contains no logic, data processing, or external interactions. As such, there are no source or sink points, no data flows, and no anomalies or malicious indicators. Given that it is a stub with no functionality, it cannot be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-functional placeholder with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears intended as a template or to be replaced with actual code later.",
