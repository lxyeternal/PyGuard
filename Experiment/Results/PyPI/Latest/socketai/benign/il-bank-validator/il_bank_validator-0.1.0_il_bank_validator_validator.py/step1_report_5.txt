  "analysis": "The provided code is a minimal placeholder with no executable logic or data handling. There are no sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. Without actual code, no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation can be identified. It appears to be a scaffold or incomplete code template.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a placeholder with no functional content. As such, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is simply a stub awaiting actual implementation.",
