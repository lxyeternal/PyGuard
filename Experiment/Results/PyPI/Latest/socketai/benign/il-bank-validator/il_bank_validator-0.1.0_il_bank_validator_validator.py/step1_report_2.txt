  "purpose": "The code appears to be a placeholder indicating where a large, complete Python source code would be inserted or analyzed, but it contains no executable logic or functionality itself.",
  "sources": "There are no actual data input sources, functions, or data read points in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks, such as data output, network connections, or file writes, present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths exist, as the code contains only a 'pass' statement and comments.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only comments describing a future large codebase and a 'pass' statement, with no executable or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is essentially a placeholder with comments describing a future implementation, including a note about submitting a ZIP file with complete code. There are no functions, data processing, or logic to analyze for security or malicious behavior. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. Given the minimal content, there's no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a non-functional placeholder code snippet with no executable logic. No security risks or malicious behaviors are identifiable in its current form.",
