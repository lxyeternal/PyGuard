{
  "purpose": "Placeholder code indicating that the actual implementation is stored externally, likely in a ZIP file, with no executable logic present.",
  "sources": "Comments and the 'pass' statement; no data input or external data sources within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code is a stub with no operational logic.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, only comments and a 'pass' statement; no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a non-functional placeholder with only comments and a 'pass' statement, indicating that the actual code resides elsewhere, possibly in a ZIP archive. No input sources, data flows, or sinks are present. The code does not perform any operations, nor does it contain obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify this as a scaffold or stub, with high confidence and appropriate low scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The assessments are consistent and justified given the minimal content.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign placeholder with no malicious or security issues. All reports accurately reflect this, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
