  "purpose": "Define a custom exception for invalid bank account inputs.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No data output or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines an exception class.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and minimal; no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a custom exception class inheriting from Python's Exception. It contains a docstring explaining its purpose and an empty 'pass' statement. There are no input/output operations, no external calls, no embedded or obfuscated code. It appears to be a standard exception class definition with no malicious components or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign class definition for a custom exception. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. It is a normal part of application error handling logic.",
