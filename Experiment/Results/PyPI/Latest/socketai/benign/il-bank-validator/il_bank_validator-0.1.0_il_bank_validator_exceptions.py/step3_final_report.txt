  "purpose": "Define a custom exception for invalid bank account input validation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the class is a static exception definition with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward class with a docstring and pass statement.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with a descriptive docstring. It contains no input/output, external calls, or dynamic behavior. The code is minimal, clear, and standard for error handling. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
