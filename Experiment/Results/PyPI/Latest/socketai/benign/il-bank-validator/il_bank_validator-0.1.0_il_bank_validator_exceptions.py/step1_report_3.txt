  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for invalid bank account inputs.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; class definition only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leakage points; class does not process data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simple class declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class inheritance without additional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception by inheriting from Python's Exception class, intended to be used for signaling invalid bank account inputs. It contains only a class declaration with a docstring and a pass statement. There are no inputs, no data processing, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious behavior or embedded malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard class definition serving as a custom exception. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
