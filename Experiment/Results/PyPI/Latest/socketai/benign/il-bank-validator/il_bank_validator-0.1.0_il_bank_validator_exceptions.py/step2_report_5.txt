  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code is a simple class definition:\n     ```python\n     class InvalidBankAccountException(Exception):\n         \"\"\"Raised when a bank account input is invalid.\"\"\"\n         pass\n     ```\n   - It contains no input/output, no external data, no dynamic behavior, and no embedded or obfuscated code.\n   - All reports agree that this is a straightforward custom exception class with no suspicious or malicious features.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code only defines a class with no operational logic.\n   - No flaws or errors are present in the reasoning; the code is minimal and clear.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the code content and the analysis.\n\n4. **Malware and Security Risk Justification**:\n   - Since the code is purely a class definition with no external interactions, no malware activity is possible.\n   - The security risk is also effectively zero, as there's no data processing or external communication.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions and Claims**:\n   - All reports correctly assume the code is benign based on the available snippet.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the analysis is appropriate.\n\n6. **Score Consistency and Reasonableness**:\n   - The scores are reasonable and consistent across all reports.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a standard, benign custom exception class.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (confirmed benign)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary**:\nThis code is a straightforward, benign class definition for a custom exception with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code content.",
