  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only defines a custom exception class with no input/output, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - The original code is straightforward and minimal, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly state that there are no malicious components, no embedded code, and no suspicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable; no changes needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0 for malware and security risk, and the code is benign, no justification for higher scores is necessary.\n   - **Conclusion:** The risk scores are justified as 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they correctly state that the code is only a class definition with no malicious intent.\n   - No unwarranted vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify that this is a benign, straightforward class definition with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent. No modifications or further scrutiny are necessary.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
