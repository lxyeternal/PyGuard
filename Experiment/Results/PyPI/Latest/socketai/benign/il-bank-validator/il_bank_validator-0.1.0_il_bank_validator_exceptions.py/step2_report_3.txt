  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines a class `InvalidBankAccountException` inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - It contains only a docstring and a `pass` statement.\n   - There are no input/output operations, no external data reading or writing, no embedded code, and no dynamic behavior.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward, benign class definition for a custom exception.\n\n2. **Assessment of Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is simple, with no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no data flows, sources, or sinks.\n   - The reasoning in each report is consistent and accurate.\n   - The confidence levels are all at 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not contain any malicious or suspicious components.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Overestimations:**\n   - No issues detected. The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No need to adjust scores.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code is purely definitional with no runtime behavior, the risk is minimal.\n   - The purpose of such exception classes is to improve code clarity and error handling, not to introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, harmless exception class. The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
