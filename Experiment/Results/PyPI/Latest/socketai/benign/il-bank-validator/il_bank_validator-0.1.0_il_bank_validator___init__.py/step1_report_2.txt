{
  "purpose": "The code exports two functions/modules related to validating Israeli bank accounts and an exception class for invalid accounts.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: 'validator' and 'exceptions' files within the same package.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks or data handling points that process untrusted input within this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code itself does not process data; it only exports imported functions/classes for external use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from internal modules and defines an __all__ list for export. It does not perform data processing, network operations, or contain any executable logic beyond imports and export definitions. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The structure is standard for a module's __init__.py or an index file in a package.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, straightforward module export file with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
