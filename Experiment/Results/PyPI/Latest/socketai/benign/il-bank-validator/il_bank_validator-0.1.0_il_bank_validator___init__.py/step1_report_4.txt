  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that exports a validation function for Israeli bank accounts and a custom exception related to invalid bank accounts.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: validate_israeli_bank_account from .validator and InvalidBankAccountException from .exceptions.",
  "sinks": "None directly visible; no external or untrusted data handling, network calls, or sensitive operations are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports validation logic and exception handling but does not execute or invoke them, so no data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are observed; the code is straightforward and consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and exceptions from local modules and declares what is publicly exported. No user input, external data, or environment variables are accessed. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module definition exporting a validation function and an exception class. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on this snippet alone.",
