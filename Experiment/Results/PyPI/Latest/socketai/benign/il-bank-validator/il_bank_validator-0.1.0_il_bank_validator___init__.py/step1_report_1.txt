  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, exposing two symbols. There are no data inputs, no data processing, no network operations, or security-sensitive actions. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behaviors are evident.",
