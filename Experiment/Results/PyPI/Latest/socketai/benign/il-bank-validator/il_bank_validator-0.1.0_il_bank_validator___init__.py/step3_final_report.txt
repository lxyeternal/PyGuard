  "purpose": "Module interface exposing validation function and exception class for Israeli bank accounts.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: validator and exceptions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows, network activity, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; the code only imports and declares exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module interface with only import statements and an __all__ declaration. It does not process data, perform network operations, or contain any suspicious or malicious code. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence scores are high, and the reasoning is consistent. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident or implied. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module interface with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No adjustments are necessary.",
