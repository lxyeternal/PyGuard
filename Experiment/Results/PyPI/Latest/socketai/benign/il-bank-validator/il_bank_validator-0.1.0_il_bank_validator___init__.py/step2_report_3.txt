  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple module interface, primarily consisting of import statements and an `__all__` declaration.\n- No data processing, user input handling, network activity, or other security-sensitive operations are present.\n- The code appears to be a standard part of a larger package, likely an `__init__.py` or index file, exposing specific functions and exceptions.\n- There are no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs noted in any report.\n- All reports confidently state the code is benign, with confidence scores of 1 and no signs of malware or security risks.\n\n**Confirmations & Logical Checks:**\n- The code matches the description: it imports `validate_israeli_bank_account` and `InvalidBankAccountException` from local modules and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- No issues with the code logic or structure.\n- The lack of data flows, sinks, or external interactions confirms that this code snippet alone does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Scores & Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0, justified because there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- Since the code is purely import/export, any security issues would likely stem from the imported modules (`validator` and `exceptions`). However, based solely on this snippet, there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n- No assumptions are made about the imported modules' content; the report focuses only on this snippet.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no suspicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- No modifications needed to the scores or reasoning.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions.",
