  "purpose": "The code exports specific functions and exceptions related to validating Israeli bank accounts.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.validator and .exceptions). No external data sources or user input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports validation logic and exception classes from local modules, then explicitly exports these symbols. There are no operations, data processing, or external communications. The code structure appears standard for a module's __init__.py file, aimed at exposing selected functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a straightforward export of functions and exceptions with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears benign and standard in structure.",
