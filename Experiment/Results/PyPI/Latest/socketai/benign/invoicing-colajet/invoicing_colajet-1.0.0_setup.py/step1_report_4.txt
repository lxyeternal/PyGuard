  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'invoicing-colajet'.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters such as name, packages, version, license, description, author, author_email, url, keywords, install_requires, classifiers.",
  "targets": "Potentially untrusted input could influence these parameters, but in this context, they are hardcoded or static, so no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic or user-provided data flows; the code strictly sets package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. All data appears static and appropriate for a package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with static parameters that define package metadata. There are no code injection points, no reading of external or untrusted data, and no dynamic execution. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. All parameters are typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
