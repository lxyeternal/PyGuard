  "purpose": "Configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data within setup() parameters, including package name, version, author info, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward and static with placeholder metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with static parameters, no dynamic code, external data handling, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The email and URL are placeholders, which are typical in template code but do not indicate malicious intent. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score very low (~0.1) due to placeholder metadata. The code poses no security threat and is consistent with safe package configuration practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are accurate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
