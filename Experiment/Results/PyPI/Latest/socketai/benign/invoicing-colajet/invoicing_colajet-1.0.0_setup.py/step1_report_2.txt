  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package for invoicing conversion from Excel to PDF.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static configuration data within setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no handling of untrusted data or execution of dynamic code.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow or processing logic; only package metadata and dependency declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code follows standard setup.py pattern, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no input/output handling, no code execution beyond package configuration, and no suspicious or malicious code elements. All data appears to be static metadata. The author email is a placeholder, but this is typical in package templates. No indicators of malware or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate for distribution purposes.",
