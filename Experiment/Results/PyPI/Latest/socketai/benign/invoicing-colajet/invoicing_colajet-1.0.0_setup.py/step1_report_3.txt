  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python library for converting Excel invoices to PDFs.",
  "sources": "User inputs such as author_email, url, package name, description, and dependencies; standard library imports.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data being used to perform sensitive operations or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input fields are used solely for package metadata; dependencies are declared for installation purposes; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious modifications. Use of standard setup tools and metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for package configuration. It defines package metadata including name, version, license, description, author details, dependencies, and classifiers. No code execution, data processing, or network activity occurs. All inputs are static and configuration-related. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are present. The script adheres to standard Python packaging practices without anomalies or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup.py script used for Python package distribution. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks are detected. The package appears safe based on this code alone.",
