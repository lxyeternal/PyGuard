  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports identify the code as a standard, static setup.py script using setuptools.\n- No dynamic code, external input handling, or obfuscation is present.\n- No suspicious behavior, code injection, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The email and URL are placeholders, which is common in template code but not inherently malicious.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n- The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any logic that could be exploited or used maliciously.\n- The reports correctly identify that no untrusted data flows, no external code execution, and no obfuscation are present.\n- The purpose of the code is purely to configure package metadata and dependencies, which is inherently safe.\n\n**Potential issues or points of contention:**\n- The email and URL are placeholders; while not malicious, they could be considered incomplete or suspicious in a security review. However, this is typical in template code and not a security concern.\n- Since all reports agree on the benign nature, no changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 is acceptable; the only minor concern is placeholder metadata, which is not a security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the static, standard nature of this setup.py script, I agree with the provided assessments. No anomalies or malicious activity are detected.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to placeholder metadata, but not a security concern)\n\nThis code is a typical, benign package configuration script with no security issues.",
