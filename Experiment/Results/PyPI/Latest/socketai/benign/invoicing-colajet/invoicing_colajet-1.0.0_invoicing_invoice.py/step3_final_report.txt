  "purpose": "Convert invoice Excel files into PDF invoices with embedded data, images, and signatures.",
  "sources": "Excel files in the specified invoices directory, reading data via pandas.read_excel.",
  "sinks": "Embedding images and text into PDFs; no untrusted data flows into system or network.",
  "flows": "Excel data source -> Data processing -> PDF generation with embedded images/signatures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of user-supplied parameters (user_signature, image_path) for embedding images and signatures; filename parsing relies on external format, but neither is inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code reads Excel files, extracts invoice data, and generates PDFs with embedded images and signatures. It uses standard libraries without network activity or code execution. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The only potential concern is the handling of user inputs for images/signatures, which could be malicious if crafted maliciously, but this is typical for document generation scripts. The filename parsing assumes a specific format but is not malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal risk mostly due to input handling. Overall, the code is a legitimate invoice generator with no malicious intent or behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, legitimate invoice generator with no signs of malicious activity or security flaws. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
