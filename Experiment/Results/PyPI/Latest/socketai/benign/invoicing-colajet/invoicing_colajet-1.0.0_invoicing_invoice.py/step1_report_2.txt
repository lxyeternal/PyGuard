  "purpose": "Convert invoice Excel files into PDF format, including table data, totals, and images.",
  "sources": "Reading Excel files with pandas.read_excel, reading image_path for logo, glob.glob for listing files, Path for filename parsing.",
  "sinks": "Writing PDF files with FPDF.output, reading files from specified directories, reading images for inclusion.",
  "flows": "Excel files are read from invoices_path; data is processed; PDF is generated and saved in pdfs_path; image_path is read for logo inclusion.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious external network calls, no malicious file handling or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script processes files from a specified directory, reads invoice data from Excel, formats and generates PDFs with the invoice details, total sums, and a logo image. It creates directories if needed. No external network communication, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious file manipulations are present. The image_path is used solely for including a logo, and all file paths are constructed safely. The use of pandas and fpdf libraries is standard for such tasks, and there are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate invoice generation utility with no malicious intent. It processes input files securely, generates PDFs with invoice details, and saves them appropriately. There are no signs of malware, malicious data leaks, or security risks within this code.",
