  "purpose": "Convert Excel invoice files into PDF invoices, including data from Excel sheets and images.",
  "sources": "Reading Excel files from the specified invoices_path using glob.glob; reading specific columns and data from each Excel file using pandas.read_excel; reading the image file specified by image_path.",
  "sinks": "Writing PDF files to the specified pdfs_path; inserting images into PDFs; summing data from Excel columns.",
  "flows": "Excel files are read from invoices_path; data is extracted and processed; PDF is generated with invoice details, table, total, and image; output is saved to pdfs_path.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscated code are present. Usage of external libraries (pandas, fpdf, glob, pathlib, os) appears standard. The code generates PDFs based solely on input files and parameters provided, with no evident malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward invoice PDF generator that reads Excel files, extracts data, and creates PDFs with formatted content and images. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or suspicious data handling are observed. It does not include any backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. The image_path input is used to include an image in the PDF but not in a malicious context. The functions and variables are descriptive and aligned with typical invoice generation workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to perform legitimate invoice PDF generation with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It processes data securely from local files, generates PDF invoices, and saves them appropriately. No malware indicators or security risks are identified.",
