  "purpose": "Convert Excel invoices into PDF format with embedded details and images",
  "sources": "glob.glob for reading Excel files, pd.read_excel for reading data, pdf.image for adding images, user_signature parameter for signature text",
  "sinks": "pdf.output for saving PDF files, pdf.image for embedding images, os.makedirs for creating directories",
  "flows": "Reading Excel files from specified directory, processing data, generating PDFs with data and images, saving PDFs to output directory",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code injection or network activity, no obfuscated code or unusual constructs, direct usage of user input in filenames and data, but no malicious pattern observed",
  "analysis": "The script reads invoice Excel files from a specified directory, processes data, and generates PDF invoices with embedded images and text. It uses safe libraries (os, pandas, glob, fpdf, pathlib). No dynamic code execution, no data leakage mechanisms, and no network activity are present. The only potential concern is the use of user-provided 'user_signature' and 'image_path' for generating files, which could be misused if these inputs are maliciously crafted. However, in this context, they are used solely for document generation, not for code execution or network communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an invoice generator converting Excel data into PDFs with embedded images and text. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms. It appears safe under normal usage. No malware or security risks identified.",
