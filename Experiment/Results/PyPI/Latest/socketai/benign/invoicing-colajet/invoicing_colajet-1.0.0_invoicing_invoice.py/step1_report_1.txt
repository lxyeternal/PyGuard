  "purpose": "Convert invoice Excel files into PDF format with embedded data, logos, and signatures.",
  "sources": "Reads Excel files from the specified invoices_path directory; reads image for logo; reads filename for invoice number and date.",
  "sinks": "Writes PDF files to the specified pdfs_path directory; uses input parameters for user_signature and image_path.",
  "flows": "Excel files are read, data is processed, and PDF files are generated with embedded data and images.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. Usage of dynamic filename parsing could be exploited if filename format is manipulated externally but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code reads Excel invoice files from a specified directory, extracts data, formats it into a PDF invoice, and saves it to a target directory. It uses the filename to derive invoice number and date, and embeds an image as a logo. No network operations, system command executions, or secret data handling are present. The image and signature are input parameters, which could be misused if supplied maliciously, but this is typical for customizable invoice generation. The code appears straightforward without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves a legitimate function of invoice generation. No malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious activities are evident. It performs expected file I/O, data processing, and PDF creation without security risks like code injection or data leakage.",
