  "purpose": "Importing the 'generate' function from the local 'invoice' module, likely used for creating invoices.",
  "sources": "The import statement indicates the code sources functionality from a local module file 'invoice'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not perform any data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable from this single import statement alone.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident. The import does not by itself indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement from a relative module, which is standard in Python projects. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors. Without additional context or code, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger project for invoice generation. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected based solely on this snippet.",
