  "sinks": "No sinks present in this snippet; no data output or external connections",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with only an import statement",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "This code performs a straightforward import of a function named generate from a local invoice module. There are no inputs, outputs, or external communications in this snippet. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs, and it appears to be a typical module import statement. The code does not show any signs of embedded malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. Given its simplicity, it is unlikely to be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign component of a larger project.",
