{
  "purpose": "Import the 'generate' function from the local 'invoice' module, likely for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are involved in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; the code only imports a function, with no external communication or data handling.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'generate' from the local module; no data flow beyond module import is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of a function from a local module. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are apparent. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, with high confidence scores and zero malware and obfuscation scores. The security risk is minimal, consistent with standard Python practices. Without additional context or implementation details of 'generate', no further risks can be inferred. The import alone does not indicate any malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, performing a simple import without any signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
