{
  "purpose": "The code imports a generate function from a local invoice module, likely for generating invoices.",
  "sources": "The import statement from a local module (.invoice import generate)",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink path can be established from this single line.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a relative import of a function named generate from the invoice module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. Without additional context or code, it is impossible to determine if the generate function itself contains malicious code, but the import statement alone is benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this single line of code, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard import statement for a function likely used elsewhere in the project.",
