  "purpose": "Define package metadata for a placeholder or dummy Python package.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields within the setup() call, including name, version, author, description, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "None; static data used solely for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual version string '0.0.0.1'; empty author and author_email fields; no dynamic code or external input.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static setup script with no dynamic or malicious components. The version string is unconventional but not malicious. No obfuscated code, network activity, or code injection is present. The metadata indicates a placeholder package, which is benign. The absence of code execution or external data flows confirms low security risk. The anomalies are typical for placeholder packages and do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The package is a benign, static placeholder with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The minor anomalies are typical placeholders and do not elevate security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: approximately 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
