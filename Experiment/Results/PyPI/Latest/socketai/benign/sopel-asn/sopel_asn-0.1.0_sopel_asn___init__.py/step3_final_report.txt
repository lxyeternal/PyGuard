  "purpose": "Assessment of open source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, file reads, data inputs, potential network or system calls, dynamic execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system operations, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources (inputs/envs) to sinks (network/file/system commands), possibly via dynamic execution or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; potential dynamic execution noted but unconfirmed.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently identify no evidence of malicious code or obfuscation. Risk scores are mostly low (0.1-0.4), justified by cautious consideration of dynamic execution potential. Confidence levels are high (0.8-0.9). The scores align with the reasoning, and no adjustments are necessary. The code appears benign with no significant security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is assessed as benign, with no malware or obfuscation detected. The moderate security risk score in some reports reflects cautious awareness of dynamic execution risks but is justified given the lack of concrete malicious indicators. Overall, the dependency is considered safe based on the provided analyses.",
