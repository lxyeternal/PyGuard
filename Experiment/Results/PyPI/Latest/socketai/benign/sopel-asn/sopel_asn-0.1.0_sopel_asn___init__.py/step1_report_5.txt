  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python module possibly intended for general utility or specific data processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, or imported modules. No external untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to logs, files, or network endpoints; specific sinks are not clearly identifiable without further context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions and then to output or storage sinks, but no suspicious source-to-sink paths are explicitly evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are observed. No obfuscation or unusual language features present. No malicious code snippets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard Python with clear structure. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection are visible. Usage of third-party libraries seems typical, with no suspicious activity. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or obfuscated segments. Overall, the code appears benign with no evident security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security threats. It appears to be a legitimate, straightforward Python module. Based on the provided code fragment, there is low likelihood of malware or security issues.",
