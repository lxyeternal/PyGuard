      "conclusion": "The code is assessed as benign, with no malware or obfuscation detected. The moderate security risk score in some reports reflects cautious awareness of dynamic execution risks but is justified given the lack of concrete malicious indicators. Overall, the dependency is considered safe based on the provided analyses."

      "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate DNS-based ASN/IP lookups without any malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects reliance on external DNS responses but is acceptable given the context."
