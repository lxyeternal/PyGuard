{
  "purpose": "Perform DNS TXT lookups to retrieve ASN or routing information based on user input (IP or ASN) for an IRC bot.",
  "sources": "User command arguments, DNS TXT records from Cymru's DNS servers.",
  "sinks": "Output messages sent via bot.reply or bot.say to IRC channels/users.",
  "flows": "User input -> validation -> DNS query construction -> DNS resolution -> response parsing -> formatted output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward DNS queries, proper validation, no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code validates ASN and IP inputs, constructs DNS queries accordingly, performs DNS TXT lookups with exception handling, and formats responses for display. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. DNS responses are trusted external data, but this is standard for such lookups. Minor code clarity improvements are possible but do not impact security. Overall, the code is a benign, well-structured ASN/IP lookup plugin with minimal security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate DNS-based ASN/IP lookups without any malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects reliance on external DNS responses but is acceptable given the context.",
