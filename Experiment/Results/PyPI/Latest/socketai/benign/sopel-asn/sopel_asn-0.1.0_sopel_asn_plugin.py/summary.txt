  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate DNS-based ASN/IP lookups without any malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects reliance on external DNS responses but is acceptable given the context."
