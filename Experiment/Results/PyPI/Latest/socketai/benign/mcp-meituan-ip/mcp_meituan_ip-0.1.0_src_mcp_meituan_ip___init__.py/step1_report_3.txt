{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point that imports a server module and runs its main function asynchronously.",
  "sources": "The code reads the server module import, and the call to server.main() within asyncio.run.",
  "sinks": "The server.main() function execution could be a sink if it contains untrusted input handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "The code imports server, then asynchronously executes server.main() upon invocation of main().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures observed. The code is straightforward and typical for an entry point.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a local module 'server' and defines a main() function that executes server.main() asynchronously. It then exposes main and server at the package level. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is minimal, serving as a simple bootstrap for the server module. Without inspecting server.main(), it is impossible to determine its internal behavior, but the current script itself shows no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard entry point for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in its structure. Its security implications depend on the implementation of server.main(), which is outside the scope of this review.",
