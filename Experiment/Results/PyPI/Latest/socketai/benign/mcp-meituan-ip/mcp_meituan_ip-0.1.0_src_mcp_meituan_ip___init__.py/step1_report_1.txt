{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point to run the 'main' function from the 'server' module asynchronously, and exposes 'main' and 'server' at the package level.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'server' module and invokes 'server.main()'. It also accesses the special variable '__all__'.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks in this code that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The 'asyncio.run(server.main())' flow executes the 'main' function from 'server', which could involve further data handling internally, but no data flows are explicitly visible here.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual language features, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local 'server' module and runs its 'main()' asynchronously, which is typical for a command-line entry point. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are accessed. The '__all__' variable exposes 'main' and 'server' for package-level access. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The simplicity and clarity of the code reduce the likelihood of malicious intent or hidden malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple, legitimate package entry point for executing 'server.main()' asynchronously. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks identified in this fragment.",
