  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point to run the main function of the server module asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Importing server module, reading package-level __all__ list, calling server.main() within asyncio.run()",
  "sinks": "asyncio.run(server.main()) - executes server.main() potentially using untrusted input if server.main() is malicious or compromised",
  "flows": "Code imports server, then executes server.main() via asyncio.run(), which could be a malicious or compromised function if the server module contains malicious code",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual logic. The only potential concern is reliance on server.main() without context",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, typical package entry point that asynchronously runs server.main(). It imports server, which could contain malicious code, but the script itself does not contain suspicious behavior. The code structure is standard and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious patterns. The security concern depends on the integrity of the server module, which is external to this code. There are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious data flows within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple bootstrap to execute server.main() asynchronously. It does not contain malicious behavior on its own. The security risk is primarily dependent on the contents of the imported server module. No anomalies or malicious indicators are evident in this snippet.",
