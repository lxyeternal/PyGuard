{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point for a Python package, calling the main function from a local 'server' module within an asynchronous context.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'server' module import, and the call to 'server.main()' via asyncio.run().",
  "sinks": "The call to 'asyncio.run(server.main())' executes the 'main' function of the 'server' module, which could potentially contain untrusted operations, but no direct untrusted input is explicitly handled here.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing the 'server' module, then executing 'server.main()' inside asyncio.run(), which could involve further internal source-to-sink data flows depending on 'server.main()' implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The code itself is minimal and standard, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The structure is typical for an async main entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local 'server' module and executes its 'main()' function asynchronously. It acts as a simple launcher. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are directly used here. The security risk and malware potential depend entirely on the implementation of 'server.main()'. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident in this fragment. The code's simplicity and adherence to common patterns suggest low likelihood of malicious intent. No anomalies, secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign entry point for a package, relying on the 'server' module's 'main()' function. Without inspecting 'server.main()', there are no immediate security concerns or malicious behavior identifiable in this snippet.",
