  "purpose": "Provides an async entry point for a Python package by executing server.main() and exposing key functions.",
  "sources": "Import of local 'server' module, call to 'server.main()' within main()",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'server.main()' which could contain untrusted or malicious code",
  "flows": "main() calls asyncio.run(server.main()), which executes code within 'server.main()'",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, minimal code with no obfuscation or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard async entry point that delegates execution to 'server.main()'. It does not process untrusted data directly, nor does it contain suspicious patterns. The security and malware risk depend entirely on the implementation of 'server.main()', which is external. The code itself shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal inherent risk, acknowledging external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious patterns. The security posture relies on the external 'server.main()' implementation. Based solely on this snippet, there are no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
