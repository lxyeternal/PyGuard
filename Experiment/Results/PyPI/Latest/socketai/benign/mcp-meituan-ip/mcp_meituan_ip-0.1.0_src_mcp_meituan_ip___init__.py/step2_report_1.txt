  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports a local `server` module.\n- Defines `main()` which runs `server.main()` asynchronously via `asyncio.run()`.\n- Exposes `main` and `server` via `__all__`.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows common patterns for an async entry point.\n- No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are directly accessed.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The security and malware scores are all zero or very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues are present; the code is simple and standard.\n- **Malware presence:** No signs of malicious behavior; scores are 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; scores are 0.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities are evident in this snippet; scores are low (~0.1-0.2).\n\n### Critical points:\n- The actual security risk and malware potential depend heavily on the implementation of `server.main()`, which is outside this snippet.\n- The code itself does not process untrusted data or perform any suspicious actions.\n\n### Scores:\n- The scores assigned in reports (mostly 0 or 0.2 for security risk, 0 for malware) seem reasonable given the code.\n- The confidence levels vary but are generally high (0.8-1), which is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since the code does not contain any malicious or suspicious patterns, increasing malware or risk scores would be unjustified without inspecting `server.main()`.\n- The current scores appropriately reflect the benign nature of this code fragment.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, mostly due to reliance on external `server.main()`)\n\n**Note:** The overall security posture hinges on `server.main()`. If that function is malicious or insecure, the risk could be higher, but based solely on this snippet, the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent with the code. No modifications needed. The code is a benign, standard async entry point with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
