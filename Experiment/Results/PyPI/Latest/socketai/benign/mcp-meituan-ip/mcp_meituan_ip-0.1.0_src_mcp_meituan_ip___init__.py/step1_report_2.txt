  "purpose": "Main entry point that runs the server's main function asynchronously",
  "sources": "Importing 'server' module, reading the main() function, and calling asyncio.run() with server.main()",
  "sinks": "asyncio.run() executes server.main(), which may contain untrusted data processing or network operations",
  "flows": "Import 'server' -> call 'server.main()' via asyncio.run() -> execute server's main logic",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated elements; straightforward execution",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local server module and runs its main() function asynchronously. The code is simple and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior. It acts as an entry point for the package, delegating execution to server.main(). No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded credentials, and no dynamic code execution are evident. The code's structure and content are typical for a package's main script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard entry point for a Python package, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It simply invokes the server module's main function asynchronously, which is a common pattern.",
