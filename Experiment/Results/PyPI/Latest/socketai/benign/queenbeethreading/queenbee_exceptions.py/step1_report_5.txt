  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for handling errors related to QueenBeeThreading",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leak points present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as there are no data inputs or outputs",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward with standard exception class implementation; no unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class 'BeeException' inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. It includes a docstring explaining its purpose. The constructor sets a default error message 'BeeError!' but allows custom messages. The implementation is standard and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign custom exception class with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
