  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the code, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with no external inputs, outputs, or complex logic. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is minimal and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly note the absence of suspicious constructs, external data handling, or malicious intent. No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Malware: 0\n- Security Risk: 0  \nThese are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Scores > 0.5**  \nNo report assigns a score above 0.5 for malware or security risk, which aligns with the code's benign profile. The scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nAll reports assign malware score 0, which is correct. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports base their conclusions on direct code analysis, not assumptions. They correctly avoid speculative claims.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class with no security issues.**",
