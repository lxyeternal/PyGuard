  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward class definition inheriting from Exception, with a constructor setting a default message.\n- No external inputs, data flows, or output sinks are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The code is minimal, standard, and benign.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify that the code is a simple exception class with no malicious intent.\n- No errors or logical flaws are present in the reports.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty.\n- These scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- Since the code is purely a class definition with no external interactions, no data flows, and no suspicious constructs, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n- The current scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate.\n\n**5. Malware Score Reflection:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct given the benign nature.\n- No malicious behavior or hidden payloads are suggested or implied.\n\n**6. Challenging Assumptions about Vulnerabilities:**\n- All reports assume the code is benign based on static analysis.\n- There are no assumptions about vulnerabilities that need challenging; the assessment is accurate.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n- The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Recommendations:\n\n- **Overall Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions mean it poses no security threat.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\nNo changes needed.",
