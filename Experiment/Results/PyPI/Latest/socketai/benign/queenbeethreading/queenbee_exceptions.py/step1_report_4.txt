  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink as no data processing occurs",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definition with no suspicious elements",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Python's Exception. It includes a docstring explaining its purpose and a constructor that sets a default error message. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious constructs present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard custom exception class with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious behaviors.",
