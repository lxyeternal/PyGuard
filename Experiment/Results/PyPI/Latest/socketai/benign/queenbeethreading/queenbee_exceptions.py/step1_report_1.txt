  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for errors generated by QueenBeeThreading.",
  "sources": "The class constructor receives a message parameter; no external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external output; the code solely defines an exception class.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the class simply initializes an exception object.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no unusual constructs, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception, intended for handling specific errors related to QueenBeeThreading. It uses standard Python class syntax and super() for initialization. No hardcoded credentials, external communications, or malicious patterns are present. The class is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign definition of a custom exception class with no malicious intent or security issues.",
