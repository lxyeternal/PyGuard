  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for errors generated by QueenBeeThreading.",
  "sources": "No external input, data reading, or data flow; class constructor with default message.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; simple class definition without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class with no obfuscation or suspicious features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with a constructor setting a default message. No external data, network operations, or complex logic are present. The class is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and clarity are consistent with the benign assessment. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class with no security issues or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect its safe nature. No modifications are necessary.",
