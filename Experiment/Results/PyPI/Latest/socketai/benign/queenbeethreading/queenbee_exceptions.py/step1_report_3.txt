  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for errors generated by QueenBeeThreading.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading mechanisms present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leakage points; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data propagation, as the class only defines an exception.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward; no unusual or suspicious constructs, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with a default message. There are no external data sources, no untrusted data handling, or network activities. The class appears to serve as a specialized exception for threading errors related to QueenBee. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The implementation is minimal and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
