  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence presented, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a comprehensive Python SDK for API interaction, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It uses standard libraries, handles retries, errors, platform detection, and pagination.\n\n- **Analysis & Evidence:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Use of `random()` for jitter is standard. Response handling is careful, errors are raised appropriately.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low risk score aligns with the evidence. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a robust HTTP client SDK with platform detection, retries, and response processing, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Analysis & Evidence:** Uses standard libraries, environment info, UUIDs, and request handling. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors. Platform detection functions are benign.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The logic is consistent. No suspicious behavior. The low malware score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, emphasizing platform detection, retries, and request handling. No malicious code or sabotage detected.\n\n- **Analysis & Evidence:** Uses environment info for headers, response validation, and standard request/response patterns. No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** Well-reasoned. No signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code constructs an HTTP client SDK with retries, platform detection, and response handling. No malicious activity or sabotage signs.\n\n- **Analysis & Evidence:** Uses standard libraries, jitter for retries, environment info, and typical SDK patterns. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a multi-platform HTTP client SDK with robust error handling, retries, and telemetry headers, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Analysis & Evidence:** Uses standard patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious code, and typical SDK telemetry.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The logic and evidence support a low-risk, legitimate SDK.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the evidence supports this. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or exfiltration patterns are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, standard code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1), justified by the potential for misconfiguration or environment-specific issues, but no actual malicious risk.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious code, sabotage, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard libraries.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Minimal, mostly related to potential misconfigurations or environment issues, not malicious intent.\n\n**Note:** The code appears to be a well-designed, legitimate SDK for API interactions, with no malicious or sabotage elements detected.",
