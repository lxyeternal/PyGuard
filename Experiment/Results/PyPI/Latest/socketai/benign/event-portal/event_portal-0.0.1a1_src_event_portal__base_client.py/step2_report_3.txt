  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a comprehensive SDK with standard request/response handling, platform detection, retries, pagination.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code. Uses standard libraries and practices. Random jitter in retries is common.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, secure, and free of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (minimal), Confidence = 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The minimal security risk is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, emphasizing environment detection, request handling, retries.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity; platform detection and request retries are standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Also consistent. No red flags.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on request/response handling, platform detection, and retries.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; environment info used for headers and diagnostics.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK, no signs of sabotage.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with focus on request/response, platform detection, and retry logic.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code; use of jitter and platform detection is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate SDK.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general purpose, detailed request/response handling, platform info.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; all patterns are typical.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure SDK.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity, no embedded backdoors or data exfiltration. The use of `random()` for jitter is standard, not malicious.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard libraries.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any malicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or sabotage, a risk score of 0.1 is appropriate—indicating minimal security concern, primarily due to the complexity of network interactions and platform detection.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is transparent and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — very low, consistent with a well-designed SDK.\n\n**Note:** The reports are consistent with each other, and no suspicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. The overall security posture of this code appears solid and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
