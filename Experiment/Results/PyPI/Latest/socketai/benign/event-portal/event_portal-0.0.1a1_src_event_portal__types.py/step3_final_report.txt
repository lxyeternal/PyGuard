{
  "purpose": "The code provides type aliases, protocols, and utility classes for an HTTP client library, focusing on data structures, type safety, and interface definitions without runtime logic.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class definitions, and protocol methods that define data models and interfaces; no external data input or untrusted sources are processed.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data output that could lead to leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is static type definitions and protocols without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type aliases, protocols, and utility classes for an HTTP client setup, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions. It adheres to standard Python typing practices and does not contain any malicious or obfuscated elements. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is minimal (~0.1), justified by its static, definitional nature. No security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions and protocols for an HTTP client library, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scores are consistent with its static, non-executable nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
