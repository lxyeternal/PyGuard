{
  "purpose": "Defines type aliases, protocols, and utility classes for an HTTP client library using httpx, along with support for file uploads and response handling.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (os, typing, httpx, pydantic), type definitions, class and function declarations, constants, and protocols.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data for malicious effects; mainly type definitions and class declarations.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up types and protocols.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscated code. Use of type checking and annotations is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type aliases, protocol definitions, and utility classes for an HTTP client, with support for various file types and request options. It appears to be a standard setup for a HTTP client library. There are no indications of malicious code, data leakage, or unauthorized data transmission. The use of imports and type annotations is typical and does not suggest obfuscation or malware. No external or internal data is read insecurely, nor are there any evident attempts to exfiltrate data or harm the system.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical setup for an HTTP client utility library with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It mainly contains type definitions and protocol declarations, which are common in such libraries.",
