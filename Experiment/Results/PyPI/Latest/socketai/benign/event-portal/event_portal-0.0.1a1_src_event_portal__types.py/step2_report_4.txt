  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely type definitions, protocols, and utility classes for an HTTP client. No data flows, no untrusted data processing, no code execution, or malicious patterns. The report correctly concludes minimal security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low). These seem reasonable given the purely definitional nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, this code is a set of type aliases, protocols, and class definitions for an HTTP client library. No runtime logic or data processing that could be malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. No issues here.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is mainly type annotations, protocols, and data structures for an HTTP client. No active data handling or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, no malicious code, no data exfiltration, no obfuscation. Standard type setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above—type definitions, protocols, data models, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Justification:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe code that is purely about type annotations, protocols, data structures, and utility classes for an HTTP client library using `httpx` and `pydantic`.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code (library setup, no runtime logic, no data handling), a very low risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate, as it is standard library code with no evident security issues.\n\n### Final Overall Estimation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.05–0.1 (minimal, standard library code with no security concerns)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of type definitions and protocols for an HTTP client library, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nKeep the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at their current low levels. No adjustments needed.",
