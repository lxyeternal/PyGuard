{
  "purpose": "This code defines types, protocols, and utility classes for a Python HTTP client based on httpx, focusing on data structures, type annotations, and configuration options.",
  "sources": "Code reads input mainly from type annotations, class and function definitions, and variable initializations.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data in a way that could lead to data leaks or malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "The code primarily establishes type definitions and protocol interfaces; no runtime data flow or untrusted data handling is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments detected. Usage of `TypeVar`, `TypedDict`, and protocols are standard for type hinting. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code appears. The presence of detailed type annotations and protocols indicates well-structured code, not malicious obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of type definitions, protocols, and utility classes for a Python HTTP client. It carefully uses type hints, protocols, and classes to define expected behaviors and data structures. No dynamic evaluation, code injection, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a library/framework for HTTP operations, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, non-malicious set of type definitions and protocols for an HTTP client. It does not contain any malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal.",
