{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling API errors in an HTTP client context, specifically for an Event Portal API.",
  "sources": "Input sources include HTTP responses, request objects, and error messages passed during exception initialization.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could include response bodies and error messages that are passed to exceptions, but these are used solely for error handling and logging.",
  "flows": "Data flows from HTTP responses and request objects into exception objects when errors occur, primarily for error reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code contains standard exception class definitions and error handling logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of custom exception classes inheriting from a base error class, with attributes to hold HTTP request and response data, as well as error messages. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscation techniques, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads. The design is consistent with normal error handling practices for HTTP-based APIs. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as network exfiltration or backdoors, are present. All data used in exceptions appears to be for debugging or error reporting only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom API error classes intended for handling HTTP errors. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It appears safe and typical for a Python client library dealing with HTTP APIs.",
