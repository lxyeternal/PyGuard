{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling various API errors, including connection issues, HTTP status errors, and validation problems, for an API client.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, exception handling, and imported modules. No user input or external data sources are explicitly read within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform dangerous actions are present. The code only defines exception classes and imports.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input to potentially dangerous sinks; exception handling occurs locally within class constructors.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. All classes and methods follow standard patterns for API error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for API error management. It imports 'httpx' to work with HTTP requests and responses, and defines classes with clear inheritance hierarchies. No dynamic code execution, untrusted data processing, or suspicious activities are detected. The code appears to be purely for error handling and does not perform any malicious or insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical error handling module for an API client, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It only defines exception classes and relies on external libraries without performing any sensitive operations.",
