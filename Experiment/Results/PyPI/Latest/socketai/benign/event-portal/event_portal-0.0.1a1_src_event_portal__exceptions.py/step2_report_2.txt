  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code defines exception classes for API error handling. No dynamic code, untrusted data processing, or malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate, as there's no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of security concerns.  \n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate; the code is standard error handling with no security issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the code is about defining exception classes with no untrusted data processing or malicious activity.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — slightly above zero, possibly considering the potential for exception data to be misused, but given the code's nature, this is acceptable.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious intent or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard exception classes with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward code.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — consistent with the code's purpose.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; no security risks.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, standard error classes, no dynamic code or untrusted data handling.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear code.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same conclusion; no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — accurate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is simple.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — consistent with the code's nature.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \n- **Code content:** Purely defines exception classes for API error handling.  \n- **Malware risk:** None detected.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None.  \n- **Security risk score:** Appropriately low, given the nature of the code.\n\n**My own assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk, as the code is purely for error handling and does not process untrusted data in a dangerous way.\n\n**Final note:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is standard, benign, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
