{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various API error responses, facilitating structured error management in an API client.",
  "sources": "No untrusted data input; class attributes are set from API response objects during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted response bodies stored in exception attributes; no execution or processing of untrusted data occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "Error response data flows into exception objects, primarily stored as attributes; no code execution or data manipulation occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for API error handling, utilizing 'httpx' request and response objects. There is no dynamic code execution, data processing, or external input handling that could be exploited. The exception classes are standard, with attributes capturing request and response details. The minimal security risk score (0.1) in some reports reflects the potential for error response bodies to contain untrusted data, but since the code only stores this data without processing it, the risk remains negligible. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and aligns with best practices for error handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard, safe implementation of API error classes with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
