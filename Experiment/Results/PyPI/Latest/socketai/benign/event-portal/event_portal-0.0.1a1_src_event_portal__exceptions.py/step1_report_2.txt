{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling API errors related to an Event Portal, including different HTTP status errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from function parameters such as 'message', 'request', 'body', 'response', and 'status_code'. No external or untrusted input is directly read within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be exception handling and error propagation, but there is no execution of untrusted data or dynamic code based on these variables.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API responses and request objects into exception classes to provide detailed error information, but there are no dynamic or unsafe operations based on untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code is straightforward class definitions for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines custom exception classes for API error handling. It includes attributes for request and response objects, with no dynamic execution, data leakage, or malicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or external data handling is present. The structure and content are typical for an error handling module, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of API error classes for a client library. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger API client module.",
