  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the issues, scores, and conclusions are appropriate.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines error classes; no untrusted data or external input is processed.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code content. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines error classes; no untrusted input read.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, only structured error handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, risk=0.1.  \n**Assessment:** The securityRisk is marked as 0.1, which is very low. Since there's no indication of any vulnerability or malicious activity, this seems reasonable. The report's reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above; purely class definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is standard error handling classes with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Error classes, no untrusted input processing.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Error classes, no external input read.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is purely defining exception classes for API error handling.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious activity is present.\n- The malware scores are appropriately zero.\n- The securityRisk scores are also correctly minimal or zero, reflecting no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — standard error handling code with no security implications.\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a standard, benign part of an API client library. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code content. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
