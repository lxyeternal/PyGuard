{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various API errors and connection issues related to an Event Portal API client.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads untrusted input directly; it mainly defines classes and error handling structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; the code does not perform I/O operations or handle external data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely class definitions and error handling logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of exception class definitions for API error handling, including detailed error information such as request and response objects. It leverages type annotations and custom error classes to facilitate structured error management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or malicious data collection. It appears to be standard error handling code for a Python API client.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for API error handling with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard pattern used in API client libraries.",
