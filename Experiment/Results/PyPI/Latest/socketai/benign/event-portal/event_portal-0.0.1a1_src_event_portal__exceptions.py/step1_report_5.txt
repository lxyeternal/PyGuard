{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various API error responses in an HTTP client.",
  "sources": "None; the code primarily defines classes and exception handling logic without external input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or data leaks present in this code.",
  "flows": "None; the code consists of class definitions and exception handling, with no runtime data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be standard API error handling class definitions without obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured set of exception classes for API error management, inheriting from a base exception. It uses standard Python syntax and typing, with no dynamic execution, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious constructs. The classes encapsulate HTTP error information for use in a larger API client, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom API exception classes for an HTTP client, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured part of an API handling library.",
