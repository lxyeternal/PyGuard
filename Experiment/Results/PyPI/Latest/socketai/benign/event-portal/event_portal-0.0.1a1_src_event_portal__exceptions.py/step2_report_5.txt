  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the code to assess potential security risks, malware presence, obfuscation, and the validity of the reported issues.\n\n**Overall Code Content:**\n- The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for handling API errors.\n- It imports 'httpx' for HTTP request/response objects.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, or external data handling occurs.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The classes are straightforward, mainly storing error details for downstream handling.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Error class definitions for API client.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data processing, no malicious behavior.\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Completely benign, standard error handling.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues or risks. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Defines API error classes with detailed attributes.\n- **Findings:** No external or untrusted input read; no dynamic code.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe error classes.\n\n**Note:** The security risk score is slightly above zero, likely due to the potential for exception data (like response bodies) to contain untrusted data. However, since this code only defines exception classes without processing or executing this data, the risk remains minimal.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The risk score can remain at 0.1, reflecting cautious acknowledgment that error data could be untrusted if misused elsewhere, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to Report 2, with consistent findings.\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The code is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: class definitions for API errors, no malicious behavior.\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Again, standard exception classes with no suspicious activity.\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, consistent with the code's nature as error class definitions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Generally 0, with one report at 0.1, reflecting minimal concern over untrusted data in error bodies.\n\n### Justification of Scores\n\n- The code is purely structural, defining exception classes.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, or external input handling that could be exploited.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.\n- The slight security risk score (0.1) is appropriate given that error bodies could contain untrusted data, but this is a standard and expected scenario in error handling modules.\n\n### Final Recommendation\n\n**Overall Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (maintained for cautiousness, but effectively minimal)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, safe error handling module with no malicious intent or security risks. No modifications or warnings are necessary.",
