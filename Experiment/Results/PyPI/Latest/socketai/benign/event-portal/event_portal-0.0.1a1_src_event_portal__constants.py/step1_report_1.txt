{
  "purpose": "The code defines constants for HTTP request configuration, such as headers, timeout, retries, and connection limits, likely used in an HTTP client interacting with an API.",
  "sources": "Constants are defined directly in the code; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data is written to external systems or untrusted destinations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only sets static configuration values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code is straightforward and standard for HTTP client setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'httpx' and sets several constants related to HTTP request configurations, including headers, timeout durations, retry policies, and connection limits. These are typical for configuring a client library for API calls. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic data processing is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent. The code appears to be a legitimate setup for HTTP request parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration setup for an HTTP client, with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It does not contain any obfuscation or malware signals. The overall security risk is negligible.",
