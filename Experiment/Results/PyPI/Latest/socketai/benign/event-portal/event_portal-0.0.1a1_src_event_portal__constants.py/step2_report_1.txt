  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static configuration constants for an HTTP client using the httpx library.\n- No dynamic input, user data, or external data sources are involved.\n- No code obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or anomalies are identified.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident.\n- All scores for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Specific analysis:\n\n**1. Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is straightforward configuration.\n- No issues found.\n- Security risk score: 0, appropriate.\n\n**2. Report 2:**\n- Similar conclusion.\n- No suspicious activity.\n- Security risk score: 0, appropriate.\n\n**3. Report 3:**\n- Same findings.\n- No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- Security risk score: 0, appropriate.\n\n**4. Report 4:**\n- Consistent with previous findings.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n- Security risk score: 0, appropriate.\n\n**5. Report 5:**\n- Same straightforward configuration.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Security risk score: 0, appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, static configuration constants.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is justified.\n- The obfuscated scores are all zero, as expected.\n- The overall security risk scores are zero, matching the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as the code is a simple configuration with no security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe configuration snippet with no malicious or suspicious activity.",
