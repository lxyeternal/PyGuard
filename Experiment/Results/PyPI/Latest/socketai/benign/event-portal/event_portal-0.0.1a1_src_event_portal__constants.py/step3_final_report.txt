  "purpose": "Defines static configuration constants for an HTTP client using the httpx library, including headers, timeouts, retries, and connection limits.",
  "sources": "Constants such as RAW_RESPONSE_HEADER, OVERRIDE_CAST_TO_HEADER, and configuration objects like DEFAULT_TIMEOUT, DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES, DEFAULT_CONNECTION_LIMITS.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process user input or external data.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple set of configuration constants for an HTTP client, with no dynamic input, data processing, or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, aligning with the code's benign nature. The code's structure and content are consistent with a standard setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static configuration for an HTTP client, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
