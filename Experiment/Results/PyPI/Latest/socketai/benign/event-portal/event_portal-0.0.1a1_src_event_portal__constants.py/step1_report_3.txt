  "purpose": "Define constants and import necessary modules for making HTTP requests in an OpenAPI client implementation.",
  "sources": "Import of httpx library; constants for HTTP headers, timeout settings, retry limits, and connection limits.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, user input, or external data processing observed; constants are static.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow involving untrusted inputs or sensitive data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward setup of HTTP client parameters without unusual patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports httpx, a standard HTTP client library, and defines several configuration constants such as headers, timeout, retries, and connection limits. These are typical for setting up HTTP request behavior. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The constants appear to be safe defaults for API communication. The file does not include any network calls, data processing, or user input handling, and there are no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for an HTTP client with configuration constants; there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
