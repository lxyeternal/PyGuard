  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration settings for an HTTP client based on the httpx library, generated from an OpenAPI spec.",
  "sources": "Constants are set directly within the code; no external data sources or input reading present.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or output functions are included.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward constant definitions with no suspicious code or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes configuration constants for an HTTP client, including headers, timeouts, retries, and connection limits. All variables are hardcoded values. No user input, external data, or untrusted sources are processed. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code segments are present. The code appears to be a standard configuration setup for an HTTP client library. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious side effects are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration snippet for an HTTP client with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely defines constants for use elsewhere. It is safe and non-malicious.",
