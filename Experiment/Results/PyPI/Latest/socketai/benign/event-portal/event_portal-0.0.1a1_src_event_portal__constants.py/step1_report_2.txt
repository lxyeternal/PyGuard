{
  "purpose": "The code defines constants and configuration settings for making HTTP requests using the httpx library, likely as part of an API client or service.",
  "sources": "The code imports the httpx library; defines string constants for headers; sets default timeout, retries, and connection limits.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks are explicitly present; the code sets configuration parameters for HTTP requests but does not handle untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "The code establishes configuration parameters that would be used in HTTP request functions elsewhere, not shown here.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. All constants appear standard for HTTP client configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining configuration constants for HTTP requests, including headers, timeouts, retries, and connection limits. No input/output handling, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present. It appears to be boilerplate setup for an API client. No malicious or malicious-sounding behavior detected. No anomalies or malicious activities evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard configuration for an HTTP client setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is unlikely to be malicious or dangerous.",
