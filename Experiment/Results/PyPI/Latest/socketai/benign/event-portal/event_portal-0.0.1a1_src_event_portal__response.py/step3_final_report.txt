{
  "purpose": "The code provides a comprehensive framework for handling HTTP responses, including parsing, streaming, and response wrapping, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous operations with custom response types.",
  "sources": "External HTTP responses (`httpx.Response`), request parameters such as `extra_headers`, `response_cls`, and response content streams.",
  "sinks": "Response content data, headers, and optional file outputs; headers are manipulated to control response modes.",
  "flows": "Response data flows from `http_response` into parsing functions, streaming iterators, or file writers; header modifications influence response processing modes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Header manipulations are standard for response control, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured response handling library supporting various response types and streaming modes. Wrapper functions modify headers to specify response behavior, which is typical in API clients. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data exfiltration. Response parsing handles JSON, text, bytes, and custom models securely. The header manipulations do not indicate malicious intent but are used for response mode control. The overall logic is consistent, and no anomalies suggest malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure response management utility with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. It employs standard practices for response parsing, streaming, and wrapper functions, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The minor risk score reflects typical response handling complexity without security concerns.",
