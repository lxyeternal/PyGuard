  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles HTTP responses, including streaming, parsing, and custom response types. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Source/Sink:** Response content from external servers; no indication of data exfiltration or code execution.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Wrapper functions modify headers to control response behavior, but these are standard practices. No obfuscation, secrets, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Low security risk, no malware, no malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is a typical response handling library with no signs of malicious activity. Malware score: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Risk: 0.2 (due to potential misuse, but unlikely).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code manages responses, streaming, and response parsing, with no malicious patterns.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Wrapper functions manipulate headers to control response modes; no evidence of data leaks or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Low risk, no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No malware or obfuscation. Risk score remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on response management, parsing, streaming, and utility wrappers. No suspicious activity.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Uses headers to influence response handling; standard practice. No hidden behaviors.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, well-structured code, no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is valid. No malware detected. Risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar analysis; response parsing, streaming, and wrapping are standard. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No backdoors, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Low security risk, no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-reasoned, consistent with previous reports.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on response handling, parsing, streaming, with no malicious intent.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Minimal risk, no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the previous reports.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently find no evidence of malicious behavior. The code primarily manages response parsing, streaming, and request wrapping, which are standard for an API client library.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected across reports.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the standard nature of the code, the potential for misuse via header manipulation is minimal, but the use of headers to control response behavior could be misused if combined with malicious server behavior. Still, there's no direct evidence of malicious intent.\n\n### **Final Expert Evaluation:**\n\n| Aspect | Estimated Score | Justification |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Malware** | **0.0** | No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration. The code is standard response handling. |\n| **Obfuscated** | **0.0** | Clear, well-structured code with no obfuscation patterns. |\n| **Risk** | **0.2** | Slightly elevated due to header manipulations that could influence server responses or be misused if the server is malicious. However, no direct malicious activity is present. |\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical, well-structured HTTP response handling library with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minor risk score accounts for potential misuse of header manipulations but does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2  \n\nThe code appears safe, with standard practices and no malicious behavior detected.",
