  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues are valid, if the reasoning is sound, and whether the scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** The report states the code handles HTTP responses, parsing, streaming, and response wrapping. Sources are external HTTP responses and user parameters; sinks are response content, headers, and files.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code modifies headers (`stream`, `raw`, `OVERRIDE_CAST_TO_HEADER`) to influence response handling, but these are standard practices for API wrappers.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report concludes low risk, no malware, and no malicious behavior, with high confidence (0.9).\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is a standard, well-structured response handling library. No malware or malicious intent detected.\n\n**Score suggestions:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Security risk: 0.2 (low, given the header manipulations are typical)  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar response handling functions, with potential for writing data to files and response parsing.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; no backdoors or code injection. The header modifications are typical for controlling streaming behavior.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is standard, with no malicious behavior, high confidence (0.9).\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The header modifications do not indicate malicious intent but are standard for such utilities.\n\n**Score suggestions:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.2 (again, typical response handling)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Focuses on response parsing, streaming, and utility wrappers. Data flows from responses into parsing or file writing.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of backdoors, secrets, or obfuscation. Wrapper functions modify headers to control response modes, which is common.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior, low risk, high confidence (0.9).\n\n- **Assessment:** The code appears legitimate and secure.\n\n**Score suggestions:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar response handling, with focus on safe parsing and streaming.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation. The code is standard for API response management.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity, low risk, high confidence (0.9).\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malware or sabotage.\n\n**Score suggestions:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Response parsing, streaming, and utility functions. Data flows from responses into parsing, writing, or streaming.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. Header modifications are typical for controlling response modes.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Secure, standard response handling, no malicious behavior, very high confidence (0.95).\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is legitimate, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Score suggestions:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.1 (minimal, standard response handling)\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions—no code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign a low risk (~0.2), which seems reasonable given the code's purpose and the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My final estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malware or malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1 - 0.2** — minimal, typical response handling complexity, no significant security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, secure implementation for HTTP response handling with no evident security risks or malicious intent.",
