  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code handles HTTP responses, parsing JSON/text, streaming, and custom response types. Sources include external responses (`httpx.Response`) and user parameters (`extra_headers`, `response_cls`).\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Response data flows from `http_response` into parsing/streaming functions; headers are manipulated to control response behavior.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; the code modifies headers like `'stream'`, `'raw'`, and `'OVERRIDE_CAST_TO_HEADER'` to influence response handling, which is standard for API clients. No obfuscated code or malicious logic. Wrapper functions are safe, mainly altering request headers.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a structured, secure response handling utility. No malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = low (0.2). These are reasonable given the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus on response handling, parsing, streaming, and response wrapping. Sources are `httpx.Response` and request parameters.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Response data can be written to files; headers are manipulated to support streaming modes.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity. Header modifications are typical for streaming control. No obfuscation or malicious patterns. The code is standard for an API client.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or malicious intent. The code is safe and well-structured.\n\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with emphasis on response parsing, streaming, and utility wrappers. Sources are response objects and request parameters.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Response data is parsed, streamed, or written to files; headers are manipulated for streaming modes.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation. The header modifications are standard practice for controlling response modes.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a typical, secure response handling framework with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on response management, parsing, streaming, and response wrapping. Sources are response objects and request parameters.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Response data flows into parsing, file writing, or streaming functions. Wrappers modify headers to control response modes.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The header manipulations are standard for API clients. No hidden behaviors.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, with no malware or malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar response handling, parsing, streaming, and utility functions. Sources are response objects and request parameters.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Response data into parsing, file writing, or streaming; headers are manipulated for control.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code is standard for an API response handler.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no malware detected.\n\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe a comprehensive, well-structured HTTP response handling library supporting sync/async, streaming, custom response types, and response parsing. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n- **Potential Risks:** The only minor concern is the header manipulation (`RAW_RESPONSE_HEADER`, `OVERRIDE_CAST_TO_HEADER`) which influences response processing but is standard practice for API clients. No actual malicious activity is indicated.\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there are no signs of malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and well-structured.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly higher (0.1-0.2) due to the header manipulations, but overall low.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, structured code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (standard response handling with header manipulations)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malicious intent. The response handling, wrapper functions, and response parsing logic are typical for an API client library. No supply chain or security threat is evident from this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is secure, well-structured, and appropriate for its purpose. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
