  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes response handling, parsing, streaming, and response wrapping.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious data flow, no obfuscation, no code injection, secrets, or backdoors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a secure, well-structured library for response handling. Wrapper functions modify headers to control response modes but do not execute untrusted code. No malware or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 (low), confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The logic is sound, and no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus on response handling, streaming, and response parsing.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or backdoors. Header modifications are standard for controlling streaming behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity. The code is standard for API response management.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns. The code appears safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on response management, including streaming and custom response classes.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior. The code handles responses securely.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Response handling, parsing, streaming, and utility wrappers.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. Header modifications are typical for controlling response modes.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious activity; response handling is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Response management, parsing, streaming, resource handling.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No malicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a secure, standard response handling module.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, consistent with the code's purpose.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero, mainly due to the header modifications for streaming control, but these are standard practices in API client libraries.\n- **Confidence:** High across all reports.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, well-structured code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, mainly due to header manipulations which are typical for such libraries)\n\n**Note:** The code is a typical, well-structured API response handling library with no evident security risks or malicious behavior. The wrapper functions and response parsing are standard and do not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the detailed reviews, I agree with the assessments that the code is secure, with no malware or obfuscation, and a very low security risk. The overall scores should remain at or near zero for malware and obfuscated, with a minimal risk score (~0.1–0.2).",
