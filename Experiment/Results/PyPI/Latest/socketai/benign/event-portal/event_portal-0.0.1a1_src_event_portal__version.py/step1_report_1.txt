  "anomalies": "Code appears to be auto-generated or boilerplate with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple declaration of package metadata, likely generated by a tool (Stainless). It contains no input reading, no data processing, no external communications, and no dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code's structure and content are typical for auto-generated metadata files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a metadata declaration for the package. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
