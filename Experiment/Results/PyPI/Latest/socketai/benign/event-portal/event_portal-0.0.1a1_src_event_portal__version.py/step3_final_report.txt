  "purpose": "Declare package metadata (__title__ and __version__) for a Python package, likely auto-generated from an OpenAPI spec.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments (__title__, __version__), no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignments with no dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated metadata without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata, with no input, data flow, or external communication. It appears to be auto-generated boilerplate, standard for Python packages derived from OpenAPI specs. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is benign, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The current assessment and scores accurately reflect its benign nature. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
