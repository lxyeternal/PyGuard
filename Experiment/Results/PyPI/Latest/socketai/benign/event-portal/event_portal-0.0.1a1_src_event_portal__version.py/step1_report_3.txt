{
  "purpose": "Metadata definition for a Python package or module, likely part of an API client or server",
  "sources": "Assignment of string literals to __title__ and __version__ variables",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; code simply assigns static string values to variables",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata variables __title__ and __version__ with static strings, which is standard practice. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscated code, or side effects are present. The code is minimal and conventional for package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of metadata declarations typical for Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
