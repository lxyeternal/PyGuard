  "purpose": "Metadata assignment for a Python package or module, specifying the package title and version.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data read operations are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be straightforward metadata declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two string variables, __title__ and __version__, which are standard for Python package metadata. There are no input operations, no external data reads, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic. The comment indicates generated code from an OpenAPI specification via Stainless, but this does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is minimal, standard, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple metadata declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
