  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple set of variable assignments for package metadata (__title__ and __version__).\n   - There are no input sources, data flows, or external communications.\n   - The code appears to be auto-generated boilerplate, with no suspicious or malicious constructs.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and there are no issues or vulnerabilities present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flows, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports and the code itself show no signs of malicious activity, the risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n   - No justification exists for higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward observations: static variable assignments, no data flow, no external communication.\n   - No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made without evidence.\n   - The analysis is appropriate and cautious.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is purely boilerplate metadata declaration, generated automatically, with no malicious or suspicious content. The scores assigned are appropriate, and there are no indications of security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the provided reports.",
