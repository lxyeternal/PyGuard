  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   The code snippets are straightforward variable assignments setting `__title__` and `__version__`. All reports correctly identify that there are no input sources, data flows, or external communications. There are no signs of dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The code appears to be auto-generated metadata declarations for a Python package, which is standard practice.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of suspicious activity, dynamic behavior, or security risks. No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Malware: 0\n   - SecurityRisk: 0\n\n   These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n   Since all reports agree that the code is benign with no malicious intent, the risk scores should remain at 0. The malware score is also correctly set to 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   The reports do not rely on assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as boilerplate metadata declarations with no suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \n   The scores are consistent and appropriate. The high confidence and zero malware/security risk scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary of My Own Estimate:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final Justification:**  \nAll evidence points to this code being simple, auto-generated package metadata. It does not perform any actions, handle untrusted data, or contain any suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports are correct and should remain as-is.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, and the current scoring accurately reflects its benign nature.",
