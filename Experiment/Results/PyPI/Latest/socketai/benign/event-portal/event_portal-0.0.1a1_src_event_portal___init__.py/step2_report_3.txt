  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward module setup script, importing internal components, setting __all__, and adjusting __module__ attributes. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** No signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high certainty).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a typical package initializer with no suspicious patterns or external data handling.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** No indicators.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, aligns with the benign analysis.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Also describes a standard SDK setup with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** None detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, consistent with the benign description.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—initial setup, imports, logging, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** No issues.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Standard package initialization with no external input or suspicious operations.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** None.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is purely for package setup and import management.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any suspicious patterns, external data handling, or malicious indicators, a risk score of **0** is justified.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a typical Python package initialization script, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment.\n- The code does not perform any network operations, handle sensitive data, or execute dynamic code.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
