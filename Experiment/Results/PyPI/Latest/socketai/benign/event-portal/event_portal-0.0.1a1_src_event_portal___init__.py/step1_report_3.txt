{
  "purpose": "This code is part of an SDK or client library that interfaces with an API, managing dependencies, importing modules, and setting up logging and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (e.g., .types, ._client, ._models), environment variables indirectly via imported classes (e.g., ENVIRONMENTS), and the logging setup function.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data are present. No data leaks or security-sensitive operations are observed.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and sets module attributes, with no runtime data flow involving untrusted input or sensitive data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. All imports and setups are typical for a client SDK. The logging setup is standard. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or network operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages imports, module exports, and configuration for a client library. It performs no data processing, network communication, or system modifications. The logging setup and module attribute adjustments are routine. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization script for an SDK, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and legitimate, focused on organizing and exporting components of a client library.",
