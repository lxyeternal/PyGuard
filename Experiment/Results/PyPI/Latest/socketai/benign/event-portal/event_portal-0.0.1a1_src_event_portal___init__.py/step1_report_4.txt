{
  "purpose": "This code defines and imports various modules, classes, constants, and error handlers for a Python SDK related to an event portal API. It sets up logging, manages exports, and updates module attributes.",
  "sources": "Code imports modules and attributes from internal package files; no external data inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily imports and configures internal components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The setup_logging call is standard, and all imports are from local package modules.",
  "analysis": "The code performs initial setup for a Python package, including importing modules, setting up __all__, and updating __module__ attributes for better error messages. No user input, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be standard package boilerplate for managing exports and internal setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script with no malicious or suspicious components detected. It only manages module imports, exports, and logging setup, with no signs of malware, data leaks, or security issues.",
