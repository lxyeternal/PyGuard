  "purpose": "The code provides a utility class for parsing and serializing URL query strings with customizable array and nested formats.",
  "sources": "Input data from method parameters (params, query string input), environment variables are not used.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the 'urlencode' function which serializes parameters into a URL query string; however, it only processes sanitized data. No direct output to network or system affected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method parameters through serialization functions; user input is parsed via 'parse_qs', then reconstructed or serialized via 'stringify' and '_stringify_item'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors observed. The code appears to follow standard serialization/deserialization logic. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions for parsing and stringifying URL query parameters with customizable formats. It uses well-known libraries like 'urllib.parse' and standard Python types. No user input is directly executed as code, and the functions do not perform network operations or system modifications. No malicious patterns or privacy leaks detected. The code structure is straightforward, with no suspicious dynamic execution, obfuscated parts, or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for handling URL query strings without malicious intent or security risks. There are no indications of malware or malicious behavior based on its content and structure.",
