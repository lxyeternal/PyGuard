  "purpose": "Provides utilities for parsing and serializing URL query strings with support for nested data and various array formats.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to parse and stringify methods, including query string strings and parameter dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Uses standard library functions `parse_qs` and `urlencode` for parsing and serialization; these are safe functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input strings or parameter dictionaries through parsing or serialization functions, resulting in output strings or data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. The incomplete support for 'indices' array format is explicitly noted as a feature gap, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward URL query string utility leveraging standard Python libraries. It handles nested structures and multiple array formats with configurable options. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The security posture is minimal risk, with scores reflecting the benign nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The code's design and implementation are clear and standard, with no suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for URL query string parsing and serialization. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The minor risk score accounts for potential misuse in untrusted contexts but does not indicate actual vulnerabilities.",
