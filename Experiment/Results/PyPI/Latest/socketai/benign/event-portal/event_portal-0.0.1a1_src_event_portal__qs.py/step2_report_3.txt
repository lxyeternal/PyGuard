  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a URL query string utility, standard use of `urllib.parse`, no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified as no malicious activity.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, slightly above zero but justified by minimal potential misuses (e.g., malformed input leading to issues). Given the lack of dangerous operations, this seems reasonable.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation.\n- **Score justification:** Overall consistent; no issues.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, standard URL query string handling, safe use of standard libraries.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified.\n- **Risk score:** 0, no evident vulnerabilities.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Score justification:** Consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility class with safe operations, no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1, very low, justified as the code handles data safely.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Score justification:** Appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard URL query string handling, incomplete support for some formats, but no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, acceptable given incomplete features but no security risk.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Score justification:** Reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, standard, safe, no malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Score justification:** Appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, matching the reports' claims. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low, justified by the nature of URL handling code.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across the board — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** Given the code's purpose and the analysis, I would assign a risk score of approximately **0.1** at most, mainly due to potential for misuse if untrusted data is fed into URL encoding, but overall very low.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:** The reports are consistent, and the code appears safe and well-implemented. No further action needed.",
