  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured data modeling utility built on Pydantic, with no signs of malicious activity or backdoors. The use of environment variables and override methods are standard practices for SDKs and do not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to configuration flexibility, which is acceptable."
