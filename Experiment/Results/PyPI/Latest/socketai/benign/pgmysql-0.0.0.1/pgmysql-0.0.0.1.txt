      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues. The empty author fields are typical for placeholders and do not constitute a security concern. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero. The only minor adjustment is to set the securityRisk score to 0 across all reports, as the slight elevation in one report (0.1) is unwarranted given the benign nature of the code."
