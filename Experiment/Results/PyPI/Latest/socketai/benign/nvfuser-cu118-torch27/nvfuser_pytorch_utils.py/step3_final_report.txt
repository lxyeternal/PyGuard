{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for GPU device property retrieval, data type mapping, and error handling within a CUDA-enabled PyTorch environment.",
  "sources": "Reads device properties via ctypes and torch.cuda APIs; maps Python and torch data types to internal DataType enum.",
  "sinks": "No external data exfiltration, network activity, or untrusted data sinks; internal system and library calls only.",
  "flows": "Uses ctypes to load CUDA libraries, retrieves device attributes, and maps data types; no external data flow or user input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected; standard use of ctypes and system APIs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate hardware querying and data type conversions, with proper error handling for CUDA library loading and device attribute retrieval. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leaks. The use of ctypes is standard for low-level hardware access. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and serves typical utility functions in GPU-accelerated applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for CUDA device info and data type management. It shows no malicious or suspicious behavior, with appropriate low risk and obfuscation scores. The overall security assessment is that it is safe for use in production environments.",
