  "purpose": "Define a lazy-import wrapper for packaging.version.Version and a class NvfuserVersion for version comparison and handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class initializations, method calls to import packaging.version, and usage of _version_str.",
  "sinks": "get_cls method calls import.packaging.version, __call__ method invokes get_cls, and __version__ assignment uses _version_str.",
  "flows": "import.packaging.version in get_cls -> get_cls() in __call__ -> __version__ initialized with _version_str -> methods manipulating Version objects",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. Lazy importing is common for optional dependencies; no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code lazily imports packaging.version to avoid unnecessary dependency loading, defines a version comparison class, and assigns a version string to __version__. No external input or untrusted data flows are evident. The code performs version parsing and comparison, which is standard. The only potential concern is the import logic, but it is a benign fallback mechanism. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of lazy-importing and version handling without any malicious intent. No malicious or security risk signals detected.",
