  "purpose": "Provides a lazy import wrapper for packaging.version.Version and a custom version class for comparison operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements for packaging.version and pkg_resources; class methods that process version strings and objects.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Version string input -> _LazyImport returns Version class -> NvfuserVersion converts and compares versions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambdas for operator overloading with default arguments captures the loop variable correctly; fallback import from pkg_resources is standard but slightly unconventional in modern Python.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard lazy import pattern for an optional dependency, with a custom class for version comparison. No external inputs, network activity, or system modifications are present. The dynamic operator assignment is a known pattern and does not introduce security issues. The fallback import from pkg_resources is common for vendored dependencies. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 or 0) are justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for version handling with lazy import, showing no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
