  "purpose": "This code contains only licensing comments with no executable code or data handling.",
  "sources": "Comments in the code, specifically the copyright and license statements.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present, as there is no active code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist due to the absence of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the future year \"2025\" in the copyright statement, which appears to be a placeholder or typo.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely comments with licensing information; no code, data flow, or suspicious patterns are present. The anomaly of the future year does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0. Confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty. The scores are consistent with the benign analysis. The anomaly does not impact security assessment but may be corrected in production code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of licensing comments. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores are appropriate, and the high confidence levels are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
