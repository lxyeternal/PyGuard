  "purpose": "Define a file-level variable 'cmake_prefix_path' for locating a specific directory related to NVIDIA's nvfuser build/share structure.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), os.path.join() functions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or security issues",
  "flows": "Input (__file__) → os.path.dirname() → os.path.join() → variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or obfuscated code. The code simply constructs a directory path based on the current file location.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and defines a variable 'cmake_prefix_path' that constructs a path by navigating two directories up from the current file and appending a fixed subpath related to NVIDIA's nvfuser. This is a standard approach for locating resources relative to the script location. No user input, environment variables, or external network calls are involved. The SPDX license comments are standard licensing declarations, not malicious. The code is straightforward and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module that defines a path variable for internal use. There are no signs of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It simply constructs a directory path based on the script's location.",
