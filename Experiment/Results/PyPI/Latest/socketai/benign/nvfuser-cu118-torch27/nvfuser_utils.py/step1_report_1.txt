  "purpose": "Define a file path for the 'nvfuser' cmake prefix directory based on the current file's location.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)), and __file__",
  "sinks": "None present; no data is transmitted or stored in a manner that leads to leaks or security issues",
  "flows": "Path construction from __file__ through os.path functions to define cmake_prefix_path",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward path concatenation without suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and constructs a directory path by ascending two levels from the current file's location, then appends specific subdirectory components related to 'nvfuser'. The path is assigned to a variable and exposed via __all__. There are no input sources from external or untrusted data, no data sinks, nor any unusual code patterns. The code appears to be a standard setup for locating resource directories.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple, benign path configuration setup without malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data or perform any suspicious actions.",
