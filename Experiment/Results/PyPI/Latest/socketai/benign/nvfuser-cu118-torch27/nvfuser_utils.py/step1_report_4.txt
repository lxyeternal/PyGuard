  "purpose": "Define a variable for a specific directory path related to 'nvfuser' within the project structure.",
  "sources": "Reading the current file's directory using os.path.dirname(__file__). and constructing a path with os.path.join().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output operations present.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a directory path based on the location of the current file; no data flows to external systems or untrusted destinations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; standard path construction.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, defines an exported list '__all__' containing 'cmake_prefix_path', and sets this variable by joining parts of the directory structure relative to the current file. There are no user inputs, no network operations, no credential handling, or other security-sensitive operations. The code appears to be a simple configuration setup. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, defining a directory path for configuration purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign setup script for locating resources within a project.",
