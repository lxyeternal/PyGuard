{
  "purpose": "Constructs a filesystem path to the 'nvfuser' resource directory relative to the current file location.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file path via __file__ and uses os.path functions to navigate directories.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sinks are involved; the code only performs path concatenation.",
  "flows": "The source (__file__) is used to generate the path stored in cmake_prefix_path without any data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, defines an __all__ list, and constructs a path by ascending two directories from __file__ and appending specific subdirectories. It performs no input validation, network activity, or code execution. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, and confidence is high. There are no anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard resource path setup with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
