  "purpose": "Define a file-scoped variable for a specific directory path related to 'nvfuser' within the package.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__))",
  "sinks": "os.path.join() to construct a filesystem path",
  "flows": "Input (__file__) -> os.path.dirname() -> os.path.join() -> cmake_prefix_path",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code simply constructs a filesystem path.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'os' module and defines a variable 'cmake_prefix_path' that joins parts of directory paths based on the current file's location. It includes SPDX license identifiers and copyright notices, which are common in open-source projects. There are no functions executing untrusted input, network activity, or code injection. The path construction appears straightforward and safe, intended to locate files relative to the current script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious path construction snippet with no suspicious or malicious behavior. It is part of a standard open-source setup for locating resources. No malware or security risks are detected.",
