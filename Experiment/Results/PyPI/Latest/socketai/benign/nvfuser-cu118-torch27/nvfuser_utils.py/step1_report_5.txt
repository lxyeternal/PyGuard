{
  "purpose": "Defines a path variable for a specific directory within the package, likely used for locating CMake configuration files related to NVIDIA's nvfuser component.",
  "sources": "Reads the current file's directory (__file__), then traverses parent directories to build a path to a specific share directory within the project.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Uses __file__ to determine directory locations, then constructs a path; no data flows from external sources to sinks with potential security implications.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements detected. The code simply constructs a filesystem path.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and defines a list __all__ for exports. It then constructs a path by joining parts of the directory structure relative to the current file (__file__). The approach is standard for locating resource directories in a project. There are no input validation, dynamic execution, or security-sensitive operations. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward directory path construction for locating resources related to NVIDIA's nvfuser component. There is no malicious intent or security concern detected.",
