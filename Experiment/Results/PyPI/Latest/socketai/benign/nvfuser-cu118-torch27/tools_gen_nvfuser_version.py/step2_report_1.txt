  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code behavior, assessing the reasoning, and evaluating the scores.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports describe the code as a build/version management script that interacts with Git, environment variables, files, and subprocesses.\n- No report mentions suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- The subprocess calls are straightforward, invoking standard commands (`git`, `python -c ...`) for configuration queries.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- The code relies on environment variables and external commands, which is typical for such scripts.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across reports, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.1–0.2), which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily about version info retrieval, environment querying, and file writing, with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning?**  \n  No. The reports correctly interpret the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which is justified. The risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they interpret the code as standard build scripts. This is accurate.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. Given the benign behavior, the scores are appropriate. The confidence levels are high (~0.9–0.95), reflecting strong certainty.\n\n- **Should any scores be adjusted?**  \n  No. The scores seem well-calibrated.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for scores higher than 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk or malware score above 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity, nor does it have vulnerabilities that would justify higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, standard build script behavior)\n\n### My own estimate:\nConsidering all the evidence, I agree with the provided scores. The code is a standard, transparent version/configuration utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Code is legitimate and benign.**  \n- **No malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity detected.**  \n- **Scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.**\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1–0.2.",
