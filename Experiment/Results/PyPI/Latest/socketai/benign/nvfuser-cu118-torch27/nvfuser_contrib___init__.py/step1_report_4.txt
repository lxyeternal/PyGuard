{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports a submodule named 'nn' and exposes it publicly.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from . import nn' indicating it reads the local submodule 'nn'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "The only flow is the import of the 'nn' module, which is then made available through '__all__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module with a relative import of 'nn'. It declares '__all__' to specify the public API. There are no data inputs, outputs, or complex logic. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py file or a module exposing submodules.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign module initialization code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
