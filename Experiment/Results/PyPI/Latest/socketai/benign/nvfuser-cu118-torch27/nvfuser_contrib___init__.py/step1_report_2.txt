  "purpose": "Define and export the 'nn' module from the current package for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from . import nn' and the __all__ list defining export.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import statement provides access to internal module 'nn'. No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a package-level import and an explicit __all__ export list. It does not process user input, handle sensitive data, or perform any operations that could be malicious. The import is relative and standard, with no indications of malicious intent. The __all__ list simply exposes the 'nn' module for public use, which is common practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module export statement with no malicious or suspicious elements. It appears to be part of a larger package, exporting 'nn' for external use without any harmful behavior.",
