  "purpose": "This code defines the public API for a package or module, specifically exposing the 'nn' submodule.",
  "sources": "The code imports the local 'nn' module and assigns it to __all__ to make it publicly accessible.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data processing in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted input to sink paths is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no unusual patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local submodule 'nn' and specifies it in __all__ for public access, following standard Python packaging conventions. There are no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, and no suspicious behavior. The comments are licensing statements, which are common and benign. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, standard module initialization file with no malicious intent or security concerns. It merely exposes the 'nn' submodule for external use, with no indication of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
