{
  "purpose": "Export the 'nn' module for external use in a package, likely related to neural network functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from . import nn'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Import statement simply makes 'nn' available; no data flow analysis needed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module 'nn' and sets '__all__' to expose 'nn' for external modules. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, or external communication. The content appears to be a standard package __init__.py pattern for re-exporting modules. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module initialization script that re-exports a local 'nn' module. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.",
