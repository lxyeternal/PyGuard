  "purpose": "Defines an export list for the module, exposing the 'nn' submodule.",
  "sources": "The import statement from '.' (relative import), and the '__all__' list assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or exported.",
  "flows": "The import of 'nn' and the assignment to '__all__' are straightforward; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module-level script that imports a submodule 'nn' from the current package and explicitly declares it for export via '__all__'. There is no execution of untrusted input, dynamic code, or malicious patterns. The structure and content are standard for Python package modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard module export definition with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
