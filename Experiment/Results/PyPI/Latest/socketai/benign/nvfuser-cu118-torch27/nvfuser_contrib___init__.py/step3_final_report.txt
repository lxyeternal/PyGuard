{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization or export file, exposing the 'nn' submodule for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local package structure via the relative import 'from . import nn'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the import statement to the __all__ declaration, with no data manipulation or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains only standard import and export statements with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports a submodule 'nn' and declares it in __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no dynamic code execution, no untrusted input handling, no network activity, and no obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as a benign, standard pattern with no malicious intent. The assigned scores (malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, risk=0.0, confidence=1.0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign module initialization pattern with no security risks or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
