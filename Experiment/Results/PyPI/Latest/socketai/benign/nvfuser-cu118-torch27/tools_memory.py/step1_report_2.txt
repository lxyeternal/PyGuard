{
  "purpose": "Retrieve available system memory in gigabytes, primarily for resource management or monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading from psutil.virtual_memory() and /proc/meminfo file to gather system memory data.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; the data retrieved is used internally and returned as a numerical value.",
  "flows": "Input from system libraries and files flows into calculations, then the result is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard system memory retrieval code with fallback methods.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to determine available system memory using the psutil library. If psutil is unavailable or fails, it falls back to reading /proc/meminfo directly. Both methods parse system memory info without any modification or injection. The code handles exceptions silently and defaults to returning 0, which is a common approach for such utility functions. There are no indications of malicious intent, hidden behavior, or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility to fetch system available memory in GB, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It employs standard techniques and safe practices.",
