  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The function `get_available_memory_gb()` retrieves system available memory.\n- It uses `psutil.virtual_memory().available` if `psutil` is available.\n- If not, it reads `/proc/meminfo` to extract `MemAvailable`.\n- Both methods are standard for system memory detection.\n- Exception handling is broad (`except: pass`), which can mask errors but is common in such utility functions.\n- The function ultimately returns a float representing available memory in GB or 0 if both methods fail.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code?**  \n  No, the code appears to be a benign utility. No obfuscated code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The broad exception handling (`except: pass`) could hide errors, but this is a common pattern in system info functions. No malicious intent or suspicious logic is evident.\n\n- **Scores Given in Reports:**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0.1 or 0\n  \n  These seem reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Risk Scores > 0.5?**  \n  No, all are below 0.5, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n\n- **Malware Score Justification:**  \n  The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Claims Based on Assumptions?**  \n  No, all reports base their conclusions on the code's behavior, which is straightforward.\n\n- **Consistency of Scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies noted.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-understood utility function for system memory detection.\n- No obfuscation, no malicious logic, no network activity.\n- The only concern is the broad exception handling, which is a known pattern but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n- 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n- 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n- Given the benign nature, I would assign a risk score of **0.1** to reflect the broad exception handling but no significant security concern.\n\n**Additional Notes:**  \n- The function could be improved by handling exceptions more specifically and logging errors, but this does not affect security.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimated Score |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                     |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                     |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1                   |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a safe, standard utility with no malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate; I agree with the provided assessments.",
