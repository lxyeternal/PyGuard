  "purpose": "Retrieve available system memory in GB using psutil or /proc/meminfo.",
  "sources": "Import of psutil module; reading /proc/meminfo file.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication; purely local system info retrieval.",
  "flows": "psutil.virtual_memory().available or reading lines from /proc/meminfo to extract MemAvailable value.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling (except: pass), which suppresses errors silently.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility function to get available memory. It first attempts to use psutil, a common system library, and falls back to reading /proc/meminfo if psutil is unavailable. Exception handling is broad, which could hide errors but is typical in such utility functions. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activity is present. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or contain hardcoded secrets. The overall behavior is benign and standard for system info retrieval. The broad exception handling is a minor operational concern but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility function with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The broad exception handling could hide errors but does not pose a security threat. The current malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 due to error suppression practices. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for supply chain use.",
