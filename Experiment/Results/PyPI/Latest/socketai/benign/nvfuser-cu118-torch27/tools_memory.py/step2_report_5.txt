  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The function `get_available_memory_gb()` attempts to determine available system memory in GB.\n- It uses `psutil.virtual_memory().available` if `psutil` is available.\n- If `psutil` isn't available or an error occurs, it reads `/proc/meminfo` to parse `MemAvailable`.\n- Exception handling is broad (`except: pass`), which suppresses errors silently.\n- No obfuscation, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is straightforward, and the reported issues (broad exception handling, standard system calls) are accurately identified.\n- **Malicious code or behavior:** No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Data leaks or external communication:** None.\n- **Hardcoded secrets:** None.\n- **Suspicious logic:** None, just standard system info retrieval.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Analysis of Reports:\n\n#### **Report 1-5 (Common themes):**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard utility for fetching available memory.\n- The use of broad exception handling is noted but not considered malicious.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The confidence scores are high (0.9-1), which seems reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are all 0, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1), justified by the silent exception handling, which could mask errors but doesn't pose a direct security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations on scores:\n\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware:** Correctly 0, no malicious activity.\n- **Risk:** Given the code's benign purpose, a score of 0.1 is reasonable, perhaps slightly conservative. It could be 0, but the broad exception handling might hide errors, which could be a minor operational risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a simple, well-understood utility.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain attack vectors.\n- The exception handling, while not ideal, is common in such scripts and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Recommended Score | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **malware**     | 0                   | No malicious activity detected.                              |\n| **obfuscated**  | 0                   | Clear, straightforward code.                                |\n| **risk**        | 0.1 (or 0)        | Minor operational risk due to silent exception handling.   |\n\n**Given the evidence, I would recommend setting:**\n\n- **malware:** 0\n- **obfuscated:** 0\n- **risk:** 0 (or 0.1 if conservative)\n\n---\n\n### **Final note:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. The only minor concern is the broad exception handling, which could be improved for robustness but doesn't constitute a security risk.\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0 (or 0.1 for slight operational concern)",
