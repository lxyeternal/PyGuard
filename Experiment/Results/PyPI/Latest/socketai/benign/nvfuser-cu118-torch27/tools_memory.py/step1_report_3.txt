{
  "purpose": "The code aims to determine the available system memory in gigabytes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'psutil' library and from the '/proc/meminfo' file.",
  "sinks": "The data is processed within the function; no untrusted data sinks such as network transmission or file writing are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system memory queries (via psutil or /proc/meminfo) into internal calculations; no external data flows or outputs are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains broad exception handling with bare 'except' clauses, which can mask errors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are evident.",
  "analysis": "The function attempts to import 'psutil' to get available memory; if unsuccessful, it reads '/proc/meminfo' directly. Both methods parse system memory info, and fallback to returning 0 if both fail. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns. The use of broad exception handling could mask errors but is not inherently malicious. No network activity, credential handling, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for retrieving available system memory. It contains no malicious intent or suspicious behavior and appears to be safe.",
