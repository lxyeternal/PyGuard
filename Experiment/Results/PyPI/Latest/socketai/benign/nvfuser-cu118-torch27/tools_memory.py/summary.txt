  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility function with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The broad exception handling could hide errors but does not pose a security threat. The current malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 due to error suppression practices. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for supply chain use."
