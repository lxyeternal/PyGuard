{
  "purpose": "Retrieve available system memory in gigabytes using psutil or /proc/meminfo as fallback.",
  "sources": "Importing psutil module, reading from /proc/meminfo file",
  "sinks": "Potentially exposing system memory info, but only locally and without external output",
  "flows": "Import psutil -> call psutil.virtual_memory().available -> fallback to /proc/meminfo read -> return memory value",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad except clauses which suppress exceptions; no logging or alerting for failures; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to retrieve available system memory first via the psutil library, which is a common approach. If psutil is unavailable, it reads from /proc/meminfo directly. Both methods are standard for system memory detection. Exception handling is broad and silent, which could mask errors but does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility to report available system memory, employing common practices. No malicious behavior or supply chain threats are evident.",
