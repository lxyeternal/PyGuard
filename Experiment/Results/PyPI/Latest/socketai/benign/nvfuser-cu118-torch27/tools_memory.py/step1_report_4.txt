{
  "purpose": "To retrieve the available system memory in gigabytes.",
  "sources": "The code reads system memory information from the psutil library and the /proc/meminfo file.",
  "targets": "The data is returned as a float representing available memory in GB; no external data or untrusted input is directly used or affected.",
  "flows": "Input is from system resources (psutil or /proc/meminfo); output is a numerical value of available memory in GB.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception clauses (except:) can mask errors, but this is common in system info retrieval. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The function attempts to import and use psutil to get memory info, falling back to reading /proc/meminfo if psutil isn't available. Both methods parse system files to extract memory info. No external inputs, no malicious data handling. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The code is straightforward and system-specific, with error handling that suppresses exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for checking available system memory, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It simply accesses system files or libraries to retrieve memory info without any external communication or hidden functionalities.",
