{
  "purpose": "The function retrieves the amount of available system memory in GB, using either the psutil library or reading from /proc/meminfo as fallback.",
  "sources": "Importing the psutil library; reading from the file /proc/meminfo",
  "sinks": "Returning the calculated memory value; no other data sinks are present",
  "flows": "Importing psutil -> calling psutil.virtual_memory().available -> reading /proc/meminfo -> parsing and returning value",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling (except: pass), which suppresses errors and could hide malicious code or bugs; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to fetch available memory using the psutil library, and if unavailable, reads /proc/meminfo to extract the same info. Both methods are standard for system memory detection. The use of broad exception handling may mask errors, but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation, suspicious logic, or malicious code segments are present. No network activity or data exfiltration attempts are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility to determine available memory, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The broad exception handling could be improved for robustness but does not pose security risks.",
