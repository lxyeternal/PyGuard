  "sources": "The string literal '_version_str' is assigned from a hardcoded value within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks exists in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a version string with a '+git' suffix suggests version control metadata; no anomalies detected in this context.",
