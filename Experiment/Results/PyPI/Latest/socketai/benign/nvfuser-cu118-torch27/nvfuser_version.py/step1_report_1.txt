  "purpose": "Store the version string of the package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string '_version_str' to a static string value.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as only a static string assignment occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The version string includes a '+git...' suffix which indicates a build metadata tag, common in versioning but not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code, no obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version identifier to a variable, including build metadata. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks or flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious behavior. The version string format is typical for development or pre-release versions. The code is straightforward and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple assignment of a version string with build metadata. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
