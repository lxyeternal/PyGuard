  "purpose": "Assigns a static version string with build metadata to a variable.",
  "sources": "No external input; static string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static assignment with version and build info.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string including a git commit hash suffix to a variable. It contains no dynamic code, no input/output, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior. The version string with '+git...' is standard for build metadata. No malicious activity, security risks, or vulnerabilities are present. The code is benign and typical for versioning purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version string assignment with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
