{
  "purpose": "The code defines a string variable containing a version identifier, likely for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string to the variable _version_str",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process or output data beyond variable assignment",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is a simple variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a version string with a 'git' suffix could indicate embedded build information, but this alone is not suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a version string to a variable. The string includes a standard version number with a git commit hash suffix, which is common in development or pre-release versions. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as code execution, input processing, or network operations. No obfuscated code, secrets, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign code snippet used for version tracking. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
