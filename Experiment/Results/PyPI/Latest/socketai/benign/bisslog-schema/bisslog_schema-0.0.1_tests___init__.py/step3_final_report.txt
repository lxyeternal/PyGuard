  "purpose": "Assess supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, input handling, data flows, external library usage, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variable access, data leaks, system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks via function calls, data processing, or control flow constructs.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual control flow, dynamic execution, hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity. Malware scores are consistently 0, reflecting no evidence of malicious intent. Risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), appropriate given the minimal content and benign descriptions. Confidence levels range from 0.2 to 0.9, aligning with the amount of information available. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected across the reports. The reasoning in each report is consistent, and the scores are justified based on the provided evidence. The absence of code in some reports is handled cautiously with low confidence, which is appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no detectable malicious behavior or obfuscation. Scores are consistent and justified. No further adjustments are necessary.",
