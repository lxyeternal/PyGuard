  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility functions, but the exact purpose is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, function arguments, or external modules; possibly reads from files or network sources if present in the omitted parts.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to files, outputs to console, or transmits data over network connections if such code exists later in the script.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks like file I/O or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected; code appears straightforward with no obfuscated or misleading patterns; no unusual dynamic code execution observed in the provided fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and lacks suspicious constructs like eval, exec, or dynamic imports. It does not contain hardcoded credentials, malicious payloads, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard, and no signs of obfuscation are evident. Without additional context or code segments, no malicious behavior is apparent. The structure is clear, and no anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns or behaviors observed.",
