  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for criticality levels and a method to retrieve enum members based on integer values.",
  "sources": "Imports from enum and typing modules; class attributes; class method accessing class attributes and members.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'val' flows into get_from_int_val method; method accesses class attributes and members to return enum instances.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward enum definition with caching for lookups.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enum for criticality levels, with associated integer values, and provides a class method to retrieve enum members from integer inputs. It uses attribute caching to optimize repeated lookups. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code. The implementation appears to be standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe enum definition with a caching method for lookup efficiency. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It performs a standard task without malicious intent.",
