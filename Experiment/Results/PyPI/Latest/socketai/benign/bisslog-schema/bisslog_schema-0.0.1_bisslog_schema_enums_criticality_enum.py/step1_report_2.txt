{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for criticality levels with a helper method to retrieve enum members based on integer values.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; only internal class attributes and method parameters are used.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that lead to data leakage, network connections, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'val' flows into the get_from_int_val method, which performs a cache lookup and returns an enum member.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The caching mechanism is straightforward and intended for performance.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enum for criticality levels with associated integer values. The get_from_int_val method implements a caching mechanism for faster lookups of enum members based on integer inputs. The cache is created upon first invocation and stored as a class attribute. No external data is read, and no unsafe operations or obfuscated code are present. The logic appears standard and benign, with no malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple enum definition with a caching method for enum lookups. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward utility module.",
