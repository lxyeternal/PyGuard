{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for criticality levels and provides a method to retrieve enum members based on integer values.",
  "sources": "Import statements (enum, Optional); class definition; class attributes; get_from_int_val method, which reads the input parameter 'val' and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the get_from_int_val method returns enum members based on input without executing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'val' flows into the get_from_int_val method, which uses internal cache and class members to retrieve corresponding enum members.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code present. The method caches lookup results for performance but does not introduce any malicious behavior. No obfuscation or suspicious language features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard enum class with associated integer values, which is common for representing categorical states. The get_from_int_val method caches the lookup dictionary for efficiency, creating it on the first call and reusing it thereafter. This approach is typical and not malicious. The code does not execute any untrusted inputs, perform network operations, or access sensitive data. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward enumeration with a simple caching method for lookups. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues within this snippet.",
