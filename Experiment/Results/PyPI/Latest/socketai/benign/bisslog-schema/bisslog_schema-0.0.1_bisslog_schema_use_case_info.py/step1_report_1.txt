  "purpose": "Define the UseCaseInfo class to model use case metadata for a service, including triggers, criticality, and actor details.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules: bisslog_schema.entity_info, bisslog_schema.enums.criticality_enum, bisslog_schema.trigger_info; data dictionary input to from_dict method.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no use of eval, exec, or system calls; no external network operations or file I/O.",
  "flows": "from_dict method reads from input dictionary, processes triggers and criticality, constructs UseCaseInfo object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No unusual language features or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class that extends EntityInfo, including a static method to instantiate objects from a dictionary. It processes input data to populate triggers, criticality, and actor fields. Criticality is converted based on type, with enum mapping, but this is standard. No external data sources, network activity, or insecure practices are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward data model implementation without any malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on external modules for enums and entity info, but these are standard. No indicators of supply chain attack or malicious intent are observed.",
