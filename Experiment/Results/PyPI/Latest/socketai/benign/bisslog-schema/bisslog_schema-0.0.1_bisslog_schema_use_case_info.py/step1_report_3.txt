{
  "purpose": "Define a data model class UseCaseInfo for modeling use case metadata, including triggers, criticality, and actor details.",
  "sources": "Data input from a dictionary passed to the from_dict method, particularly data fields 'triggers', 'criticality', 'name', 'description', 'type', 'tags', and 'actor'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data processing that could lead to leaks or malicious actions. The code mainly constructs objects from safe data sources.",
  "flows": "Data from the input dictionary flows into object attributes through controlled parsing, especially converting 'criticality' into enum types via explicit checks. No direct execution of untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code performs standard data parsing and object construction with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a data class with a static method to instantiate from a dictionary. It imports classes and enums that are used for data validation and conversion. The criticality attribute is converted carefully based on its type, with no untrusted code execution. No external system calls, network access, or unsafe practices are evident. The overall structure is typical for data modeling and does not contain malicious or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign data model class used for structuring use case information. It handles data input securely and efficiently, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
