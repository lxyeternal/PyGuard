{
  "purpose": "Define a data model class UseCaseInfo to encapsulate use case metadata, including triggers, criticality, and actor information, with a factory method for instantiation from a dictionary.",
  "sources": "The method from_dict reads data from an input dictionary, specifically keys 'triggers', 'criticality', 'name', 'description', 'type', 'tags', and 'actor'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit untrusted data; it only constructs an object. No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input dictionary through parsing in from_dict, where 'triggers' are processed via TriggerInfo.from_dict, and 'criticality' is interpreted and mapped to an enum, ultimately populating the UseCaseInfo instance.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard data class and enum handling. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward data class UseCaseInfo inheriting from EntityInfo, with attributes for triggers, criticality, and actor. The static method from_dict safely parses input data, converting trigger dictionaries via TriggerInfo.from_dict and mapping criticality values to enum members or numeric values. The code uses safe type checks and standard enum operations, with no signs of malicious behavior. There are no external data transmissions, command executions, or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured data model with safe parsing logic. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this code snippet. It is a typical implementation for data encapsulation and deserialization.",
