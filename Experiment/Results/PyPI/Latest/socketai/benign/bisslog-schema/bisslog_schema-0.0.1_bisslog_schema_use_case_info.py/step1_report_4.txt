  "purpose": "Define the UseCaseInfo class for modeling use case metadata including triggers, criticality, and actor details.",
  "sources": "Reading module imports, class attributes, and method parameters such as 'data' and nested dictionary entries.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe data handling if data is untrusted, but no direct sinks for executing code or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data is parsed from input dictionary 'data', particularly through 'from_dict' method, with flow into object instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a data class with a static method for creating an instance from a dictionary input. It imports necessary modules and utilizes standard data validation for 'criticality'. The flow involves parsing nested dictionaries and converting values into enum types. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code injection. The logic appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data class implementation for modeling use case info. There are no indications of malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscated code. The code appears safe and well-structured.",
