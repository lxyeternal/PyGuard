  "purpose": "Defines a data class UseCaseInfo for modeling use case metadata, including triggers, criticality, and actor details, with safe deserialization from dict.",
  "sources": "Input dictionary in from_dict method, specifically data.get('triggers'), data.get('criticality'), and data.get('actor')",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is used in system calls, network, or file operations",
  "flows": "Data from input dict flows into triggers list, criticality enum conversion, and actor attribute assignment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard data parsing, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code defines a safe, straightforward data class extending EntityInfo, with a static method to instantiate from a dict. It safely converts 'triggers' via TriggerInfo.from_dict and maps 'criticality' to enum or numeric types with proper checks. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure practices are present. External modules are used for data modeling, which are assumed safe. The logic is clear, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data container with safe parsing logic. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
