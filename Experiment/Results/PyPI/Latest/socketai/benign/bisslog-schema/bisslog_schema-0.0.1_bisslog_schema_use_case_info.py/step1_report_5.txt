{
  "purpose": "Define a data class UseCaseInfo for modeling use case metadata including triggers, criticality, and actor details.",
  "sources": "Data received from a dictionary parameter in the from_dict static method; imports from external modules.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is being sent over network, written to files, or used in insecure commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input dictionary through processing in from_dict, setting attributes in UseCaseInfo.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of standard data class pattern and safe type conversions.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a data class that models use case info, with a static method to instantiate from a dictionary. It processes triggers by calling from_dict on TriggerInfo objects and interprets criticality from various input types. There are no network operations, eval, exec, or other suspicious behaviors. External dependencies are used for data models and enums, which is standard. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward data modeling class with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It safely processes input data and relies on external schema modules. There are no anomalies or malicious indicators detected.",
