  "purpose": "To read and parse service metadata files in YAML or JSON format into a ServiceInfo object.",
  "sources": "User-provided file path, default file paths, file content read via open() function.",
  "sinks": "Parsing functions (yaml.safe_load, json.load), data passed to ServiceInfo.from_dict()",
  "flows": "File read via open() -> Data parsed by yaml.safe_load or json.load -> Data passed to ServiceInfo.from_dict()",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.import_module('yaml') to import YAML parser dynamically; no other suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code reads metadata files from specified or default paths, using standard file I/O. It conditionally loads either YAML or JSON data, then converts it into a ServiceInfo object. No untrusted input manipulation occurs beyond normal file handling. The dynamic import of 'yaml' is standard and does not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. No evidence of data exfiltration, network activity, or harmful system modifications. The code follows typical safe practices for file handling and parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, primarily handling file reading and parsing into data objects. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. It performs safe, standard operations for reading configuration files, with proper validation and error handling.",
