  "purpose": "Read and parse service metadata files in YAML or JSON format into a ServiceInfo object.",
  "sources": "File system via os.path.isfile, file opening with open(), importlib.import_module('yaml') for YAML files, json.load for JSON files.",
  "sinks": "Loading YAML data via yaml.safe_load, loading JSON data via json.load, calling ServiceInfo.from_dict with parsed data.",
  "flows": "File existence check -> file opening -> format detection -> YAML or JSON parsing -> data passed to ServiceInfo.from_dict.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import of 'yaml' module only when needed; no hardcoded credentials, no network access, no obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code performs safe file checks, conditionally loads YAML or JSON based on file extension, and then processes the data into a ServiceInfo object. It raises clear exceptions if the path is invalid or unsupported formats are used. The import of 'yaml' is deferred and conditional, which is standard and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs are present. The reliance on external modules such as 'yaml' and 'json' for data parsing is typical. Overall, the code seems straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script securely reads and parses metadata files, using standard practices for file validation and data processing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code segment.",
