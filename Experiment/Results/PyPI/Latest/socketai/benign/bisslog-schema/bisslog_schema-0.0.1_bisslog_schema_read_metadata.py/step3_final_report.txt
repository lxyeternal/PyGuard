  "purpose": "Reads and parses service metadata files in YAML or JSON format, converting them into a ServiceInfo object.",
  "sources": "File system paths, specifically the provided path parameter or default path options; file content read via open().",
  "sinks": "Data parsed from files, used to instantiate ServiceInfo objects; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "flows": "File existence check -> File opening -> Format detection -> Parsing with yaml or json -> Conversion to ServiceInfo.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import of 'yaml' module only when needed; no other suspicious or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation of file paths, supports multiple formats, and uses safe parsing methods. The dynamic import of 'yaml' is a common pattern for optional dependencies. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The logic is straightforward, with proper error handling. No malicious or maliciously intended code detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. The dynamic import of 'yaml' is standard for optional dependencies and does not indicate malicious intent. The low risk score is justified. Overall, the dependency poses no security threat.",
