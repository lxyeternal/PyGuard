{
  "purpose": "To read and parse service metadata files in YAML or JSON format and convert them into a ServiceInfo object.",
  "sources": "User-provided file path parameter; default path options; file reading operations; dynamic import of 'yaml' module.",
  "sinks": "File reading operations; dynamic import of 'yaml' module; parsing data with yaml.safe_load() and json.load().",
  "flows": "User input for file path -> file existence check -> opening file -> file format detection -> YAML or JSON parsing -> ServiceInfo.from_dict() conversion.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.import_module to import 'yaml' dynamically; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no external network connections; no obfuscated code; reliance on dynamic import which could be manipulated if 'yaml' module path is tampered.",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration files in YAML or JSON format, with file path validation and default fallback options. It dynamically imports the 'yaml' module only when needed, which is a standard pattern. There are no signs of malicious code such as system commands execution, network activity, or data exfiltration. The parsing functions are standard and depend on external libraries. The dynamic import could be slightly unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for configuration loading.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard file reading and parsing operations with no evident malicious intent. It properly validates paths and formats and converts data into a structured object. No malicious behavior or supply chain attack indicators are detected.",
