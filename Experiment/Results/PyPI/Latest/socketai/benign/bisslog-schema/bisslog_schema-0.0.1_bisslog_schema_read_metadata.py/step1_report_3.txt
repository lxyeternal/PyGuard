  "purpose": "Read and parse service metadata files in YAML or JSON formats to create a ServiceInfo object.",
  "sources": "File reading via open(), input file paths, default path options, os.path.isfile() checks.",
  "sinks": "Parsing data with yaml.safe_load() and json.load(); passing data to ServiceInfo.from_dict().",
  "flows": "Read file -> parse with yaml or json -> convert to ServiceInfo object.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib to import 'yaml' dynamically; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no external network connections or code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely reads local files based on provided or default paths, verifying file existence before reading. The dynamic import of 'yaml' is a common pattern for optional dependencies. Data is parsed safely using yaml.safe_load() or json.load(). The parsed data is passed to ServiceInfo.from_dict(), assuming it performs proper validation. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. No external network or system modifications are involved. The code does not perform any unsafe operations or include obfuscated code features.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, safe file reading and parsing utility for service metadata. No malicious intent or security issues are evident based on the provided code.",
