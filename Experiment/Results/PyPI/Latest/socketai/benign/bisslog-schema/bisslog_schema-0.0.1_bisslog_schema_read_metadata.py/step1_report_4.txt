  "purpose": "Read and parse service metadata files in YAML or JSON formats into a ServiceInfo object.",
  "sources": "File system reads via os.path.isfile, open(), and dynamic import of 'yaml' module.",
  "sinks": "Parsing data with yaml.safe_load() and json.load(), returning ServiceInfo object.",
  "flows": "File path validation -> File opening -> YAML/JSON parsing -> ServiceInfo creation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.import_module('yaml') inside function; dynamic import is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, no network or system commands.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file validation, default path searching, and reading YAML or JSON files. The dynamic import of 'yaml' is common when YAML is optional. No untrusted data sources are present aside from file input, which is validated. No dangerous code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The module's purpose is configuration reading, with no suspicious behavior. The overall structure is straightforward, with proper validation and exception handling. No anomalies suggest malicious intent or supply chain attack. It adheres to expected practices for reading configuration files.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performs standard configuration file reading, and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware are identified.",
