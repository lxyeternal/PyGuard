  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured configuration module for defining trigger options. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified given its purely declarative nature. The malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, aligning with the assessments in the provided reports."
