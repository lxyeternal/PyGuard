{
  "purpose": "Defines various trigger configuration classes and enums for service entry points, including HTTP, WebSocket, consumer, and schedule triggers.",
  "sources": "Input data from dictionaries used in from_dict methods; external configuration or user-provided data fed into these methods.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of classes from untrusted data; no direct sinks such as network, file, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dictionaries into class attributes via from_dict methods, then into TriggerInfo for type identification and options instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The code strictly handles data deserialization and class instantiation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data classes and enums to represent trigger configurations, with methods for deserialization from dictionaries. There are no network operations, system commands, or other malicious behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors are evident. Usage of abstract base classes and type-safe enums suggests well-structured code, not obfuscated or malicious. The code is purely for configuration handling with no external side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured configuration definition module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only deserializes data into configuration objects and does not perform any harmful operations.",
