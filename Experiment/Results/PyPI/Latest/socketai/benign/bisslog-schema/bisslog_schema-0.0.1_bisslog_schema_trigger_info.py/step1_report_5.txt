  "purpose": "Define trigger configuration classes and enums for various service entry points, such as HTTP, WebSocket, consumer queues, and scheduled triggers.",
  "sources": "Input data is read in the from_dict methods of each TriggerOptions subclass, and from the static method in TriggerInfo which processes a dictionary containing trigger type and options.",
  "sinks": "Data flows mainly within class methods for deserialization; no external sinks (e.g., network, file system, system commands) are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (from dicts) flows into specific trigger option classes via from_dict methods, then into TriggerInfo via from_dict, which constructs the full trigger object.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. The code appears straightforward, well-structured, and limited to configuration data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class for trigger options and multiple concrete subclasses for different trigger types, each with a from_dict deserialization method. Enums link trigger types to classes, and TriggerInfo consolidates type and options. No external data sources or sinks, or dynamic code execution, are present. The code appears purely declarative and configuration-focused without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration data model for trigger definitions; it does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is well-structured and focused on data deserialization for trigger setup.",
