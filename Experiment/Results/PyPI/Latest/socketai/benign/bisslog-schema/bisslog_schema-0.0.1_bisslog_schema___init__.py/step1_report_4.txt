  "purpose": "This code provides a module that exports a function read_service_metadata for handling metadata in a distributed system framework called bisslog schema.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing read_service_metadata from a local module read_metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this snippet since it only imports and exports a function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of a docstring description, an import statement, and an __all__ declaration. It does not include any dynamic execution, input handling, or suspicious logic. The import is from a local module, which appears standard and not inherently malicious. There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The code appears straightforward and adheres to typical Python module structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves as a simple module export setup for a metadata reading function within a lightweight distributed system framework.",
