  "purpose": "A minimal Python module that imports a function from a local module and exposes it via __all__, serving as an interface or wrapper for system metadata reading.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.read_metadata)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "Import from local module; no data flow within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module with a descriptive docstring, importing a function from a local module and exposing it via __all__. It contains no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The import is from a relative module, which is standard. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of security issues or malicious intent. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
