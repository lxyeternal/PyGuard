  "purpose": "To provide a lightweight framework for organizing and documenting distributed system metadata.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .read_metadata import read_service_metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data output.",
  "flows": "The imported function read_service_metadata could potentially be used elsewhere, but within this code, no data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a docstring explaining the purpose of the module, an import statement, and an __all__ declaration for export. There are no input handling, data processing, or network activities present. The import is relative, indicating a local module, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or hidden functionality. The code appears to be a straightforward module definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module defining a framework for metadata organization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
