  "purpose": "The code provides a module that imports a specific function and exposes it publicly, serving as part of a documentation or schema framework for distributed systems.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.read_metadata import read_service_metadata).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points that handle untrusted data are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data paths are evident in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and contains no unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. It merely imports and exports a function.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports a function from a local module and defines __all__ for export. It does not process data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No signs of malicious intent or security issues are present. Its simplicity reduces risk and indicates purpose as a documentation or schema utility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing a simple import and export operation with no malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
