  "purpose": "Define a ServiceInfo dataclass for service metadata, extending EntityInfo with additional attributes.",
  "sources": "Input dictionary 'data' in from_dict method, nested use case data, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Creation of UseCaseInfo objects via from_dict, no apparent sinks for untrusted data leading to security impacts.",
  "flows": "Data from input dictionary -> parsing and merging tags -> creation of UseCaseInfo instances -> return of ServiceInfo object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Use of type annotations and data class features appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data structure definition with a method for constructing instances from dictionaries. It uses standard Python features such as dataclasses, type hints, and dictionary operations. The from_dict method merges tags and constructs nested UseCaseInfo objects, but there are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The use of imports and data handling appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, standard implementation for managing service metadata. No malicious code, backdoors, or security threats are detected. The code primarily focuses on data parsing and structure without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
