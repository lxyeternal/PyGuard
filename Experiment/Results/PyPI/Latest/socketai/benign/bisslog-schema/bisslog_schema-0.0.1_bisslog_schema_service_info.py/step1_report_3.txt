  "purpose": "Define a ServiceInfo dataclass for service-level metadata with a method to instantiate from a dictionary.",
  "sources": "Input data to from_dict() method (a dictionary with service and use case info).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data directly; the code mostly processes and constructs objects.",
  "flows": "from_dict() reads data -> processes tags and use cases -> creates ServiceInfo object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data class extension that constructs an object from a dictionary input. It merges tags from the service level into each use case's tags, which is normal. No external network calls, no eval or exec, and no suspicious string manipulations are present. The code relies on external classes (EntityInfo, UseCaseInfo) but does not invoke any suspicious or insecure behavior itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data modeling utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard data processing and object creation without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
