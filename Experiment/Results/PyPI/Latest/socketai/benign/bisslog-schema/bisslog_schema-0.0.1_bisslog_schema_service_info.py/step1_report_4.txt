  "purpose": "Define a ServiceInfo dataclass for representing service metadata, including methods to instantiate from dictionaries.",
  "sources": "The data parameter in from_dict method, which provides service info, including nested use case data.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks where untrusted data is directly used in a security-sensitive context. The code primarily processes data structures without executing or transmitting data externally.",
  "flows": "Data is read from a dictionary (data), merged with tags, and then used to instantiate a ServiceInfo object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Use of 'update' on tags is standard data merging.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass extending EntityInfo, with additional optional attributes. The from_dict static method constructs an instance by merging tags from the top-level and use case levels, then creating UseCaseInfo instances. There are no code injection points, no network activity, and no data leaks. The code functions as data processing and object creation logic, with no malicious behavior or security risks observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard data modeling implementation for service metadata with safe data processing patterns. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
