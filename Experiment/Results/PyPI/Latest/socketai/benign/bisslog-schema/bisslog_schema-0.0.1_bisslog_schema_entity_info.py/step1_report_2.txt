  "purpose": "Provide a base data model for entity information using dataclasses.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs are present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks as no input/output operations are performed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard Python features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data class 'EntityInfo' with optional attributes for name, description, type, and tags. It uses standard Python dataclass syntax and type annotations without any external data fetching, network operations, or potentially malicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign and standard implementation of a data model class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
