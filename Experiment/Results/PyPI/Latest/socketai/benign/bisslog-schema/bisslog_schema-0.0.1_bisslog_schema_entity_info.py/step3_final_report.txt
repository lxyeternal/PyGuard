{
  "purpose": "To evaluate the security and malicious potential of the provided Python code, which defines a simple data class EntityInfo with optional attributes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class attribute definitions and default factory for 'tags'. No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code is purely structural.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to class attribute initialization; no external data flows or untrusted input processing are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python dataclass with optional attributes and a mutable default for 'tags'. It uses standard Python features without external dependencies, network activity, or dynamic execution. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed. The code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data model with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
