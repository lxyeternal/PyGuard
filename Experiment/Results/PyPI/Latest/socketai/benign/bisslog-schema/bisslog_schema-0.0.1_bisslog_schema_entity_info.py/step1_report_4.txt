  "purpose": "Defines a data model class for storing basic entity information using Python dataclasses.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'dataclass', 'field', 'Optional', 'Dict'; class definition and attribute declarations.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data, perform I/O, or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "None; no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward, using standard Python features for data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Python modules for data class creation and type hinting. It defines a simple 'EntityInfo' class with optional string attributes and a dictionary attribute with a default factory. There are no user inputs, network operations, or external interactions. The implementation is typical for data modeling and does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data class definition intended for storing entity information. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
