  "purpose": "Define a data model class for representing basic entity information.",
  "sources": "Import statements for dataclasses and typing modules, class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only defines a data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Python modules to define a dataclass 'EntityInfo' with optional attributes. The class uses type annotations and default values, including a mutable default for 'tags'. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python practices without any dynamic code execution, network operations, or external data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple data model for entity information. It contains no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. The implementation appears safe and intended solely for data organization.",
