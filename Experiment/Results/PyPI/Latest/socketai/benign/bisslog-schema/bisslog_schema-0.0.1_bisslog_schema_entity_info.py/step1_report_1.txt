  "purpose": "Define a basic data model class for representing entity information.",
  "sources": "Imports from dataclasses and typing modules; class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that handle untrusted input or output; code is purely structural.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code only sets up data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines a simple data class with optional attributes. It uses standard Python features with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious logic. There are no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, and no malicious or unusual behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign definition of a data model class without any malicious intent or security risks.",
