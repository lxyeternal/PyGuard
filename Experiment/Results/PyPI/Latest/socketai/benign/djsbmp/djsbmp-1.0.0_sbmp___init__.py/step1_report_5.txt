  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the sbmp module, likely to use its functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package's sbmp module",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; potential indirect sinks depend on the imported module's usage",
  "flows": "Data flows depend on subsequent code that uses the imported symbols; no flows evident in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import (from .sbmp import *) can sometimes hide malicious intent, but is not inherently malicious; code is minimal and does not show signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a single import statement that imports all symbols from a module named sbmp in the current package. This is a standard Python practice for module imports. There are no other code lines, no function definitions, no data processing, and no suspicious operations visible. The import statement alone does not indicate malicious intent; however, the purpose and content of the sbmp module are unknown, which could be a concern if the module contains malicious code. Since the snippet is minimal and lacks context, it is impossible to definitively identify malicious activity or malware from this alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of an import statement, which by itself is not malicious. Without additional context or code, there is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The import could be benign or malicious depending on the contents of the sbmp module, but based solely on this snippet, it appears safe.",
