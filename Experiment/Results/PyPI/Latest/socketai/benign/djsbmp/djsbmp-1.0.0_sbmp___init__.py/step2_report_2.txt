  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the reported issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .sbmp import *`\n- The code is a minimal relative import statement, common in Python packages.\n- No additional code, data handling, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The main concern is whether the imported module 'sbmp' could be malicious or obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations\n\n**Presence of issues:**\n- The code itself is straightforward; the import statement is syntactically correct and typical.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior from this snippet alone.\n- The risk or malware scores should reflect the potential threat posed by the imported module, not just the import statement.\n\n**Errors or flaws in reports:**\n- All reports correctly identify the minimal nature of the code.\n- Some reports suggest that relative imports could be suspicious, but in Python, relative imports are standard in package structures.\n- No report mentions checking the contents of the 'sbmp' module, which is crucial to assess actual risk.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Analysis\n\n**Malware Score:**\n- All reports currently assign malware = 0, which is appropriate given the snippet.\n- Since the code only imports a module, unless the module itself is malicious, the malware score should remain 0.\n- If the module 'sbmp' is malicious, the risk depends on its content, which is unknown here.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**\n- All reports assign obfuscated = 0, which is reasonable. The import statement is clear and not obfuscated.\n\n**Risk Score:**\n- The overall security risk is low based on the snippet alone.\n- Some reports assign a risk score of 0.1 or 0.2, which is acceptable for minimal import statements, especially considering potential malicious modules.\n- The scores of 0.4 or 0.6 seem high unless there is prior knowledge of malicious content.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- The import statement alone does not indicate malicious activity.\n- The real concern is whether the 'sbmp' module contains malicious code, but that cannot be determined from this snippet.\n- The reports do not suggest any assumptions that are unfounded; they mostly acknowledge the lack of additional context.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores should reflect the absence of malicious activity in the import statement itself.\n- The malware score should remain at 0 unless there's evidence of malicious content within 'sbmp'.\n- The risk score should be low, unless additional context indicates otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to account for potential malicious module, but very low given current info)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is benign in isolation. Without inspecting the 'sbmp' module, there's no reason to suspect malicious behavior. The scores should be adjusted to reflect this.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis conservative approach aligns with the evidence and standard security assessment practices.",
