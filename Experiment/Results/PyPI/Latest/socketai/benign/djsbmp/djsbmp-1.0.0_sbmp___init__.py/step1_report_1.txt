{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the 'sbmp' module within the same package, likely for functionality reuse or modular design.",
  "sources": "The import statement imports code from the local module 'sbmp'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible from the single import statement; no source-to-sink flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a minimal import statement with no additional logic, which by itself is not unusual but provides limited context.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement, which is common in Python package structures. No data processing, user input, or network operations are present. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior within this single line.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a straightforward import from a local module, which is typical in modular Python projects.",
