  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports analyze a single import statement: `from .sbmp import *`.\n- No code beyond the import is provided.\n- The import is from a local module, which is common in Python packages.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are evident from this minimal snippet.\n- The content of the `sbmp` module is unknown; thus, potential malicious behavior depends on its internal code, not just the import statement.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on code presence:\n- The code snippet is a straightforward import statement. All reports correctly identify this.\n- No issues are present in the code itself; the import statement is syntactically valid and typical.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:\n- No significant errors are apparent. All reports correctly state that the import alone does not reveal malicious activity.\n- Some reports mention the potential concern of relative imports (`from .sbmp import *`), which can sometimes be suspicious if used improperly, but this is not inherently malicious.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Confidence scores** are generally reasonable, reflecting the limited context.\n- **Malware scores** are all zero, which is appropriate given the minimal code.\n- **Security risk scores** are low, aligning with the lack of evidence for risks.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- Since the `sbmp` module's content is unknown, the true risk depends on its internal code. The import statement itself is benign.\n- The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious intent solely based on the import.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- No changes needed to the scores; they are consistent with the analysis.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low, given the minimal context.\n- The malware scores should remain zero unless further code indicates malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the provided reports and code snippet, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just a simple import; potential concern if `sbmp` is malicious, but no evidence here)\n\n**Summary:**\n- The import statement is standard, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The content of the imported module is unknown, but that does not affect the assessment of this import statement.\n- Overall, the code appears benign, and the scores reflect that.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the minimal context. No further action or suspicion is warranted based solely on this import statement.",
