{
  "purpose": "The code imports everything from the module '.sbmp', likely as part of a larger package or project.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module '.sbmp'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially any function or class within the imported module, depending on how it is used later.",
  "flows": "Data flow depends on subsequent code; import itself does not execute runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a minimal import statement with no additional logic. The use of a relative import may be suspicious if the context is unclear, but by itself, it does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a single import statement from a relative module '.sbmp'. There is no evidence of input handling, data transmission, or other suspicious activity. Without additional code or context, this import appears standard. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The import could be part of legitimate functionality, or potentially malicious if the '.sbmp' module contains malicious code; however, the import statement alone does not reveal this.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no inherent malicious behavior. It does not provide enough information to determine if the imported module is malicious. Overall, the code by itself appears benign.",
