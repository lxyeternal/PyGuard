  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of a minimal import statement in a Python package.",
  "sources": "The import statement `from .sbmp import *` itself; no other data sources or inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the `sbmp` module if it contains malicious code, but the import statement alone does not execute or reveal this.",
  "flows": "Importing all symbols from the `sbmp` module; no data flows or execution beyond the import are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in the code snippet; the import statement is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import, common in Python packages. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious activity can be inferred from this line alone. The risk and malware scores are appropriately low, reflecting the minimal context. The primary concern is the content of the `sbmp` module, which cannot be assessed here. The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1) to account for potential malicious content within the module. Confidence levels are moderate to high, given the simplicity of the code. Overall, the import is benign, and no further action is necessary based solely on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and standard; there is no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. The risk is minimal, contingent on the unknown content of the `sbmp` module. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
