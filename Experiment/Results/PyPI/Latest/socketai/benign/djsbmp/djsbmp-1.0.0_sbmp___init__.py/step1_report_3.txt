  "purpose": "Import all contents from the sbmp module within the same package",
  "sources": "Import statement indicating use of local module 'sbmp'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow; only an import statement",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import; no suspicious or unusual code behavior; minimal code content",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement, importing everything from the 'sbmp' module in the same package. There are no additional code segments, functions, or logic present. Relative imports are standard in Python packages. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious patterns are evident. The lack of further code limits the analysis, but based on this snippet alone, no malicious activity can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal import statement with no indication of malicious behavior. The code appears to be part of a larger package structure and does not show signs of security risks or malware based solely on this snippet.",
