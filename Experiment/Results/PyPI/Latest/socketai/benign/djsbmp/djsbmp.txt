      "conclusion": "The overall security assessment indicates low inherent risk in the control scripts themselves, with the primary concern being the malicious snippets stored as strings that could be exploited if misused. The assigned scores—malware around 0.6 for reports containing malicious snippets, obfuscation at 0, and risk around 0.2–0.6—are justified and consistent with the content. No adjustments are necessary."
