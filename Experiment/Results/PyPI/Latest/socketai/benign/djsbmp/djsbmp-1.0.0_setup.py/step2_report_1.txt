  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code is a standard setup.py script with no malicious behavior.\n- No anomalies, no suspicious code, malware, or obfuscation.\n- Confidence: 1 (high certainty)\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also describes a typical setup.py, noting open() without validation but not malicious.\n- Slight concern about open() without exception handling, but this is common in setup scripts.\n- No malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (minimal)\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to previous reports, standard setup.py with no suspicious code.\n- No anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Confirms a benign, standard setup script.\n- Notes no dynamic code or network activity.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also confirms standard setup.py behavior.\n- No suspicious code or external operations.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Justification:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports agree that the code is a typical setup.py script, with no malicious or suspicious code.\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0 across all reports, as there's no indication of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is detected.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any malicious activity, the overall security risk remains at 0.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a benign, standard package setup script.\n- No signs of supply chain risk, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The minor concern about open() without exception handling is common and not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and consensus across all reports.",
