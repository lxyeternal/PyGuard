  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for a Python package.\n- No suspicious behaviors, external network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are detected.\n- The only minor concern is the use of open() without context managers, which could lead to file access issues but is not malicious.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are very low or zero, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Confirmations & Validations:**\n- The code matches the original code provided.\n- No issues are present in the code logic or structure.\n- The scores given are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential Improvements:**\n- For robustness, replacing open() calls with context managers (`with open() as f:`) would be better practice, but this is a standard pattern in many setup scripts and not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (appropriate, no security risks identified)\n\n**My Personal Estimate:**\n- Given the thorough review and consensus, I concur with the provided scores.\n- I would maintain the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at **0**.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0",
