  "purpose": "The code interacts with Jira API to retrieve and process issue and subtask attributes for validation purposes.",
  "sources": "User input for Jira issue link; Jira API calls to retrieve issue data and subtasks.",
  "sinks": "Data extraction from Jira API responses; printing to console; usage of Jira issue fields.",
  "flows": "Input link -> extract issue code -> fetch issue data from Jira -> process issue/subtask attributes -> output validation results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data present; no suspicious network connections; no code obfuscation; no suspicious dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs data retrieval from Jira via the jira-python library, processes fields, and outputs validation logs. It uses input prompts, interacts with Jira objects, and formats data for validation. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system modifications. All operations appear focused on data validation and reporting, with no external network activity beyond the Jira API calls, which are standard for Jira integrations. The code does not perform any file operations, system commands, or dynamic code execution. Therefore, no malicious or security-compromising behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Jira data processing script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions to validate issue data based on predefined criteria. There are no signs of supply chain attacks or malicious modifications within this code snippet.",
