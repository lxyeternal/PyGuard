  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging a Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' and passing data to setup() functions; no untrusted data flow leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' without a context manager; minor resource leak risk but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script for packaging Python modules. It imports 'setuptools', reads 'README.md' directly without a context manager, and defines package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and CLI entry points. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The reports confirm the script's benign nature, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The only minor issue is the file read without a 'with' statement, which is a common pattern but not security-related. No code injection, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected. The overall structure and content are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is a benign, standard package configuration with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate; no adjustments are necessary.",
