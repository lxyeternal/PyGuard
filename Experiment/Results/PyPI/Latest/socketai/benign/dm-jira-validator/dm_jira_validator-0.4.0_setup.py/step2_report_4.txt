  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Content**: Thorough review of the setup.py script, confirming it is a standard package configuration with no malicious code, obfuscation, or security issues.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n     - Malware: 0 (correct)\n     - Security Risk: 0 (correct)\n   - **Assessment**: The report is accurate and comprehensive. No changes needed.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Content**: Empty response.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (no info, so acceptable)\n     - Malware: 0 (no info, acceptable)\n     - Security Risk: 0 (acceptable)\n   - **Assessment**: No issues, but since no information is provided, the scores are fine.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Content**: Empty response.\n   - **Scores**: Same as above, acceptable.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Content**: Similar to Report 1, confirms the script is benign, with a note about using 'open' without a context manager, which is a minor resource leak but not malicious.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n     - Malware: 0 (correct)\n     - Security Risk: 0 (correct)\n   - **Assessment**: The note about resource management is valid but does not affect security. The scores are appropriate.\n\n**Overall Analysis**:\n- All reports agree that the setup.py script is benign, standard, and free from malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The only concern noted is the use of 'open' without a 'with' statement, which is a minor code quality issue but not security-related.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- The security risk score should be 0, given the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n**Additional Notes**:\n- Since the reports are consistent and accurate, no adjustments are necessary.\n- The overall assessment aligns with the initial conclusion: this setup script is safe and standard.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the package setup is secure and free from malicious intent.",
