  "purpose": "Imports the 'validate_ticket' function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module 'main' to access 'validate_ticket'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are evident from this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, containing only an import statement; no suspicious or unusual behavior is observable.",
  "analysis": "This code only imports a function from a local module, which is a common and benign operation. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration. The lack of additional context limits further analysis, but based solely on this statement, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior detected. It appears to be a routine part of a larger application without any security concerns from this fragment alone.",
