  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Issue presence:** The code is just an import statement, which by itself is benign.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are present.\n   - **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate. Security risk is 0.1, perhaps slightly overestimating the risk of an import statement, but acceptable if considering potential misuse in the broader context.\n   - **Justification for scores:** The low malware score is justified; no malicious activity is indicated. The confidence is high (0.8), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   \n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as above; just an import statement.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n   - **Scores:** Malware score is 0, which is correct. Security risk is 0, appropriate.\n   - **Justification:** No suspicious activity or malicious intent is suggested. The high confidence (1) is justified due to the simplicity and benign nature.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Issue presence:** Again, just an import statement.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n   - **Scores:** Malware is 0, security risk is 0, which is correct.\n   - **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity. The confidence level is high (0.9), consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as above.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n   - **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0, appropriate.\n   - **Justification:** No malicious activity or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as above.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n   - **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1; slightly higher but still acceptable given the minimal code.\n   - **Justification:** The risk score might be marginally overestimated; an import statement alone is unlikely to pose a security risk, but if the imported function is malicious or vulnerable, that would be a concern. However, based solely on this snippet, the low score is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of observations:\n- All reports are consistent: the code is just an import statement.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is correct.\n- The security risk scores are very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable given the minimal code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- The confidence levels are high, which is justified.\n- The malware scores should remain at 0 unless additional context indicates malicious intent.\n- The obfuscated scores are correctly 0, as the code is straightforward.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0–0.1, reflecting minimal risk.\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent with the code snippet provided.**",
