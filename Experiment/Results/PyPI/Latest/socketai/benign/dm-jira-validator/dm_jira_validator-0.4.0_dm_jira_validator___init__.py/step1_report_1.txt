{
  "purpose": "Imports the 'validate_ticket' function from the local 'main' module, likely for ticket validation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the import statement, which pulls in a function from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions like network access or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data processing occur in this snippet; the import may be used elsewhere in the code base.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement, which is typical and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The snippet only contains an import statement, which by itself does not indicate malicious behavior. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of data leaks, backdoors, or malicious actions. The imported function's behavior is unknown, but the import line alone is not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be part of normal application structure, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious code.",
