  "purpose": "Import the function 'validate_ticket' from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a local module file 'main'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only an import statement without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not include any suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, which is a standard Python operation. It imports a specific function from a local module, likely for use elsewhere in the program. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns. Since the code only contains an import statement with no other logic, it cannot be used to perform malicious actions or data leaks by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
