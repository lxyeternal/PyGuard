  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a single import statement: `from .main import validate_ticket`.\n- No code execution, data flow, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code snippets are minimal, standard Python import statements.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.8-1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in reasoning:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly state that this code alone is benign.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 in some reports, which might be slightly high for such a benign snippet. Given the minimal code, a score of 0 is more appropriate unless additional context suggests otherwise.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nSet malware and obfuscated scores to **0** for all reports.  \nFor security risk, unless there's external context, **0** is most appropriate, but a slight increase (e.g., 0.1) could be justified if the import is from an untrusted source or if the larger codebase is unverified.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- The current code snippet is benign; a high risk score is unwarranted.\n- Unless the larger code context indicates malicious intent, the risk score should remain low.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency check:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code snippet.\n- No contradictions or anomalies.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (or at most 0.1 if considering potential misinterpretation)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports correctly identify that this is a benign import statement with no malicious intent. The scores should reflect this benign nature, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0 and risk scores at 0 or very close to it.\n\n**Overall recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis conservative approach aligns with the evidence.",
