{
  "purpose": "This code imports the validate_ticket function from a local module, likely for use in validation logic within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module '.main', which is a source of code inclusion but not external data or input.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this snippet; no data is processed or outputted, and no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing the validate_ticket function from the local module, with no further data or control flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python import statement. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or code execution beyond importing a function. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0-0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of this snippet. Confidence in benign assessment is high, and no anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (0 or 0.1). The reports are accurate and consistent with the code snippet.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
