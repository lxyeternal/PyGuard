  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports identify the code as only consisting of license headers and comments.\n- No executable code, data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.\n- The only notable anomaly is the future copyright year '2025', which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n**Issue Presence Confirmation:**\n- The code snippets are only comments with license and copyright notices.\n- There are no executable instructions, data flows, or code logic.\n- Therefore, all reports correctly conclude that there are no security issues or malicious content.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the nature of the code.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n- The only minor point is the future year '2025', which is an anomaly but not a security concern.\n\n**Score Review and Justification:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The malware score of 0 is correct; no malicious activity is present.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Challenging Assumptions:**\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all reports focus on licensing comments.\n- The potential anomaly of the future copyright year does not imply malicious intent.\n\n**Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code contains only licensing comments with no executable or data processing components. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
