  "anomalies": "Future copyright year '2025' is unusual but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is purely comments with licensing information; no executable code, data flows, or suspicious behavior are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature. The confidence score is 1, as the assessment is straightforward. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only licensing comments with no malicious or security-related content. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
