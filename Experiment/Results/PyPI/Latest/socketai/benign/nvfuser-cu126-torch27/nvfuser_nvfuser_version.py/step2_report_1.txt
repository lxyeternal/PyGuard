  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard lazy import wrapper for `packaging.version` and a custom version class `NvfuserVersion`. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is typical for version handling with lazy import, no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the lazy import pattern and safe version comparison logic. No external or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Reiterates the lazy import pattern, version comparison, and fallback to `pkg_resources`. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0\n- **Assessment:** Well-founded.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion—standard version handling with lazy import, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a standard pattern with no suspicious activity. The dynamic import and fallback are common practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0\n- **Assessment:** Justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code matches the description of a typical version handling utility with lazy import, no malicious code, no obfuscation, and no external system interactions.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Scores are all zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities, external dependencies, or suspicious behavior, a risk score of 0.0 is appropriate.\n- **Consistency:** All reports are consistent in their reasoning and scoring.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation or code hiding)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis code is a benign, well-structured utility for version comparison, employing common patterns for lazy importing and fallback handling.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and thorough. No adjustments needed.",
