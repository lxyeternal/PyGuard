  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms standard lazy import pattern, no malicious behavior.\n- No anomalies, no obfuscation, malware score 0.\n- The logic is straightforward, and the analysis is accurate.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard practices.\n- No suspicious patterns or external system interactions.\n- Malware score 0, consistent with benign utility.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates standard lazy import and version comparison pattern.\n- No external data or malicious intent.\n- Malware score 0.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Focuses on version handling and lazy import with fallback.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Malware score 0.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar conclusions: standard lazy import, safe version handling.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score 0.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is straightforward, well-structured, and employs common patterns for lazy importing and version comparison.\n- **Malware potential:** There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or external system calls.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and uses standard patterns; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** The only potential concern could be the fallback import from `pkg_resources`, but this is a common pattern for optional dependencies and not malicious.\n\n### Final Scores:\n\n| Aspect            | Score  | Justification                                                                                     |\n|-------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0       | No malicious code, no external network activity, no suspicious behavior detected.             |\n| Obfuscated        | 0       | Code is clear, uses standard patterns, no obfuscation.                                          |\n| Security Risk     | 0       | No evident security risks; fallback import is a common pattern.                                |\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n- The code is a utility module for version handling, employing lazy import to optimize load time.\n- No assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities are warranted; the code appears benign.\n- The use of dynamic import and fallback is standard practice, not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nBased on the reports and code review, **the malware score should be 0**, **obfuscated remains 0**, and **risk score should be 0**. There are no signs of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, benign, and well-structured. No further security concerns are identified.",
