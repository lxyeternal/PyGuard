  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple module that imports the 'nn' submodule and exposes it via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from . import nn' which loads a local submodule",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling occurs in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; the code is minimal and standard",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module initialization script. It imports a local submodule 'nn' and explicitly exposes it via __all__. There are no suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The presence of SPDX license identifiers indicates adherence to licensing standards but does not imply malicious intent. The structure is simple, and nothing in the code suggests malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module initialization code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply re-exports a submodule for external use.",
