  "purpose": "This code module imports a submodule named 'nn' and defines an export list for it.",
  "sources": "The code does not read external input or data; it only imports a local module and defines an export list.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or places where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. The SPDX license identifiers are standard and non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a local module named 'nn' and exporting it via __all__. It adheres to standard Python practices for module definition. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The presence of SPDX license comments is typical for open-source projects and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module setup with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages module exports for a local submodule.",
