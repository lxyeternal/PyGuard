  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that re-exports the 'nn' submodule, likely for organizational or namespace convenience.",
  "sources": "The code reads static comments for copyright and license information; imports the 'nn' submodule from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or user input is processed; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The only flow is static import of 'nn' and exporting it via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of license comments, a single import statement, and an __all__ declaration. There are no dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or data processing. The import statement is from a relative module, which is typical for package structuring. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module re-export with no malicious intent or security concerns. It serves a straightforward organizational purpose within a package.",
