{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module re-export, importing a local submodule 'nn' and exposing it via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports a local module 'nn'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as no data processing or I/O occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply imports and exports a module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports a local submodule 'nn' and defines __all__ to export it. It contains standard licensing comments and no dynamic code, I/O, or external data handling. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and clarity. No evidence suggests malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module re-export with no malicious or security concerns. All assessments and scores are appropriate and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
