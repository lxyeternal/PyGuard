  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that re-exports the 'nn' submodule for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads license comments and imports the 'nn' submodule.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data or external output is generated.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input or output; just import and export of a module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; license comments are standard and import statement is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code includes licensing comments and a single import statement for a relative module 'nn'. It then defines '__all__' for module exports. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. It functions as a simple module wrapper. The license comments are standard and do not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module with no malicious behavior. It merely re-exports the 'nn' submodule for public use. No security risks or malware detected.",
