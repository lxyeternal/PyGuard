  "purpose": "Define a version string with build metadata, including a Git commit hash.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of the string '_version_str' with version and build info.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is a simple static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward string assignment with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string with build metadata to a variable. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The inclusion of a commit hash is standard practice and does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the context. No dynamic behavior, input/output, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version string assignment with no security concerns or malicious intent. The existing reports are accurate and consistent. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is justified but does not indicate actual risk.",
