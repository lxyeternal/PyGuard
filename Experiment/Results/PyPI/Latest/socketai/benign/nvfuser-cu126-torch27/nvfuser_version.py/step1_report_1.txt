  "purpose": "Define a version string with a specific version identifier including a build metadata suffix.",
  "sources": "Assignment of a string literal to a variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external output present.",
  "flows": "None; simple assignment without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a version string containing a build metadata suffix ('+gitbfc7ba8'), which is common in versioning but not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string value representing a version with build metadata to a variable. No input handling, no external data, no cryptic code, no suspicious behavior. The version string format follows standard conventions. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious code structures. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply defines a version string with build metadata and shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
