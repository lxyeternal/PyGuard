  "purpose": "Store the version string of a software package, indicating its version and build metadata.",
  "sources": "Assignment of a string literal to a variable (_version_str).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or data sink present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a version string with a commit hash suffix (+gitbfc7ba8) but no related code context or logic; no dynamic code or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string, including a git commit hash suffix, to a variable. This is typical in versioning and does not involve any input, output, or external data. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident in this simple assignment. The string appears standard for versioning with source control metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version string assignment with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
