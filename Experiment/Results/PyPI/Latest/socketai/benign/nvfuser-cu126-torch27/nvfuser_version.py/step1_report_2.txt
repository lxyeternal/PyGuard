  "purpose": "Defines a version string for a Python package or module, indicating its version and build metadata.",
  "sources": "The version string assigned to the variable _version_str.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the string is assigned to a variable without further processing or use of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing; the string is a static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple variable assignment with a version identifier.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string '_version_str' with semantic versioning and build metadata. It appears to be a typical version declaration without any obfuscated code, external input, or malicious logic. There are no suspicious behaviors, data leaks, or malicious patterns detected. The version string indicates a release build with a Git commit hash, which is common in development or version tracking.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard version declaration for a Python package or module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
