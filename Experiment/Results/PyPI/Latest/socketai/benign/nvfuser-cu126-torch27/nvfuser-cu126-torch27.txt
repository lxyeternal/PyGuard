It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low (0 or 0.1). Overall, it is safe for use in performance benchmarking contexts."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for GPU info and data type conversions in PyTorch. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present. The low risk score (0.1) is justified by the use of ctypes for system library loading, which is common in GPU-related utilities but could be a vector if environment is compromised. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is safe for use."
