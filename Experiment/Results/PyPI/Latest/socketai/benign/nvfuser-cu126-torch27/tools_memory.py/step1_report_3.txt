  "purpose": "Retrieve the available system memory in GB across different platforms.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'psutil' library and reads from '/proc/meminfo' file.",
  "sinks": "Returns numerical data about available memory; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Imports 'psutil' to get memory info -> if fails, reads '/proc/meminfo' -> parses and returns available memory in GB.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling (except:) without logging or specific handling; standard method for getting system memory, no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to obtain available system memory via 'psutil' library, which is common for system monitoring. If that fails, it reads '/proc/meminfo' directly, parsing the 'MemAvailable' value. Both approaches are standard for Linux systems. The exception handling is broad and silent, which is a minor concern but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. The code performs legitimate system resource checking without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, legitimate utility to retrieve available system memory. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The broad exception handling could be improved for robustness but does not pose security concerns.",
