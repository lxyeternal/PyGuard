  "purpose": "Retrieve the available system memory in gigabytes.",
  "sources": "Reading system memory info from psutil library or /proc/meminfo file.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks of untrusted data or data leaks; primarily system information gathering.",
  "flows": "System memory info is obtained from either psutil (trusted library) or reading /proc/meminfo (local file), then processed internally.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling without logging or error reporting; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to get available memory via the psutil library, falling back to reading /proc/meminfo if psutil is unavailable. Both methods are standard for system resource monitoring. Exception handling is overly broad, but no malicious behavior or obfuscated code is present. The functions serve legitimate purposes for resource checking.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate system memory checks without any signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. No malicious intent or suspicious activity detected.",
