  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the actual code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The function `get_available_memory_gb()` attempts to retrieve available system memory in GB.\n- It first tries to use the `psutil` library; if that fails, it reads `/proc/meminfo` for the `MemAvailable` value.\n- Exception handling is broad (`except:`) and silent.\n- The code performs a legitimate system resource monitoring task.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- No untrusted data inputs or data leaks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly describes the function.\n- **Sources:** Correctly notes `psutil` and `/proc/meminfo`.\n- **Sinks:** No data leaks or security issues.\n- **Flows:** Data flows are straightforward.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no malicious code, exception handling is broad but benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, with slightly different wording.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (full confidence)\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.1 (slightly higher, but still minimal)\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly overestimating risk; reading system info is low risk. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Similar findings, emphasizing standard methods.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.2 (still low)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. The broad exception handling is noted but not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Similar to above, with emphasis on the straightforward nature.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Also similar, mentions potential data leakage if info is transmitted elsewhere, but the code itself does not do any transmission.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly speculative about data leakage, but since no transmission occurs in the code, this is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall observations:\n- **Presence of malicious activity:** None detected; all reports agree on benign nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard utility function for system resource monitoring.\n- The broad exception handling is a minor concern but not malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to broad exception handling, which could be improved but not a security issue)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The low scores reflect this well.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed. The code is a legitimate, safe utility function for system memory retrieval.",
