{
  "purpose": "The function retrieves available system memory in GB, primarily for resource monitoring or management.",
  "sources": "Reading from the 'psutil' library for system memory info; reading from '/proc/meminfo' file for Linux systems.",
  "sinks": "Data returned by the function; no untrusted data sinks are evident as the function only reads system info and returns a numeric value.",
  "flows": "Input sources (psutil or /proc/meminfo) flow into processing steps, resulting in a numeric output representing available memory in GB.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad except clauses suppresses errors silently; no explicit hardcoded secrets or malicious code present. The code is straightforward system info retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import the 'psutil' library for retrieving system memory info. If unavailable, it reads from '/proc/meminfo' to extract 'MemAvailable'. Error handling is broad and silent, which can hide issues but does not introduce malicious behavior. The function is a standard approach to monitor system memory, with no suspicious or malicious code present. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility function for system resource monitoring without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It uses standard system calls and library functions without any harmful side effects.",
