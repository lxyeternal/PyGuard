  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Purpose: Retrieve available system memory in GB.\n- Methods: Use `psutil` library if available; fallback to reading `/proc/meminfo`.\n- Behavior: Standard system resource monitoring, no external data input, no data leaks, no malicious code.\n- Exception handling: Broad `except:` blocks, which silently suppress errors but are not malicious.\n- No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; standard system info retrieval.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Overall reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — justified given the benign nature.\n- **Assessment:** No issues. The report is consistent.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (slightly above zero, justified by broad exception handling). \n- **Confidence:** 1 — high confidence.\n- **Assessment:** No issues. The slightly elevated securityRisk score is acceptable due to silent exception handling, but it does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; standard system info retrieval.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — acceptable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No issues. The broad exception handling is noted but not malicious.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores are 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; scores are 0.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero due to broad exception handling, but not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- The code is a straightforward, legitimate utility function.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent.\n- The minor security risk is due to broad exception handling, which is common but could be improved for robustness.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minor concern over broad exception handling, but not significant.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, and the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. No adjustments necessary.",
