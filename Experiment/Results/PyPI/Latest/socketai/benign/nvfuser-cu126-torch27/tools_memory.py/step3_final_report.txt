  "purpose": "Retrieve available system memory in GB, using psutil if available, otherwise reading /proc/meminfo.",
  "sources": "psutil.virtual_memory().available and /proc/meminfo file reading",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; system info retrieval only",
  "flows": "Source: system memory info -> Function return value",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling (except:) silently suppresses errors; no malicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code performs a legitimate system resource check, attempting to use psutil and falling back to reading /proc/meminfo. Exception handling is broad but benign, intended to ensure fallback operation. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and readable, with no obfuscation. The exception handling could be improved for robustness but does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility function for system memory retrieval. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are detected. The current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) reflecting the broad exception handling.",
