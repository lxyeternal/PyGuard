  "purpose": "To retrieve the available system memory in gigabytes.",
  "sources": "Import of psutil module; reading from /proc/meminfo file.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage if memory info is transmitted elsewhere (not shown in this code).",
  "flows": "Import psutil -> get memory info from psutil or fallback to reading /proc/meminfo.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad except clauses which suppress exceptions; no suspicious code behavior or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The function attempts to obtain available system memory using the psutil library, which is a common system utility library. If psutil is unavailable or an exception occurs, it reads /proc/meminfo directly for Linux systems. The code only reads system info and returns a numerical value. No external network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The broad exception handling could hide errors but does not introduce malicious behavior. The SPDX license comments are standard licensing information, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for querying available system memory, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs system information retrieval without any suspicious activity.",
