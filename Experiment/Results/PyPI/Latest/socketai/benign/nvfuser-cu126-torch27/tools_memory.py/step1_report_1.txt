{
  "purpose": "The function retrieves the available system memory in gigabytes, supporting multiple platforms/methods.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'psutil' library; reads from '/proc/meminfo' file.",
  "sinks": "None identified that lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system or library calls to the return statement; no untrusted data input flows to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; exception handling is broad but benign; no obfuscated code or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to use the 'psutil' library to retrieve memory info. If that fails, it reads from the '/proc/meminfo' file directly. Both approaches are standard for system resource monitoring. No external or untrusted input is processed, and no sensitive data or commands are being executed or transmitted. The broad exception handling does not mask malicious intent but could suppress errors silently. Overall, the code performs a legitimate system monitoring task with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility function for fetching available memory on a system, with no malicious behavior detected.",
