  "purpose": "Retrieve version information, environment configuration, and system details for version management and environment introspection.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, executing subprocess commands to obtain git hash, cmake prefix path, and distributed usage, reading version.txt, and writing version info to a file.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing fixed Python commands, file operations for reading and writing version data.",
  "flows": "Subprocess commands run fixed Python code snippets; environment variables are read and validated; version info is read from a file and written back.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess with '-c' to execute Python code could be risky if inputs are compromised, but in this code, commands are fixed and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard version retrieval and environment querying tasks. Subprocess calls execute fixed Python snippets, not accepting untrusted input. Environment variables are validated before use. No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets are present. File operations are standard. The subprocess calls, while executing code dynamically, are controlled and do not pose significant risk in this context. Overall, the code is benign, intended for version management, with minimal security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, straightforward utility for version and environment info gathering. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The slight security risk from subprocess calls executing code is controlled and minimal. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2).",
