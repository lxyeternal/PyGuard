  "purpose": "Define a file path for the 'nvfuser' CMake directory based on the current file location.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)), os.path.join()",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data sinks or external data usage identified)",
  "flows": "Retrieving directory path → constructing a path string",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and defines a list __all__ for export. It calculates a path relative to the current file's directory using os.path.dirname(__file__) twice, then joins subdirectory segments 'nvfuser/share/cmake/nvfuser'. The purpose appears to be setting a directory path for configuration or data access. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The code is straightforward and standard for project setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard path construction for project configuration without malicious intent. No malicious behavior, malware, or security issues are detected.",
