{
  "purpose": "Constructs a filesystem path relative to the current file location for the 'nvfuser' component within the project directory structure.",
  "sources": "The code reads the special variable __file__ to determine the current file's path.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; the code only constructs a path without data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "Source (__file__) -> os.path.dirname -> os.path.join -> cmake_prefix_path",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward path construction with no obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, defines a list __all__, and constructs a path by moving two directories up from __file__ and appending specific subdirectories. It performs standard filesystem operations without any network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution. The logic is simple, clear, and aligns with common configuration practices. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard path setup snippet with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its safety, and the scoring reflects this. No modifications are necessary.",
