  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code imports the `os` module.\n- It defines a list `__all__` containing `\"cmake_prefix_path\"`.\n- It constructs the variable `cmake_prefix_path` by navigating two directories up from the current file's location (`__file__`) and then appending `\"nvfuser/share/cmake/nvfuser\"`.\n\n**Security considerations:**\n- The code performs straightforward filesystem path construction.\n- There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution.\n- The use of `__file__` and `os.path` functions is standard practice for configuration or resource path setup.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n**Review of the reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple path setup snippet with no malicious intent.\n- They assign a very high confidence level (mostly 1, some 0.9) that the code is benign.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or security risks are identified.\n- Malware scores are all zero, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- The reasoning in each report is consistent and accurate.\n\n**Scores and their appropriateness:**\n- Given the straightforward nature of the code, the malware score should be 0.\n- Obfuscated score should be 0, as there is no obfuscation.\n- Risk score should be very low, close to 0, since there's no security concern.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- The reports do not assume any malicious intent; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No changes needed in the scoring; the current scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard configuration snippet for path setup.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behavior is present.\n- The scores assigned are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, as it's just path setup, but acknowledging that any code can have potential risks if misused, though not here)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, straightforward, and has no security issues. The reports are accurate, and no modifications to scores are necessary.",
