{
  "purpose": "This module translates exclusion rules into a structured format for further processing, likely for filtering or validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input is received via the 'raw_rules' parameter, which can be a string or sequence of strings, and is processed through functions such as generate_rules and _format_raw_rules.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any direct data sinks or actions that would process or transmit untrusted data beyond transforming input into rule objects. No data is sent over networks or written to files.",
  "flows": "Input raw_rules -> _format_raw_rules (formats string) -> generate_rules (parses and creates Rule objects with types and expressions) -> returns structured rules.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard string manipulation and rule parsing without any suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present. No use of insecure functions or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code provides rule parsing functionality, converting raw string rules into a structured list of Rule dataclass instances. It handles various formats, applies regex-based formatting, and converts specific rule expressions for pattern matching. There are no apparent security issues, malicious behaviors, or supply chain risks. The code mainly focuses on data parsing and transformation, with no external communications, system modifications, or secret handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate rule parsing utility without any malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It neither reads nor writes sensitive data insecurely nor performs network or system actions that could be malicious.",
