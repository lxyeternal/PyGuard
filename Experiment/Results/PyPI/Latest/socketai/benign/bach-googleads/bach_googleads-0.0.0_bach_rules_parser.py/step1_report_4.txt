  "purpose": "This module parses and generates rules for exclusion criteria, converting raw string rules into structured Rule objects for further processing.",
  "sources": "Input: raw_rules parameter in generate_rules function, which can be a string or sequence of strings. Also, data from regex substitutions in _format_raw_rules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations. No network, file, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Input raw_rules -> _format_raw_rules (parsing and cleaning) -> generate_rules (splitting and processing) -> output list of rules with types and expressions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or misleading variable usage. Functions perform straightforward parsing and substitution tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data structure for rules and functions to parse raw rule strings into structured Rule objects, applying regex-based formatting and conversions for specific expressions. There are no indications of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The only operations involve string manipulation and data structuring, which are benign in this context. The regex substitutions are for formatting purposes, not for malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate parsing and formatting of rules with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a standard rule processing utility with no security risks identified.",
