  "purpose": "Parser and formatter for exclusion rules, converting raw string rules into structured Rule objects with support for logical operators and default rule types.",
  "sources": "Input raw rules as string or sequence of strings, which are then processed and formatted.",
  "sinks": "None; the code performs in-memory string processing and object creation without external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Raw rule strings -> regex formatting and splitting -> rule type and expression parsing -> Rule object creation -> list of rule lists.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Regex replacements are standard string manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward rule parser that handles string formatting, splitting by logical operators, and converting specific substrings into regex patterns. It does not perform network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The regex operations are benign, aimed at formatting rules for further processing. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's purpose is purely to process rule definitions, with no external dependencies or side effects. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are consistent with the benign, transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for parsing and formatting rules, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk and malware scores are appropriate, and the overall assessment aligns with the code's functionality. No further action is necessary.",
