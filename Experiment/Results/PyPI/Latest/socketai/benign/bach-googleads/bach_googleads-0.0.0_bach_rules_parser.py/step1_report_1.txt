{
  "purpose": "The code converts raw string rules into structured Rule objects for exclusion criteria, supporting parsing, formatting, and conversion of rule expressions.",
  "sources": "Input raw_rules parameter in generate_rules function, which is a string or sequence of strings.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process or output data to external systems or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "Input raw_rules → _format_raw_rules (if string) → parsing rules into Rule objects, including _convert_rule_expression for specific substitutions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed. The code performs standard parsing and formatting operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs rule parsing, converting raw string rules into structured Rule objects, with support for explicit and implicit rule types, handling logical AND/OR operators. It formats raw strings by removing brackets, adding whitespace around operators, and splitting rules accordingly. The _convert_rule_expression function specifically replaces certain substrings with regex patterns, likely for validation purposes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and appears to serve a rule translation purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and designed solely for parsing and transforming rule strings into structured data. No malicious or suspicious activities are detected. It functions as a rule processing utility without external or secret operations.",
