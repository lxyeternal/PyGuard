{
  "purpose": "This module parses and converts raw exclusion rules into structured Rule objects for further processing.",
  "sources": "Input is the raw_rules parameter, which can be a string or a sequence of strings provided to generate_rules function.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code does not write untrusted data to external systems or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Input raw_rules -> _format_raw_rules (if string) -> split and parse into Rule objects with type and expression -> return structured rules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard regex manipulations and rule parsing logic are used. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code parses input rule strings, removing brackets, formatting operators with whitespace, and splitting rules by OR. It then processes each rule, handling optional rule types and defaulting to 'GOOGLE_ADS_INFO'. It converts specific substrings within rules related to letter sets into regex patterns. There are no network operations, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. All functions perform typical parsing tasks without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward parser for exclusion rules, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activities. It is a benign utility for rule processing.",
