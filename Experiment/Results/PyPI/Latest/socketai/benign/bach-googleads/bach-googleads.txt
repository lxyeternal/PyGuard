      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard rule evaluation engine with a notable security concern stemming from the use of eval() for comparison operations. While no malware or obfuscation is detected, the eval() introduces a potential vector for code injection if entity data is manipulated maliciously. The scores should reflect a low malware and obfuscated score (0), with a moderate security risk (~0.4). It is advisable to replace eval() with safer comparison methods to eliminate this risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of a notification interface with console output. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The only consideration is the potential for data leakage if 'report' contains sensitive info, but this is outside the scope of the code's security assessment. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and appropriate."

      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward plugin-based parser module with no inherent malicious activity. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of parser functions in PARSER_MAPPING. If these functions are verified and controlled, the risk remains low. Scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware at 0, obfuscation at 0, and a moderate security risk (~0.2-0.4). To improve security, validation of rule_type and parser outputs is recommended."

The primary concern is the implementation of subclasses, which could introduce malicious behavior, but this is outside the scope of the current code. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use with proper review of subclass implementations."
