{
  "purpose": "Define a base class for notification channels with a specific implementation for console output.",
  "sources": "Input data is the 'report' parameter passed to the 'send' method.",
  "inks": "The 'print(report)' statement outputs the report data to standard output.",
  "flows": "The 'send' method receives 'report' and outputs it via print, with no external or untrusted data sources in the current code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears straightforward and typical for a notification system.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class 'NotificationChannel' with an unimplemented 'send' method, enforcing subclasses to implement this method. The 'Console' subclass implements 'send' by printing the report. There are no external data sources, no user input, environment variable usage, or network interactions. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated elements are present. The code structure and logic are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe implementation of a notification system with a console output method. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
