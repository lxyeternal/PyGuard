{
  "purpose": "Define a base class for notification channels and a console implementation for sending reports.",
  "sources": "The 'send' method receives 'report' as input, which is then printed in the Console class.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(report)' statement outputs the report data; if 'report' contains untrusted data, it could be exposed or misused.",
  "flows": "Input 'report' flows into the 'send' method and is output via 'print'.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated segments. No external data sources or sinks are present beyond standard output.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class for notification channels and a simple console implementation. It accepts a 'report' object and prints it, which is typical for debugging or logging. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. No external data sources or insecure practices are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic notification framework with a console output implementation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign component.",
