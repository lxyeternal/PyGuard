{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract notification channel interface and a console implementation that outputs reports to stdout.",
  "sources": "The 'send' method receives the 'report' parameter as input.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(report)' statement outputs data to stdout, potentially leaking sensitive information if 'report' contains such data.",
  "flows": "Input 'report' flows directly into the 'print' function without modification.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; straightforward implementation with no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with an unimplemented 'send' method and a concrete subclass that prints the report. There are no external data sources, network activity, or credential handling. The use of 'print' is standard for logging but could leak sensitive data if 'report' contains such info. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security flaws are present. The code is simple, clear, and aligns with typical notification patterns. The potential data leakage is a usage concern, not a security flaw.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of a notification interface with console output. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The only consideration is the potential for data leakage if 'report' contains sensitive info, but this is outside the scope of the code's security assessment. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and appropriate.",
