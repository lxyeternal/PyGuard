{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract notification channel class and a console implementation that outputs reports to standard output.",
  "sources": "The 'send' method receives the 'report' parameter as input.",
  "sinks": "The 'send' method prints the 'report' to the console, which could be a vector for outputting data.",
  "flows": "Input 'report' flows from the 'send' method to the 'print' function, outputting data to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and uses standard Python features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class for notification channels with an unimplemented 'send' method. The 'Console' subclass implements 'send' by printing the report, which is a typical logging/output pattern. No input validation, data sanitization, or external data sources are present. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs are detected. The code appears to serve a simple notification purpose without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic notification framework with a console output implementation. It poses no security threats, malware, or malicious behavior. The design is standard, with no suspicious activity or anomalous code detected.",
