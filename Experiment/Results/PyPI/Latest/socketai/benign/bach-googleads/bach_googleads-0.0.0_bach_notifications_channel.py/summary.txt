  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of a notification interface with console output. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The only consideration is the potential for data leakage if 'report' contains sensitive info, but this is outside the scope of the code's security assessment. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and appropriate."
