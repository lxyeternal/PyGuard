  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns. License comments are standard, and the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module that imports a class and defines module metadata such as version and exports. No user input, network calls, or dynamic code execution observed. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The comments and license information are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a benign part of a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module defining a class import and metadata, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a legitimate, non-malicious code snippet with no suspicious elements.",
