  "purpose": "The code provides an abstraction layer for task management in Google Ads, intended for simplifying Google Ads solutions development.",
  "sources": "Import from bach._bach module, license comments, and version declaration.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows involving untrusted sources; mainly imports and metadata definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; comments, license info, and straightforward import statements are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains license comments, documentation, and a simple import statement for a module called bach._bach. There are no runtime input sources, no data processing, no handling of user input or external data, and no code execution or network activity. The import is from a local or package module, which is typical. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. Overall, this appears to be a benign, straightforward package header and interface setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, well-documented module setup for Google Ads task management, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
