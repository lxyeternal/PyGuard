{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal setup module for a Google Ads management library, exposing the 'Bach' class from an internal module.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from bach._bach import Bach' as the source of external data or code dependency.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform external communication; the code does not handle user input or network operations.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing 'Bach' from 'bach._bach' and exposing it via __all__, with no data processing or untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup with license comments, a single import, and module metadata. It contains no dynamic code execution, external communication, or data handling. The import path appears legitimate, and the code's simplicity indicates no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It functions as a standard module initializer for a Python package, and all signals point to a safe, well-structured component.",
