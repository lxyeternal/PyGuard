  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exposes a class",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures are detected",
  "analysis": "The script is a minimal module that imports a class and defines module-level variables. It includes licensing information, comments, and a public API declaration. No user input, external data reading, or untrusted data processing is present. The code does not contain dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The only external dependency is the 'bach._bach' module, which appears to be part of the intended package structure. Overall, the code is straightforward and does not exhibit any security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, well-structured module intended for task management in Google Ads, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
