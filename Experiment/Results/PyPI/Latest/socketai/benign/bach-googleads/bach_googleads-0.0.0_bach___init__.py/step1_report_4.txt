  "purpose": "The code provides an abstraction layer for managing Google Ads tasks via the Bach library, aimed at simplifying Google Ads solutions development.",
  "sources": "Import of 'Bach' from the bach._bach module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "The code imports the Bach class, making it available for external use; no data flow from untrusted sources is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a future import and standard licensing comments but no unusual or suspicious code patterns. The version number indicates a very early release; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initialization with licensing, documentation, and import statements. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as code injection, data leakage, or backdoors. The import of a library 'bach._bach' is typical for module setup, and no dynamic or suspicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, standard module setup for a Python package, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
