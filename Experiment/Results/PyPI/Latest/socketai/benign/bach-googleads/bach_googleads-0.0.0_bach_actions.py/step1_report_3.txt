  "purpose": "Define an enumeration 'Action' with specific constant values for categorization or control flow.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'enum' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, data leakage points, or security-sensitive sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is only defining an enum.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and typical for defining enums.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'enum' module and defines an enumeration class 'Action' with four named constants. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors. The license header is standard and specifies open-source licensing. Overall, the code appears to be a simple, benign enum definition with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a basic, harmless enum class definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
