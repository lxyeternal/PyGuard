  "purpose": "Define an enumeration 'Action' with specific constant values for use in other parts of the software.",
  "sources": "Import statement for the 'enum' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behavior observed. The license header is standard, and the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'enum' module and defines a simple enumeration class 'Action' with four members. There are no functions, no input handling, no external data processing, and no side effects. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are evident. The license header indicates compliance with open-source licensing but does not suggest malicious intent. Overall, the code is a basic, safe enumeration definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard enumeration class definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign part of a larger codebase, serving as a simple data structure.",
