  "purpose": "Define an enumeration 'Action' for different operational commands or statuses.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'enum' module from the Python standard library.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input points or output points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since the code only defines an enum class.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward enumeration definition; no unusual or suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the standard 'enum' module and defines an enumeration 'Action' with four members. No external inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution is present. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected. The licensing comments are standard and do not influence security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple enumeration definition with no malicious intent, no security risks, and no obfuscation. It appears safe and standard.",
