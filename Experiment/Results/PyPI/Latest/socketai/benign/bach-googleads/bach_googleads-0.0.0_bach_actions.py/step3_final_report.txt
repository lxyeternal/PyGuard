  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration 'Action' with four specific members for categorizing actions.",
  "sources": "Standard import of 'enum' module; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static code with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; license header is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static enum class definition with four members, imported from the standard library. It contains no dynamic code, input/output, or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these scores. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward enum definition with no security risks, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
