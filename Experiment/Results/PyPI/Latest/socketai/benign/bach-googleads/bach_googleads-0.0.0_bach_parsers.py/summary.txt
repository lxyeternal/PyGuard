  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward plugin-based parser module with no inherent malicious activity. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of parser functions in PARSER_MAPPING. If these functions are verified and controlled, the risk remains low. Scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware at 0, obfuscation at 0, and a moderate security risk (~0.2-0.4). To improve security, validation of rule_type and parser outputs is recommended."
