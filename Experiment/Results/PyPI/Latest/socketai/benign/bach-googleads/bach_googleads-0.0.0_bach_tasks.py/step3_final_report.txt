{
  "purpose": "Defines data classes and enums for task scheduling, execution tracking, and related utilities, facilitating task management within an application.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from class attributes such as 'schedule', 'creation_date', 'customer_ids', and method parameters; no external untrusted data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external system calls; code primarily performs internal data processing and schedule calculations.",
  "flows": "Uses class attributes and methods to process scheduling parameters, convert data types, and generate cron expressions; no external data flow or malicious data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'datetime.datetime.now()' as default value for 'creation_date' is acceptable due to 'default_factory', no suspicious or obfuscated code present, and no hardcoded secrets or external data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of task scheduling and tracking using standard libraries and patterns. It employs safe practices such as 'default_factory' for mutable defaults and proper enum conversions. No network calls, code injection, or malicious patterns are present. The logic for cron schedule generation is correct and based on simple arithmetic. The code does not execute untrusted input or perform any suspicious operations. All security considerations are standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured task management module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assessments in all reports are accurate and consistent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) is appropriate given the code's nature.",
