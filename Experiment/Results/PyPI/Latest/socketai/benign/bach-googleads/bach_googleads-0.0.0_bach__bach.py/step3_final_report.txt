  "purpose": "Manage fetching, processing, and notification of Google Ads reports with rule-based exclusions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for configuration (GOOGLE_ADS_YAML_PATH), external API calls, user input via method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Notification channels for report delivery, external API interactions, environment variables for credentials.",
  "flows": "Fetch report using API client -> apply rules and exclusions -> generate report -> notify via channel.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Minor coding inconsistencies (e.g., return self in add_action method) are style issues, not security concerns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured automation class for managing Google Ads reports, relying on environment variables for configuration, which is standard. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The malware score is 0, aligning with the absence of malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear. The security risk score is low (~0.2-0.3), reflecting typical operational risks associated with environment variable reliance. Minor coding bugs exist but do not impact security. Overall, the code appears legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured automation framework with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating a safe and transparent implementation.",
