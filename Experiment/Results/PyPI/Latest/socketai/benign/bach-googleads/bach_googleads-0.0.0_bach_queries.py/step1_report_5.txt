  "flows": "None; static query strings are stored in a dictionary without data flow or dynamic execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; queries are hardcoded static strings, and no suspicious code behaviors are present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary with static SQL query strings for different performance reports. It contains no input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no network or file operations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The license header indicates open-source intent, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign collection of predefined SQL query templates for data retrieval in an advertising analytics context. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
