  "purpose": "Define default SQL query templates for various performance metrics reports related to advertising campaigns",
  "sources": "Constant definitions for SQL query strings in the DEFAULT_QUERIES dictionary",
  "sinks": "None present; the code only defines static query strings without executing or passing data to external sources",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets static strings",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; all queries are static strings with no dynamic input or code execution",
  "analysis": "The code contains a dictionary with predefined SQL query templates for various report types. It includes no user input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity. All queries are static, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The code appears to serve as configuration or constants for data retrieval in a larger system. No suspicious behaviors, credentials, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward collection of static SQL query templates intended for data reporting. It poses no security threats, malware, or malicious intent based on its content.",
