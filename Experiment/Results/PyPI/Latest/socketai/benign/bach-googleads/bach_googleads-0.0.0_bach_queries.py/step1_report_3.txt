  "purpose": "Define default SQL query templates for performance metrics in a marketing or advertising context.",
  "sources": "The code defines a static dictionary containing hardcoded SQL query strings.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if this dictionary is used improperly; however, the code itself does not execute or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources is present; the code merely stores static strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual patterns are present. The code appears to be straightforward query templates.",
  "analysis": "The code imports no external inputs, performs no data processing or execution, and contains only static, hardcoded SQL strings. It is a simple configuration-like setup for queries. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The queries themselves do not appear to contain injections or malicious payloads; they are standard SELECT statements with fixed parameters. The license comment indicates proper licensing, and no suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a static configuration for SQL queries and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no signs of malware. It appears safe.",
