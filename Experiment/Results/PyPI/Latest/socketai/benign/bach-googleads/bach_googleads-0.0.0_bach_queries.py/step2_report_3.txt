  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as static SQL query templates stored in a dictionary.\n- No untrusted input, dynamic code execution, or network activity is present.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- The license header and structure are standard.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Are the reported issues present?**  \n   Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code contains static query strings with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n   No. The reasoning is consistent and well-supported. The reports correctly conclude that the code is benign.\n\n3. **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n   All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0. This is appropriate given the content.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports assign scores higher than 0.5, which is correct. The code does not pose any risk.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is justified. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or obfuscated payloads.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports avoid assumptions; they rely solely on the static nature of the code, which is appropriate.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0.0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0.0**  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0.0**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple, static set of SQL query templates with no dynamic or malicious components. The consistent zero scores across all reports are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- No modifications needed.\n- The code poses no security threat based on its current form.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nTreat this code as safe, with no malware or obfuscation concerns. It is a benign configuration snippet.",
