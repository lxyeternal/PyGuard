  "purpose": "Static SQL query templates for fetching advertising campaign metrics and performance data.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded query strings within the DEFAULT_QUERIES dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; queries are static and do not process external input.",
  "flows": "N/A - static queries without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains static SQL query templates stored in a dictionary, with no dynamic input, code execution, or network activity. The queries are standard SELECT statements for analytics purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or embedded secrets are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static collection of SQL query templates with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
