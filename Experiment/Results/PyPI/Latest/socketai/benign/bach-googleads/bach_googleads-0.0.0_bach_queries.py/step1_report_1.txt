  "purpose": "The code defines a set of SQL query templates for retrieving advertising campaign performance metrics from a database.",
  "sources": "The code reads static query strings stored in the DEFAULT_QUERIES dictionary.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the queries are predefined static strings.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code solely provides query templates.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes hardcoded query strings for data retrieval, but no signs of malicious activity, such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of static SQL query strings for use in data analytics or reporting functions. No user input is processed or integrated into these queries, reducing the risk of injection or data leakage. There are no obfuscated parts, suspicious behavior, or malicious code. The license header and code structure are standard for a Python module defining constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of static SQL query definitions. No malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security threats are evident.",
