{
  "purpose": "Define default SQL query templates for various performance metrics in an advertising data analysis context.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it defines static query strings within a dictionary.",
  "targets": "There are no explicit data sinks or outputs; the code appears to provide query templates for later execution.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow or untrusted data processing occurs within this snippet; it only stores predefined SQL strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code are present. The queries are standard SQL for analytics.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a dictionary with several SQL query templates, all of which are static and do not process untrusted input. The queries are designed for performance metrics and contain straightforward SELECT statements with WHERE and DURING clauses. The code includes a licensing header, no dynamic code execution, and no evidence of malicious behavior. No credentials, secrets, or external inputs are embedded. Overall, the code is a benign configuration or utility module with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static configuration for SQL query templates used in analytics. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
