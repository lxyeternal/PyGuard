  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the reported issues, their reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code: importing `__version__` from a local module and asserting its existence.\n- The code is straightforward, with no data processing, network activity, or external inputs.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic are present.\n- The assertions are standard practices for version validation and do not pose security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and evaluations:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code is correct and matches the description.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low or zero security risk scores.\n- These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports justify a risk higher than 0.1, and given the code's nature, a higher score isn't warranted.\n- The lowest possible risk score (0) is appropriate.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- No malicious activity is described or evident.\n- The malware scores of 0 are justified.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report:**\n- Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No discrepancies observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is a minimal, standard version check pattern with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation.**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code correctness:** Confirmed.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security risk:** None.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for future code snippets, but this particular code is straightforward and safe.",
