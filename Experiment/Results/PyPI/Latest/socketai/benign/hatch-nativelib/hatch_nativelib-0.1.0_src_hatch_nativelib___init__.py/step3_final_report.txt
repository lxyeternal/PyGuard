  "purpose": "Import a version string from a local module and assert its existence to ensure the version is set.",

  "sinks": "Assertion statement checking __version__",
  "flows": "Import __version__ from local module, then assertion verifies __version__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version check, no obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of __version__ and asserts its presence. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or suspicious logic. The assertion is a common pattern for version validation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The code is minimal and standard, with scores of malware and obfuscation correctly set to 0, and security risk also effectively 0. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in some reports slightly overestimates the risk but remains negligible given the benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version check pattern with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports' assessments are accurate; the malware and obfuscation scores should be 0, and the security risk score should be 0.",
