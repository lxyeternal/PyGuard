  "purpose": "Import the version string of the current package and assert its presence to satisfy linters.",
  "sources": "The import statement from ._version to get __version__.",
  "sinks": "The assert statement checks the value of __version__, but does not output or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Import of __version__ from a local module, followed by an assertion to verify its existence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward with no obfuscated elements or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the __version__ attribute from a local module. It then asserts that __version__ is truthy, which is a common practice to ensure the version is defined. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code execution. The code is minimal and typical for version checking in a package.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply checks that the __version__ variable is defined and truthy. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is very low.",
