  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Issue presence**: The code matches the description—it's a simple import and assertion.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: No logical errors or malicious code. The assertion is harmless.\n   - **Scores**: Malware score is 0, security risk is 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - **Conclusion**: The assessment is accurate.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Same as above; code is straightforward.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: No issues found.\n   - **Scores**: Malware is 0, security risk is 0.1, which might be slightly high given the benign code.\n   - **Justification for risk score**: The code does not perform any risky operations; the minor security risk might be overestimated. I suggest lowering the security risk to 0 unless there's context indicating otherwise.\n   \n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Consistent with the code.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n   - **Scores**: Malware is 0, security risk is 0, which is appropriate.\n   \n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Matches the code.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: No issues.\n   - **Scores**: Malware is 0, security risk is 0, fitting the benign nature.\n   \n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Accurate.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: No malicious activity.\n   - **Scores**: Malware is 0, security risk is 0, which is correct.\n\n**Overall assessment**:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The malware scores are appropriately zero across all reports.\n- The security risk scores are mostly zero, except for report 2, which assigns 0.1. Given the code's simplicity and lack of external data handling, I believe this is an overestimation. I recommend lowering it to 0.\n\n**My final estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 for all, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score**: 0 across the board, as the code is benign.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a standard pattern for version validation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores in the reports are mostly accurate, with a slight overestimation of security risk in report 2.",
