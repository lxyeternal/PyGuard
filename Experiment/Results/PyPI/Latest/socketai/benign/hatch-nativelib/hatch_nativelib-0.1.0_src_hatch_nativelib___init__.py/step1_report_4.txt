{
  "purpose": "The code imports a version string from a local module and asserts its existence, likely to ensure version information is available.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._version and the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Import of __version__ from local module, then assertion of its truthiness.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns; the assertion is a simple check.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the __version__ variable from a local module, which is a common practice for managing package versioning. The assertion ensures that __version__ is defined and not empty, which is a standard validation step to prevent runtime issues or improper package setup. No external input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is involved. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving a simple validation purpose for package versioning. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
