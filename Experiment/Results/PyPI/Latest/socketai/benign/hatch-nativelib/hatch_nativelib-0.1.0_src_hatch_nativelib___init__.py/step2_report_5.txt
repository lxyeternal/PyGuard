  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code snippet: importing `__version__` from a local module `_version` and asserting its existence.\n- The purpose across reports is consistent: version management or validation.\n- No report indicates any malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware, suspicious logic, or complex data flows.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  **No.** All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  **No.** The logic is simple and correct for its purpose.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. The code is not obfuscated.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1. Given the simplicity and lack of external data handling, these are reasonable.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- No issues warrant a higher score. The code is trivial and does not pose security risks.\n\n### Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- All reports correctly dismiss any potential vulnerabilities; they rely on observable facts.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- Scores are consistent with the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to 0, e.g., 0.1 for minimal concern about linter warnings)\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- The code is a standard version check snippet with no malicious or obfuscated elements.  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for the minimal concern about potential misuse, but practically none)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is benign, standard, and carries no security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
