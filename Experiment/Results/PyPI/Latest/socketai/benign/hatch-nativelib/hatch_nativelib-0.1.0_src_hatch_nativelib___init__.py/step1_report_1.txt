{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to import the package version and ensure it is defined, likely for version management or compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._version import __version__",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "N/A – there are no source-to-sink data flows in this minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'assert __version__' to make linters happy is a common pattern; it does not execute any harmful logic or produce side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a local module and uses an assert statement to verify its existence. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data handling that could pose security issues. The assert statement is straightforward and used solely for ensuring the variable is truthy, which is typical for version checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard pattern for version management with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
