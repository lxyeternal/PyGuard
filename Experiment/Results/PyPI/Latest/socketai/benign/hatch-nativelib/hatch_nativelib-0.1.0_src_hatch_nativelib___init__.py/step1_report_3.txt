  "purpose": "Import the package version and ensure it is defined for compatibility or validation.",
  "sources": "The import statement from ._version import __version__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not handle external inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "The code imports a version string and asserts its existence, with no flow involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The assert statement is used solely to prevent linters from warning about undefined __version__; no malicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the __version__ attribute from a local module, likely for version management. The assert statement ensures __version__ is truthy, which is a common practice to avoid linter warnings. No input handling, data leaks, or malicious behavior is present. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard version check with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical pattern used in Python packages for version validation.",
