{
  "purpose": "The code imports a version string from a local module and asserts that the version is defined, likely for version control or package metadata purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ variable from a local module named _version.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import __version__, then assert its existence; no complex data flow or external data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for package versioning; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a version string and asserts its presence, a common pattern for Python package modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. The assertion ensures that __version__ is defined, which helps maintain package integrity. No external data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for version management, and contains no malware or security risks. It performs a simple import and assertion with no suspicious activity.",
