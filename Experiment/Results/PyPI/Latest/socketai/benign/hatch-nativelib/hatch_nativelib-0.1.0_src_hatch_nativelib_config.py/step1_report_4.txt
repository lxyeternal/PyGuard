  "purpose": "Define a dataclass for configuration of a pkgconf file related to native libraries, including methods for path and module name handling.",
  "sources": "Initialization of class attributes, method calls within class methods",
  "sinks": "None directly, no external data sinks or untrusted output points",
  "flows": "None involving untrusted data flows; methods primarily process and validate internal data",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic; code performs straightforward validation and path manipulations",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass 'PcFileConfig' with several optional configuration attributes for a build process. It includes methods to derive file paths, validate filename formats, and generate module names based on the filename. No external data input is processed, nor is there any code that writes, transmits, or executes untrusted data. The methods perform validation checks on provided file paths and module names, raising exceptions on invalid input, which is standard and safe. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network access, code injection, or data exfiltration, are present. The code appears to be purely configuration and utility logic for file path handling.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward configuration class with methods for managing paths and module names. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It primarily validates and constructs filesystem paths and names, with no evident security risks.",
