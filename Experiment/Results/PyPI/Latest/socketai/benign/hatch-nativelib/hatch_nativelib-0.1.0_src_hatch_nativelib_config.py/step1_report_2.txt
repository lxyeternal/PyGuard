  "purpose": "Define a dataclass for configuration of PC files related to build hooks, with methods for path handling and validation.",
  "sources": "Input data: class attributes, method parameters, environment markers, and string manipulations.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; path validation and string processing are internal and safe.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily internal data handling and validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Path validation raises exceptions for absolute paths or invalid filenames, which is standard security practice. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured configuration class that manages file paths and parameters for build configuration files. It performs validation on input paths (e.g., ensuring relative paths, proper extensions), and constructs module and file paths based on provided attributes. No untrusted data flows are present, and no external network or system commands are invoked. All methods perform standard path and string manipulations with appropriate validation, indicating well-structured, safe code. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured configuration utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It validates input paths and filenames to prevent common misconfigurations. There are no indicators of malware or malicious payloads.",
