  "purpose": "Define a data structure for configuration of a package config file (.pc) and methods to process and validate file paths, names, and module identifiers.",
  "sources": "Attributes within the PcFileConfig class, especially methods that generate paths and names based on input data.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as there are no external data sinks or network operations; methods perform path and string manipulations only.",
  "flows": "Input attributes (such as pcfile, name, init_module) flow through validation and string/path generation functions, resulting in output paths and module names.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Validation checks on pcfile paths and module names are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass with optional configuration parameters and several methods to derive paths and names. Validation checks prevent absolute paths and enforce file extension rules. The get_init_module method transforms the filename into a Python identifier, with validation. No external data sources, network calls, or hidden behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward configuration class with validation logic for file paths and names. No signs of malicious or suspicious behavior are evident. It is a standard utility class for configuration handling.",
