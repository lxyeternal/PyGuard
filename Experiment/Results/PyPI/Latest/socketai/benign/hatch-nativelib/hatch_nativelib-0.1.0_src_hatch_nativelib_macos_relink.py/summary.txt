  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for fixing dylib linking issues in macOS Python packages. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1–0.2) reflects the inherent risks of binary modifications but is justified given the legitimate purpose."
