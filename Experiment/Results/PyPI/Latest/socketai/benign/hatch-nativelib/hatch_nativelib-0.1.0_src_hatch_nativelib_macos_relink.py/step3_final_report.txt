{
  "purpose": "The code manages relinking of shared libraries (dylibs) on macOS for Python packages, adjusting RPath and install names to ensure correct dynamic linking during development and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads package information via pkgconf, filesystem paths, and get_install_names; inspects and modifies binary install names.",
  "sinks": "Calls external functions (_set_install_name) to modify binary install names; logs relinking actions.",
  "flows": "Reads package dependencies and library paths, calculates relative or absolute paths, and updates install names accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard path manipulations and binary modifications.",
  "analysis": "The script performs legitimate relinking of macOS dylibs by adjusting install names and RPaths, using standard tools and filesystem checks. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration activities. The print statements serve as logs. External functions are assumed to perform safe binary modifications. The logic is straightforward and aligns with common practices for fixing library paths in packaged software.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for fixing dylib linking issues in macOS Python packages. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1–0.2) reflects the inherent risks of binary modifications but is justified given the legitimate purpose.",
