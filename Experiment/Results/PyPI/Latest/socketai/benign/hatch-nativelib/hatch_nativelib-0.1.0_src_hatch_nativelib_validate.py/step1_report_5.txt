{
  "purpose": "The code defines utility functions for handling validation errors and parsing input data based on specified types, primarily to facilitate data validation and error reporting.",
  "sources": "The code reads data indirectly via the 'value' parameter in parse_input, which is passed to validobj.validation.parse_input, and from errors.ValidationError instances during exception handling.",
  "sinks": "The code raises exceptions with detailed error messages, but does not write data to external systems, access environment variables, or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' flows into validobj.validation.parse_input, and validation errors are captured, processed, and converted into ValidationError instances with detailed messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The code relies on external validation modules but does not show malicious behavior itself. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious network activity are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation error handling by wrapping errors from 'validobj.validation.parse_input' into a custom ValidationError with detailed context. The functions handle errors gracefully and do not perform any unsafe or suspicious operations. The use of exception chaining and error message construction is typical and appears safe. No signs of malicious or obfuscated code are present. External dependencies are used for validation, which is common practice. Overall, the code focuses on error handling and data parsing without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility module for validation error handling and input parsing. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The logic is standard, and no anomalies or suspicious activity are detected.",
