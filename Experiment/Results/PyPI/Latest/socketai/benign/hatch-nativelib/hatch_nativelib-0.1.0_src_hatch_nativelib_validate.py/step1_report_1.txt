{
  "purpose": "The code provides validation error handling and input parsing functions, primarily for validating data structures according to specifications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the parse_input function, which takes a value parameter. It also accesses error objects from validobj.validation and errors modules.",
  "sinks": "The code raises ValidationError exceptions containing formatted error messages. No untrusted data is written to external systems or exposed externally within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into parse_input, which calls validobj.validation.parse_input. If validation errors occur, errors are caught, transformed, and raised as ValidationError with detailed messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated or unusual code structures. External modules are used for validation, and their behavior is assumed safe.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly manages validation errors by converting internal errors into user-friendly exceptions. It calls an external validation function and processes error chains. The code is straightforward, with standard exception handling and message formatting. No suspicious data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious code patterns are present. Use of the external validation module is assumed safe, with no signs of malicious modifications or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard validation utility with proper error handling. It does not contain malicious code or behaviors. The security risk is very low, with no evident security issues or malware. The code's purpose is validation and error reporting, with no malicious intent.",
