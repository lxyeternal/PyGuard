{
  "purpose": "This code provides validation error handling and input parsing functions, wrapping external validation logic and converting validation errors into user-friendly exceptions.",
  "sources": "Reads input data, calls validation functions, and accesses error objects from external modules.",
  "sinks": "Raises formatted ValidationError exceptions with detailed messages.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into parse_input, errors are caught, converted via _convert_validation_error, and re-raised.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward validation utility that relies on external modules for validation and error definitions. It traverses chained exceptions to produce detailed error messages. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The error handling is standard, and the code does not perform network operations or data exfiltration. External dependencies are assumed safe; if compromised, risks could increase, but within this scope, no issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign validation wrapper with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified. No modifications are necessary; the code is safe and well-structured.",
