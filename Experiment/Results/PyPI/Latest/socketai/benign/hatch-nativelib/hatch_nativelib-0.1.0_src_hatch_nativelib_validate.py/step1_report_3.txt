{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for validating and converting input data based on a specified type and handling validation errors.",
  "sources": "Input data is read via the 'value' parameter in the 'parse_input' function.",
  "sinks": "The data flows from 'parse_input' to 'validobj.validation.parse_input' and potentially raises exceptions after error processing.",
  "flows": "Input data is passed to 'validobj.validation.parse_input'. If a validation error occurs, it is caught, processed, and re-raised as a 'ValidationError' with detailed context.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code relies on external libraries for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports validation modules and defines custom error handling. It wraps the validation process, converting exceptions into detailed, user-friendly errors. The error handling traverses exception causes to build contextual messages. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious data flows are detected. The dependencies used are standard for validation workflows. No network activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a straightforward validation utility with robust error handling. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe and intended for data validation purposes.",
