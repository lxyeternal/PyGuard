  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs",
  "flows": "N/A; straightforward assignment of version data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, or unusual code behaviors; standard version info definition",
  "analysis": "The code declares version-related variables and assigns static version information. It includes a TYPE_CHECKING block for type hints, which is standard practice and not suspicious. No external data input, no dynamic execution, no potential for malicious data flow. It is a typical version info file generated by setuptools-scm, with no indicators of malicious intent or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard version information module with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
