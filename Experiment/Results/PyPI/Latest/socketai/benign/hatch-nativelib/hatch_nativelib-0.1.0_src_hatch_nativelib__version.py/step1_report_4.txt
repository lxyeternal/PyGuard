{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, and manages version data for package distribution and type checking.",
  "sources": "The code sources version strings and tuples assigned directly within the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process external input or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code only assigns static version information to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present. The use of TYPE_CHECKING is standard for type hints, and all data is statically assigned.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard auto-generated version module that defines version variables. It uses conditional type checking imports and assigns static version information. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious code constructs. The overall structure is typical for such generated files and poses no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign version declaration script with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
