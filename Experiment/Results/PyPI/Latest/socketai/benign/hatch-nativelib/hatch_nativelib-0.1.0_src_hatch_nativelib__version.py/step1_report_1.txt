{
  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, conditional import for type checking",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or external data sources",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; primarily static variable assignments",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard versioning code structure",
  "analysis": "The code initializes versioning variables and tuples with fixed string and tuple literals. The conditional import for type checking is standard practice and does not involve any runtime behavior that could be malicious. The code explicitly states it's generated by setuptools-scm and instructs not to modify it. There are no dynamic code execution, data leaks, or suspicious activities present.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign versioning boilerplate code generated by a standard tool. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
