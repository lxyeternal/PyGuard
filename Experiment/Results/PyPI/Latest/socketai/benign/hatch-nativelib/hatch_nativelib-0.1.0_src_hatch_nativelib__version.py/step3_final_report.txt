{
  "purpose": "Standard version metadata assignment generated by setuptools-scm, serving as a static version indicator for the package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static version strings and tuples; conditional import for type checking.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external inputs, or outputs are processed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignments with no dynamic or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, auto-generated boilerplate with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated version module with no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or malicious intent. It assigns fixed version information and includes a conditional import for type hints, which is standard practice. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or external communications are present. The code's simplicity and purpose as a version indicator imply no security risks or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static version metadata module. All signals indicate no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero and should remain unchanged.",
