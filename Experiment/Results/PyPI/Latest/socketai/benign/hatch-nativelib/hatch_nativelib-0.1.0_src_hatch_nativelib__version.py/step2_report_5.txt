  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Content**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward versioning boilerplate generated by setuptools-scm.\n   - The code only assigns static version strings and tuples, with conditional type checking imports.\n   - No dynamic code execution, external data sources, or untrusted input handling are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - They appropriately dismiss the possibility of malicious activity based on the static, generated nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These are reasonable given the code's static and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - Since all scores are 0, there's no need for justification.\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could pose security risks.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:\n   - The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they rely on code analysis and context.\n   - They correctly identify the code as auto-generated version metadata, not malicious.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Overall Evaluation and Final Recommendations**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk Score**: Should remain at **0**.\n\n**Final Justification**:\n- The code is standard, static, generated version info with no dynamic or external data processing.\n- No malicious or obfuscated behavior detected.\n- The environment and context (auto-generated version info) do not warrant concern.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate** aligns with the reports:  \n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis code is benign and poses no security risk.",
