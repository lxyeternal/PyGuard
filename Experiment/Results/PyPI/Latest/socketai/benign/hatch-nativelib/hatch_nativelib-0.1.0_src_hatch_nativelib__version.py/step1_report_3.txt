  "purpose": "Define and expose version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, importing TYPE_CHECKING, and setting __all__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; all variables are assigned static values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution. The code is straightforward version info setup.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes version metadata for a Python package, with static assignments and conditional typing imports. No input, output, or data flow from untrusted sources is detected. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present. The use of TYPE_CHECKING and static version strings aligns with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical version declaration snippet generated by setuptools-scm, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
