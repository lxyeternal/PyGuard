{
  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a Python package, including version strings and tuples, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings (__version__ and version), conditional import of typing for type hints.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected. No data input/output or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version strings and tuples from hardcoded values; no flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hints is standard; no suspicious or unusual code structures. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares version information variables with static values, with a conditional import for type hints during static analysis. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, and no execution of untrusted data. The code appears standard for package versioning metadata. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign versioning metadata file generated by setuptools-scm. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, and its purpose is solely to store version information.",
