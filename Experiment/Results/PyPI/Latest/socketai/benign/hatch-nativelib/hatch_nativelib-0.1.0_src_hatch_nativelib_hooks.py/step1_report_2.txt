  "purpose": "Register a build hook for the hatchling plugin system by returning a custom hook implementation.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing 'hookimpl' from 'hatchling.plugin' and 'NativelibHook' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code only defines and registers a hook.",
  "flows": "Import 'hookimpl' -> define 'hatch_register_build_hook' -> return 'NativelibHook'. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs detected. The code performs a typical plugin registration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a plugin decorator and a hook class, then defines a function decorated with 'hookimpl' that returns 'NativelibHook'. This pattern is standard in plugin systems. No external data is processed or transmitted. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The code appears to be a straightforward plugin registration routine.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply registers a build hook for a plugin system. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
