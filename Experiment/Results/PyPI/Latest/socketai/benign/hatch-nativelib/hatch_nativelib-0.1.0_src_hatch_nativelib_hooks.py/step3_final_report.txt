  "purpose": "Registering a build hook in the hatchling plugin system by returning the NativelibHook class.",
  "sources": "Import from hatchling.plugin, import of NativelibHook from local module.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing NativelibHook class; no untrusted data flow or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Function hatch_register_build_hook() returns NativelibHook directly; no complex data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward plugin registration pattern, importing necessary components and returning a class. No external data, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, though the risk score could be slightly lowered to 0 given the simplicity. Confidence levels are high, indicating certainty of benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign plugin registration snippet with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The current scores are appropriate, but the risk score can be conservatively adjusted to 0 for maximum accuracy.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
