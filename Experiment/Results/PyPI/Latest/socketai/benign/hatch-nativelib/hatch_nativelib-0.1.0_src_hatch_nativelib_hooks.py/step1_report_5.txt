  "purpose": "Registering a build hook for the Hatchling plugin system, likely to extend or modify build behavior.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'hookimpl' from 'hatchling.plugin'.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing 'NativelibHook', which may be used as a build hook in the plugin system.",
  "flows": "Import of 'hookimpl' -> Registration function returns 'NativelibHook' object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed. No obfuscation or hidden logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a plugin registration decorator from a known plugin system (hatchling). It defines a function that registers 'NativelibHook' as a build hook. The code is minimal, straightforward, and aligns with typical plugin registration patterns. No network calls, data leaks, or malicious logic are present. No obfuscation or malicious anomalies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple plugin registration snippet with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate extension point for the hatch build system.",
