  "purpose": "Build hook for managing native libraries, configuration files, and platform-specific relinking in Python packaging.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, external subprocess calls to 'pkgconf', file I/O for configuration and shared libraries, dynamic library loading via ctypes.",
  "sinks": "File writes for configuration files, dynamic import and loading of shared libraries, subprocess execution, environment-dependent logic.",
  "flows": "Source inputs from environment variables and external commands flow into file generation, library loading, and conditional relinking processes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Use of subprocess and dynamic evaluation is standard but should be trusted in controlled environments.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build operations: generating configuration files, managing shared libraries, platform-specific relinking, and dynamic library loading. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External tool reliance ('pkgconf') and environment evaluation via 'Marker' are typical in build scripts. No signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities are evident. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate and standard build utility for managing native libraries in Python packaging. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
