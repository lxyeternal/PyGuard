{
  "purpose": "The script performs data validation and correction on a dataset using PySpark, loading rules from a JSON file, validating data, generating reports, and optionally rectifying data.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a CSV file at /path/to/forecast_data.csv and loads rules from dq_engine/config/rule_registry.json.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to a JSON summary and HTML report in ./dq_output, and rectified data is saved as a Parquet file at /path/to/cleaned_output.",
  "flows": "Input data from CSV and JSON rules flow into validation and rectification processes; validated or rectified data is then written to output files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code uses standard library calls and third-party modules without obfuscation or suspicious code snippets. No network connections or data exfiltration code are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses PySpark for data processing, with external rules loaded from a JSON file. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or backdoors are evident. File paths are static and appear to be local, with no indication of external network communication or data exfiltration. The code follows standard data validation and reporting patterns. Since the code solely interacts with local files and standard libraries, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, it appears to be a typical data validation workflow without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data validation and correction script using PySpark. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms. The overall security risk is minimal, and there are no indications of malware or supply chain sabotage.",
