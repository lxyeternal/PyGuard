  "purpose": "Standard data validation, reporting, and rectification pipeline for CSV data using PySpark and custom modules.",
  "sources": "Reading CSV file from a hardcoded local path; loading rules from a JSON configuration file.",
  "sinks": "Writing JSON and HTML reports; optionally writing rectified data to a parquet file.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from CSV -> validated against rules -> reports generated -> if not blocked, data is rectified -> output written to files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded file paths are benign; no obfuscation, network activity, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical data validation and reporting tasks with explicit file paths and standard library usage. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. External modules are used legitimately. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The minimal security risk stems from hardcoded paths, which are not security vulnerabilities but could be considered configuration concerns. Overall, the code is a standard, safe data processing script with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated components. The low security risk score is appropriate. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code analysis.",
