{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform data quality validation, reporting, and rectification on a dataset using PySpark and custom data quality libraries.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV dataset from a specified file path and loads JSON rules from a configuration file.",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON summaries and HTML reports; writes rectified data as Parquet files to a specified directory.",
  "flows": "Reads data from CSV -> Loads rules from JSON -> Validates data with rules -> Generates reports -> Optionally applies rectification steps -> Writes cleaned data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no use of environment variables; no suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script utilizes standard PySpark functions for data loading and writing, along with custom libraries for data validation and rectification. It reads data and rules from specified files, processes them through validation routines, generates reports, and conditionally performs data rectification. All file paths are explicitly defined; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs are present. No network calls or suspicious data exfiltration code are observed. The code follows typical data processing workflows without any indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data validation and processing script with no malicious behavior or supply chain attacks detected. It uses well-known libraries and straightforward file operations without any suspicious or malicious code. The overall security risk is minimal.",
