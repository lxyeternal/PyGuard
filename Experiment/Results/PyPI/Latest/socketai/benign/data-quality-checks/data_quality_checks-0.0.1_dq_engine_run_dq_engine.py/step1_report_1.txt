{
  "purpose": "The code performs data validation, cleaning, and reporting on a CSV dataset using PySpark, with rules loaded from a JSON configuration.",
  "sources": "File system reads: /path/to/forecast_data.csv, dq_engine/config/rule_registry.json",
  "sinks": "Write outputs: ./dq_output (JSON and HTML reports), /path/to/cleaned_output (Parquet file)",
  "flows": "Data is read from CSV and JSON files; validated and possibly rectified; reports are generated; cleaned data is written back to disk",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or unusual behaviors detected. Usage of standard libraries and explicit file paths is typical. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, or code injection observed.",
  "analysis": "The script starts a Spark session, loads data and rules from specified files, performs validation with external classes, generates reports, and optionally applies data rectification before saving the cleaned data. All operations involve standard data processing workflows with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious actions. File paths are hardcoded but benign. No external network activity, credential handling, or code injection mechanisms are present. The code adheres to typical data pipeline structures, and the use of external libraries appears legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data validation and cleaning pipeline with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It processes data, generates reports, and saves results securely. No malicious intent detected.",
