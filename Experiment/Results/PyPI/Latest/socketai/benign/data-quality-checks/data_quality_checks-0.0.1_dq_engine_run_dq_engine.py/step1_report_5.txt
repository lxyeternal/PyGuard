  "purpose": "Data validation, reporting, and rectification for forecast data using Spark and custom validation rules.",
  "sources": "Reading CSV file from a specific path; loading rules from a JSON configuration file.",
  "sinks": "Writing JSON summary report; generating HTML report; writing rectified data to a parquet file.",
  "flows": "CSV data read -> Rules loaded from JSON -> Validation performed -> Reports generated -> Optional rectification -> Final data saved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network calls, obfuscated code, or malicious system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data validation and cleaning using Spark. It loads rules from a local JSON file, processes data, and outputs reports and cleaned data. All file paths are local or relative; no user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are directly used in a manner that could lead to malicious activity. There are no network connections, system modifications, or hidden behaviors. The code structure is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious injections. The functions used are from custom libraries but their calls appear legitimate for data processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data validation and cleaning pipeline with no indications of malicious intent or malicious code. It reads and writes data locally, performs validation, and generates reports, which is typical for such workflows.",
