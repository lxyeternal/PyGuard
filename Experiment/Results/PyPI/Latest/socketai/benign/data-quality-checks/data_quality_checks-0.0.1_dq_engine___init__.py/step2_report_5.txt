  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as only containing import statements from the dq_engine package.\n- No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The code appears to be standard setup code for a data quality system.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms straightforward import statements.\n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to report 1, no suspicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still consistent.\n- No malware or security concerns.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to previous, standard imports.\n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion, standard import statements.\n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n- No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code only consists of import statements with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with clear, straightforward import statements.\n- The risk scores are all very low or zero, which is appropriate given the context.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, as there is no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, since the code is transparent.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or very close to zero, as the code is benign.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks in this code snippet. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely import statements with no malicious or suspicious activity.",
