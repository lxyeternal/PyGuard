{
  "purpose": "The code imports various modules from the dq_engine package, likely setting up or using data quality rules, validation, reporting, and rectification functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from dq_engine.core.rule_base, dq_engine.validator.validator_service, dq_engine.reporter.summary_writer, dq_engine.reporter.html_report, dq_engine.rectifier.rectifier_service",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code solely imports modules without executing or processing external data",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or processing flows; this fragment only imports modules",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward import statements without dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of import statements from a known library 'dq_engine'. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security issues are present. Since these are module imports, they do not indicate malicious intent unless the modules themselves are malicious, which cannot be determined from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard import statements for a data quality engine framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this fragment.",
