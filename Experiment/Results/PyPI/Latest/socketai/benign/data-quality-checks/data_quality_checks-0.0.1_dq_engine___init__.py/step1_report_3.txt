  "sinks": "None present in this snippet; no data processing or output functions are called",
  "flows": "No executable data flow; only imports are present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected in import statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a structured package named dq_engine, which appears to be a data quality toolkit. There are no data inputs, outputs, or executable logic. The imports are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. Since only import statements are present, no data flow or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only module imports with no suspicious or malicious behavior. It appears to be a normal setup for a data quality system, with no indicators of malware, malicious intent, or security issues.",
