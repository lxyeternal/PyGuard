  "purpose": "Import statements for various modules of the dq_engine package, likely for data quality rule validation, reporting, and rectification.",
  "sources": "No direct data input sources are evident in the provided code; only import statements.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data transmissions are visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable here, as this is only a set of import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains import statements; no suspicious or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a structured package called dq_engine, importing classes and functions related to data quality rules, validation, reporting, and rectification. There are no inputs, outputs, or executable logic that could be exploited maliciously. The structure appears normal for a module setup.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in this snippet. It is a standard import section for a Python project, with no suspicious activities or data leaks apparent.",
