  "purpose": "This code imports modules and classes related to data quality rules, validation, reporting, and rectification, likely as part of a data quality management system.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading external modules and classes from the dq_engine package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs are evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing logic is present; only imports are shown, so no source-to-sink flows are observable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present in the import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a structured package, indicating dependencies setup. There is no executable logic, data processing, or external input handling shown. Without further code, no malicious behavior or security risks can be identified. The imports appear standard for a data quality toolkit.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The code simply imports modules necessary for data quality operations, with no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
