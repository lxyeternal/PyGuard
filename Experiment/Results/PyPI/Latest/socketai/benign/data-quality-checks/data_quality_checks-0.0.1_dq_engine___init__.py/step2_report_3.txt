  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code only consists of straightforward import statements from the dq_engine package. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data processing, or external data handling. Therefore, no issues are present in the code snippet itself.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is limited to import statements and lacks any suspicious or malicious constructs. No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the clarity of the code.  \n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable since the code is only importing modules without executing or transmitting data.  \n   - **Confidence levels:** Mostly 1, with a couple at 0.9, reflecting high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n   These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is only import statements with no execution, data flow, or external communication, there is no justification for higher risk scores. The reports' scores of 0 or 0.9 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware scores are all 0, which is correct. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, nor do the reports suggest any such activity.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They recognize that the code is just import statements and do not infer malicious intent without evidence.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk in just import statements)\n\n**My own estimates:**  \nGiven the thorough analysis, I concur with the assigned scores. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No issues or malicious behavior are present.  \n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.  \n- The code snippet is a standard module import section with no security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe overall security risk is negligible, and no further action is necessary based on this code fragment.",
