{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific modules from the dq_engine package, likely for data quality validation, reporting, and rectification tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from dq_engine.core.rule_base, dq_engine.validator.validator_service, dq_engine.reporter.summary_writer, dq_engine.reporter.html_report, dq_engine.rectifier.rectifier_service",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks or external communications",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static import statements are present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from the dq_engine package, with no dynamic execution, data processing, or network activity. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The import statements are standard and do not involve any hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or code injection. Given the simplicity and clarity, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of module import statements with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments provided are accurate and justified.",
