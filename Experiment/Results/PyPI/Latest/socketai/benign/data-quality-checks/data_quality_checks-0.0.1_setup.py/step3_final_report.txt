  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools with no malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields such as name, version, description, author, author_email, packages, install_requires, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data flows that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is static and does not involve data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical errors in description ('qulity' instead of 'quality', 'packgage' instead of 'package') but these are benign and do not impact security.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script utilizing setuptools with static metadata. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or external data processing is present. The minor typos are noted but do not constitute security issues. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and a security risk score of 0. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with minor typographical errors that do not pose security risks. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
