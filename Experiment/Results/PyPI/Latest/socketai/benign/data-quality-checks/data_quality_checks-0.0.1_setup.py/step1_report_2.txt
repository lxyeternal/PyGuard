  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup process for a Python package named 'data_quality_checks'.",
  "sources": "The setup() function and its arguments, including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "N/A – No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from the setup() call into the package building and distribution process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be standard packaging configuration with typographical errors in description and author email, which are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and uses the setup() function to define package metadata such as name, version, description, author, and dependencies. The description contains a typo ('qulity' instead of 'quality' and 'packgage' instead of 'package'), but this is not malicious. The code is straightforward and does not include any dynamic execution, external data reading, or suspicious logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The structure aligns with standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The minor typographical errors do not impact security but could be improved for clarity.",
