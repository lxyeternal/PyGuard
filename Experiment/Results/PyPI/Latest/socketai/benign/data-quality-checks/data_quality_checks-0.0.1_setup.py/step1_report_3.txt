{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'data_quality_checks'.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools; static data in setup parameters (name, version, description, author, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows into security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical errors in description ('qulity' instead of 'quality', 'packgage' instead of 'package'), but these are benign and non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setup' and 'find_packages' functions from setuptools and calls setup() with static package metadata. No user input or external data is involved. No suspicious code, dynamic execution, or obfuscation is present. The code appears to be a straightforward package configuration script, with some spelling errors in the description, but these do not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The only notable issue is the minor spelling mistakes, which are non-malicious.",
