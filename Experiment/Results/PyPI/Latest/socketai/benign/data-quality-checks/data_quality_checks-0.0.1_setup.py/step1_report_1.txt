{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for a Python package named 'data_quality_checks'.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools ('setup', 'find_packages'), package metadata (name, version, description, author, author_email), find_packages() for package discovery.",
  "sinks": "No explicit untrusted data sinks; setup configuration is static and relies on standard package setup routines.",
  "flows": "Imports and package metadata are static; no dynamic data flows or untrusted data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The description contains a typo ('qulity' instead of 'quality') but this is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools from setuptools, defines package metadata, and calls setup() with static parameters. No user input, network activity, or dynamic execution occurs. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be a straightforward package setup script. There are no anomalies or signs of obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply configures package metadata and dependencies. The typos in description do not impact security but suggest a lack of polish.",
