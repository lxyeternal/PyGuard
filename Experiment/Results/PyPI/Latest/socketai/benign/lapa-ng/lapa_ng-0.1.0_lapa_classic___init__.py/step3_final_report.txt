  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided code and reports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network connections, file I/O, user input, environment variables, standard library functions.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writing, environment variable access, potential data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into network or file sinks; no suspicious or malicious flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently identify the code as benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. Scores for malware and obfuscation are zero across all reports, aligning with the absence of suspicious patterns. Risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), justified by the lack of malicious indicators but acknowledging minor ambiguity in some reports. Confidence levels are high where code is reviewed thoroughly, moderate where code is absent. No evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation is present, and the overall security posture is low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears safe with no malicious or obfuscated code detected. The scoring is consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall security risk is minimal.",
  "confidence": 0.85,
