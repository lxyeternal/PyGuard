  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific function or task, but no explicit description is provided.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from standard input, variables, or external modules, but specific data sources are not clearly identifiable without the actual code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output functions, network communication functions, file writes, or database operations. Without code specifics, exact sinks cannot be pinpointed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input, variables) to sinks (outputs, network, storage), but specific source-to-sink paths are not identifiable without the code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies, hard-coded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are observed from the provided prompt. However, detailed code review is limited without actual code content.",
  "analysis": "The review cannot be fully completed without access to the code content. Based on the instructions, the analysis would involve checking for suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, malicious API calls, or obfuscated code. Since no code is provided, only general guidelines can be applied.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of the actual code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this review. However, a detailed analysis is necessary once code is available.",
