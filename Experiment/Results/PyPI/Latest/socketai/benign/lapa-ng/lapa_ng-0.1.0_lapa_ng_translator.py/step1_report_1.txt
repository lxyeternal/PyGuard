{
  "purpose": "This code implements a set of translation utilities for converting words into phonemes, including caching for performance optimization.",
  "sources": "Input words (Word or Word list) in the translate functions; matcher.match() in _translate_word",
  "sinks": "Yielding TranslationResult objects, cache retrieval and storage",
  "flows": "Input words → _translate_word (matching) → yielding TranslationResults; cache get/set → yield from cached results",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code appears focused on linguistic processing. No network, file, or external system interactions are present. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names. Cache usage is standard and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions to process translation results, a MatchingTranslator class that uses a matcher to generate phonemes from words, and a CachedTranslator class that adds caching to improve performance. The _collect_* functions organize results; the MatchingTranslator uses a matcher.match() call to find phonemes; the cache stores translation results keyed by word text and emit mode. There are no inputs or outputs that involve network, file, or system commands. The code does not include any hardcoded secrets, external system calls, or obfuscated constructs. The only notable behavior is caching of translation results, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a translation system with caching, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs linguistic data processing safely. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
