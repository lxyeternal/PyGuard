  "purpose": "Parse NAF files to extract word forms and their attributes for linguistic annotation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads the file path 'naf_file' provided as an argument; parses XML elements using ElementTree.iterparse.",
  "sinks": "Yields Word objects with text and attributes; no external untrusted data sinks are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Input file path -> XML parser -> extraction of 'text' and 'wf' elements -> yields Word objects with text and attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code performs straightforward XML parsing without any dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a flag to detect the 'text' tag. It uses ElementTree.iterparse to process the XML file incrementally. It marks the start of relevant content when it finds the 'text' tag and stops parsing once the 'text' element ends. It yields Word objects for each 'wf' element found during parsing, passing along text and attributes. There are no suspicious operations, data leaks, or malicious behaviors detected. The code appears to be a standard XML parsing routine with no embedded or hidden malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical XML parser for a specific linguistic data format with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms. The overall security risk is minimal.",
