  "purpose": "Parse NAF files to extract word form data as Word objects.",
  "sources": "File input via naf_file parameter, XML data read through ElementTree.iterparse.",
  "sinks": "Yielding Word objects which contain text and attributes from the XML file.",
  "flows": "Reading from the file (source) and yielding Word objects (sink) based on parsing events.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL or network activity, or obfuscated code. The code's logic is straightforward XML parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code parses an XML-based NAF file, detecting the 'text' tag to start parsing and stopping after its closing. It yields Word objects for each 'wf' element found within the 'text' section, passing the element's text and attributes. No external network, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious data handling. The implementation uses standard library functions with clear control flow. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate parsing of a specific XML format for linguistic annotation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
