  "purpose": "This module provides functionality for handling phonemes, including loading phonemes from CSV files, splitting words into phonemes, and phoneme lookup.",
  "sources": "Reading CSV file for phoneme definitions in from_csv class method.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or environment variable writes present.",
  "flows": "CSV file data is read into phoneme objects, used internally for processing words; no external data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. CSV reading is standard. No obfuscated code or code execution techniques observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily deals with phoneme data processing, including reading from a CSV, storing, and matching phonemes. CSV input is used only for data loading. There are no network operations, environment variable manipulations, or code execution features. The file reading is straightforward and limited to static data, with no signs of malicious behavior. The use of sorted phoneme lists for matching is typical. No anomalies or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard phoneme processing utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It loads data from a CSV file, processes phonemes, and provides lookup functionality. No malware, backdoors, or security risks detected.",
