{
  "purpose": "To provide functionality for handling phonemes, including loading from CSV files, splitting words into phonemes, and phoneme lookup.",
  "sources": "Reading phoneme definitions from CSV files, accepting user input in methods like get_first and split_phonemes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe use of input data in split_phonemes (e.g., raising exceptions or processing untrusted input), but no external network or file modification occurs.",
  "flows": "Input data from method arguments (word, file_path, key) flows through processing functions, with no apparent external data exfiltration or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() for file reading without security checks, but this is standard for configuration loading; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily deals with phoneme data management, including loading from CSV, phoneme lookup, and splitting words. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or execute untrusted code. Input handling is straightforward, with exception raising for invalid data, which is typical. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are evident. The CSV loading assumes trusted CSV files, which is standard. Overall, the code appears to be a typical data processing module with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard phoneme handling utility with no malicious or suspicious behaviors detected. It securely loads data, processes user input without executing external commands or network activity, and provides useful functionality without apparent security issues.",
