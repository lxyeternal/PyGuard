{
  "purpose": "To provide phoneme processing functionalities, including loading phonemes from CSV files and splitting words into phonemes.",
  "sources": "Reading CSV file containing phoneme definitions from disk",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; no network or file output beyond loading CSV",
  "flows": "Loading CSV file -> creating Phoneme objects -> phoneme list usage in methods like get_first and split_phonemes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, no backdoors or code that performs harmful operations. The only file I/O is reading a CSV file for phoneme definitions, which appears legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of phoneme handling, including loading data from a CSV, sorting, and processing phonemes. It uses safe Python practices for file reading and data handling. No suspicious logic, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The CSV reading is a standard pattern, and the code does not execute external commands or network operations. There are no hidden backdoors or privacy-invasive features.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign phoneme processing module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard data loading and processing functions without any suspicious behavior.",
