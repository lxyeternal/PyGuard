  "purpose": "Minimal CLI entry point that imports and executes the 'cli' function from the 'lapa_classic._cli' module.",

  "sinks": "Execution of 'cli()' function, which may perform various actions depending on its implementation",
  "flows": "Import of 'cli' -> call to 'cli()' when script runs as main",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected in this snippet",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing a function and executing it if run directly. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'cli()'. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. All reports correctly identify this pattern and assign low malware and obfuscation scores, with low security risk scores reflecting the minimal code. The confidence in benignity is high, but the overall risk hinges on 'cli()' behavior, which is outside this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI launcher with no signs of malicious activity. The security risk is minimal and consistent with the reports. Unless 'cli()' contains malicious code, the overall assessment remains benign.",
