  "purpose": "Invoke the 'cli' function from the 'lapa_classic._cli' module when the script is run directly.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'cli' from 'lapa_classic._cli'.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'cli()' function as the main entry point, which could execute code within that function.",
  "flows": "Import of 'cli' -> execution of 'cli()' when script runs directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and typical for CLI entry points.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a function named 'cli' from the 'lapa_classic._cli' module and executes it if the script is run as the main program. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or network activity within this snippet. The 'cli()' function's behavior cannot be determined without inspecting the 'lapa_classic._cli' module, but this code by itself appears benign and typical for CLI scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for invoking a command-line interface, with no immediate signs of malicious behavior or security issues based solely on this snippet.",
