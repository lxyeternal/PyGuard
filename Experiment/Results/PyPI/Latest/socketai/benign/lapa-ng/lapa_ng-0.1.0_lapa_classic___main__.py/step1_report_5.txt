{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes a command-line interface (CLI) function from the lapa_classic._cli module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'cli' from 'lapa_classic._cli'.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'cli()' when the script is run as main.",
  "flows": "The script calls the imported 'cli()' function upon execution, passing control to the CLI implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs present. The code is minimal and standard for executing a CLI command.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward entry point that imports a CLI function and executes it if the script is run directly. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious logic within this fragment. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'cli()' in 'lapa_classic._cli', which is outside the scope of this snippet. No data leaks, insecure practices, or malware-like behaviors are evident here.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple script entry point to run a CLI command. There is no malicious behavior detected in this fragment. Its security depends on the underlying 'cli()' implementation, which is not provided.",
