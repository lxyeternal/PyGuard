  "purpose": "To execute the CLI command defined in the lapa_classic._cli module when the script is run directly.",
  "sources": "The import statement importing cli from lapa_classic._cli; execution of cli() if the script is run directly.",
  "sinks": "The cli() function call, which may execute arbitrary commands or operations depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Import lapa_classic._cli -> Call cli() -> Execute code within the cli() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code constructs; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a CLI function from a module within the lapa_classic package and executes it if the script is run as the main module. Since the content of cli() is unknown, potential risks depend entirely on its implementation. The code itself is simple, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. Without inspecting lapa_classic._cli, we cannot determine if malicious actions occur during cli() execution.",
  "conclusion": "The script serves as a simple launcher for a CLI defined elsewhere. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident solely from this snippet. The security assessment depends on the implementation of cli(), which is outside the provided code.",
