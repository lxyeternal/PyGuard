  "purpose": "To invoke the command-line interface (CLI) function from the 'lapa_classic._cli' module when the script is run directly.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'lapa_classic._cli' module, execution trigger in '__main__' block.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'cli()' function, which may execute code defined within the imported module.",
  "flows": "Import 'cli' -> check if '__name__' == '__main__' -> call 'cli()' if true.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, the 'cli()' function's behavior is unknown without inspecting the imported module.",
  "analysis": "The script only imports a function 'cli' and executes it if the script is run directly. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns visible in this snippet. However, the behavior of 'cli()' depends entirely on the implementation in 'lapa_classic._cli'. Without inspecting that function, we cannot definitively assess whether malicious activity occurs. The current code is standard for CLI entry points, and no anomalies or malicious indicators are apparent here.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple CLI entry point, with no evident malicious intent in the provided snippet. The security assessment depends on the implementation of the 'cli()' function in the imported module, which is not available here.",
