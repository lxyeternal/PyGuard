  "purpose": "To invoke the CLI functionality from the 'lapa_classic' package if the script is run directly.",
  "sources": "Importing 'cli' from 'lapa_classic._cli' module; execution of 'cli()' in the main block.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'cli()' could potentially handle untrusted input or execute commands.",
  "flows": "Import of 'cli' -> call to 'cli()' when executed as main script.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, and the imported module's behavior is unknown but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a 'cli' function from a module within the 'lapa_classic' package and executes it if the script runs as the main program. This pattern is typical for command-line interfaces. There are no indications of obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior within this snippet. The potential security concerns depend entirely on the implementation of 'cli()' in the imported module, which is not provided here. Since the code simply delegates to 'cli()', it is not inherently malicious, but the overall security depends on that implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a straightforward entry point to a CLI tool from the 'lapa_classic' package. There is no evidence of malicious intent within this snippet itself. Security risk largely depends on the behavior of the imported 'cli()' function, which cannot be assessed here. Overall, the code appears benign based on the provided fragment.",
