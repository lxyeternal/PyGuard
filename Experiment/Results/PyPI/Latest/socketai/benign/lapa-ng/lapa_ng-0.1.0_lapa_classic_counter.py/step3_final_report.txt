{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for counting SAMPA phonetic symbols and emotional labels within text, serving as a linguistic and emotional analysis utility.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to the add, addEmotion, and addCluster methods for counting symbols and labels.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network connections, or file operations are present; all data processing occurs in-memory.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the add methods, updating internal dictionaries; no external or untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; logging used solely for debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with classes for counting phonetic symbols and emotions, using standard data structures and logging. No external dependencies, network activity, or code injection present. The logic is clear, and the code performs as intended without security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for counting phonetic symbols and emotional labels, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing security scores are appropriate and justified.",
