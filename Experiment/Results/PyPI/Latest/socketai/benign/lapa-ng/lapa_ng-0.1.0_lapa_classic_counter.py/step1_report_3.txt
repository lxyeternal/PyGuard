{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes for counting SAMPA phonetic symbols and emotional labels, likely for linguistic or sentiment analysis.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading sources; all data appears to be passed directly via method parameters or class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output destinations that handle untrusted data; logging is used for debugging and informational purposes, but no data is written to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows to potentially dangerous sinks; counting methods only update internal dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of logging is standard; no dynamic code execution or external network calls present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes, countSampa and countEmotions, for counting specific linguistic symbols and emotional categories. Both classes initialize internal dictionaries and use logging for debugging purposes. Methods update counts based on inputs; no external data sources, sinks, or network activity. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears straightforward and purpose-specific, with no signs of sabotage, data exfiltration, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign and designed for counting symbols and emotions, with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
