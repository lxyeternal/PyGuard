  "purpose": "A CLI utility for processing, translating, and validating linguistic data files (NAF files), utilizing external modules 'sampify' and 'naf' for data transformation and validation.",
  "sources": "File input paths provided via CLI options, reading NAF files, rules, and reference files; data read from external modules 'sampify' and 'naf'.",
  "sinks": "Writing output files such as counts.xls, translations.csv, validation_errors.txt; logging to files and console; no network or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input files are read; external modules process data; results are written to output files; logs are generated during processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file handling, logging setup, and calls to external modules presumed safe. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation present. External modules 'sampify' and 'naf' are used straightforwardly. The scoring of malware as 0, obfuscation as 0, and low security risk scores are consistent with the benign and transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured CLI tool for linguistic data processing with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
