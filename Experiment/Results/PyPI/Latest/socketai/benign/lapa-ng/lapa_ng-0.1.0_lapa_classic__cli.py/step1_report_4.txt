  "purpose": "The code provides a CLI tool for processing NAF files with rules, translating and counting data, and validating rules against a reference file.",
  "sources": "Reads input files specified via CLI options (NAF files, rules files, reference files, output paths). Uses the 'Path' and 'open' functions to read files. Receives command-line arguments for input data.",
  "sinks": "Writes output files including logs, translation CSV, counts XLS, validation errors. Uses 'open' for reading and writing files. Calls external modules (Sampify, naf) which could process data.",
  "flows": "Inputs are read from files via CLI options, processed through Sampify and naf objects, and results are written to output files. Data flows from input files into processing functions, then outputs are saved locally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious network activity. Logging setup is standard; no data leaks apparent. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected. External modules (Sampify, naf) are not provided, but their usage appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily orchestrates file input/output, logging, and calls to external modules for processing. It contains no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns. It does not perform any network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The functions are well-structured and use standard libraries. The code reads input data securely from specified files and writes outputs accordingly. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The only potential concern is reliance on external modules, but no malicious behavior can be inferred without their implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI tool for processing and validating linguistic data with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard libraries and patterns, and does not include malicious or suspicious code components.",
