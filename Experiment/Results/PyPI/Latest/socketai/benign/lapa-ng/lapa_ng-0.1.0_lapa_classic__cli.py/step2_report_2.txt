  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently state that the code is a standard CLI utility for processing linguistic data, with no suspicious or malicious activity.\n- The code primarily performs file I/O, logging, and calls to external modules (`sampify`, `naf`) which are assumed to be safe.\n- No network activity, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risks, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the described functionality. No discrepancies.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; no network, code injection, or exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code.\n- **External modules:** Usage of `sampify` and `naf` is standard; assuming they are safe.\n- **File handling:** Reads and writes files based on user input; no suspicious operations.\n- **Logging:** Proper setup; no secret leaks or malicious logs.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** Minimal; mainly standard file handling.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment of scores:\n\n- All reports assign **malware score = 0** — justified.\n- **Obfuscated score = 0** — justified.\n- **Risk scores:** Generally low (around 0.1 to 0.2). Given the code's nature, these are reasonable.\n\n### Any inconsistencies or unreasonable scores?\n\n- No. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, due to file handling and external dependencies, but nothing suspicious)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since it’s a CLI tool handling files, but no evident vulnerabilities)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malicious intent. The provided reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n\n- Ensure external modules `sampify` and `naf` are verified for safety.\n- No further security concerns are evident based on this code snippet.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with a very low security risk profile.",
