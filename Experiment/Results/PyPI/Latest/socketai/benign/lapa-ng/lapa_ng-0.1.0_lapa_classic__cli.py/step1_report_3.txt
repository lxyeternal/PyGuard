  "purpose": "This script provides command-line tools for processing NAF files, applying translation rules, and validating rule sets against reference data.",
  "sources": "Reads input files specified via command-line options, including NAF files, rules files, and reference files. Uses user-provided paths for output directories.",
  "sinks": "Writes logs, validation errors, translated CSV, and Excel results to user-specified directories. Writes translation CSV and counts to files in output path.",
  "flows": "Inputs (file paths) are used to instantiate objects and process data; data flows from input files through translation and validation functions, then results are saved to output files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; logging setup appears standard; no obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution detected. No network activity or hidden backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages file I/O, logging, and command-line interface commands. It uses external libraries (click, xlwt) and internal modules (sampify, naf) to perform translations and validation. All inputs are from user-specified file paths, and outputs are written to specified directories. There are no signs of malicious code, network activity, or backdoors. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are apparent. The code appears to be a legitimate CLI utility for linguistic data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard command-line utility for processing and validating language data files. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks based on the provided code. It appears safe and benign.",
