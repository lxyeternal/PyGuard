  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from stdin, environment variables, external sources, and network functions.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, environment variables, and data outputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (stdin, env vars) to sinks (network, files), potentially untrusted inputs reaching sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data processing with potential network or environment interactions but lacks evidence of malicious activity. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3) are consistent with the benign assessment, considering the potential for untrusted inputs. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited context. Overall, the code appears safe, with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation detected. The low risk score reflects cautious acknowledgment of untrusted inputs but no evidence of malicious behavior. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence.",
