{
  "purpose": "The code manages linguistic rules for phonological transformations, allowing rule addition, validation, and application based on user input and file data.",
  "sources": "Reads rule data from files (.csv, .json, .xls, .xlsx) and user prompts via input() in '_read_line_rule'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; potential risk from 'eval' in '_read_line_rule' if untrusted data is processed.",
  "flows": "User input and file data flow into '_read_line_rule' where 'eval' executes rule syntax; rules are stored internally and used for transformations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'eval' on user input and file data in '_read_line_rule' is a security concern; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a linguistic rule management system with functions for reading, validating, and applying phonological rules. The primary security issue is the use of 'eval' on user input, which could lead to code injection if rule files or inputs are malicious. No malicious activity, network communication, or obfuscation is present. The code is straightforward and intended for linguistic processing, with no evidence of malware or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and focused on linguistic rule management. The main security concern is the unsafe use of 'eval', which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. No malware or obfuscation is detected. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to 'eval' usage, warranting a risk score of 0.4.",
