  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided snippets and descriptions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, environment variable access, data processing, logging, minimal or absent code segments.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via environment variables, network connections, or file operations (not explicitly present in snippets).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., environment variables, function parameters) to outputs or external interactions (not observed).",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code segments; code is benign or minimal.",
  "analysis": "All reports describe benign, straightforward code snippets with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. Malware scores are consistently zero, reflecting no malicious intent. Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the benign nature and limited code content. Confidence levels are high where code is present (0.8-0.9) and low where code is absent or minimal (0.2-0.3). Minor score adjustments are recommended for reports with minimal content to better align risk scores with the evidence. Overall, the assessments are consistent, cautious, and appropriate given the limited information.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets and descriptions indicate benign, non-malicious code with no obfuscation or suspicious activity. Scores are appropriately conservative, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and low security risk scores. Minor adjustments to risk scores for minimal content are advisable but do not significantly alter the benign assessment.",
