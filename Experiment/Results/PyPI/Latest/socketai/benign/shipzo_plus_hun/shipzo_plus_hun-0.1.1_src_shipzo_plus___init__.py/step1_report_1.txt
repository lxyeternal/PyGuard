  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to import various modules, set up environment variables, and potentially execute or configure some functionality, possibly related to data processing or network communication.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables and imported modules. It may also read user input or configuration files if present elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections or subprocess executions, depending on subsequent code not provided here.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input sources into modules or functions, possibly reaching network or system-level operations.",
  "anomalies": "No clear anomalies are observed in the visible code. The code structure appears standard, with typical imports and environment setup. No hardcoded secrets are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements, environment variable access, and setup routines. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code. As the snippet is limited, some assumptions are made based on typical patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be a standard setup routine without suspicious or harmful behavior.",
