  "purpose": "A simple utility that reads two integers from command-line arguments, adds them, and prints the result.",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], input arguments provided via command line",
  "sinks": "print() function outputs the sum to standard output",
  "flows": "sys.argv[1] and sys.argv[2] -> int() conversions -> plus() function -> print() output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward addition code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code reads two command-line arguments, converts them to integers, adds them via the plus() function, and prints the result. It uses only standard library functions, with no external data sources, network activity, or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The logic is simple, transparent, and correct for its purpose. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code does not perform any risky operations or contain vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior, and no further issues are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for adding two integers provided via command-line arguments. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No malicious or security concerns are present, and the code can be considered safe for use.",
