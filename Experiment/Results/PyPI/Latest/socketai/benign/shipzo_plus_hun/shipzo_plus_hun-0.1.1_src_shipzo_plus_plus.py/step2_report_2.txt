  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the reports and the code:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior**  \n   All reports agree that the code is straightforward, performing a simple addition of two integers provided via command-line arguments. There are no indications of obfuscation, external data sources, network activity, or code that could be malicious.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \n   The code is minimal and correct for its purpose. No logical flaws are apparent. The reports correctly identify that the code performs a basic addition with no malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.  \n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no security concerns.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Justification**  \n   Since the code is purely arithmetic with no malicious or suspicious features, the risk and malware scores should remain at 0. The reports are consistent in this regard.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions or Claims**  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that no malicious behavior is detected.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency and Reasonableness**  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- Given the code's simplicity, no further suspicion or concern is warranted.\n- The reports are accurate in their analysis and scoring.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe current scores are appropriate and justified. The code is benign, and the reports correctly reflect that. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a straightforward utility with no security issues.",
