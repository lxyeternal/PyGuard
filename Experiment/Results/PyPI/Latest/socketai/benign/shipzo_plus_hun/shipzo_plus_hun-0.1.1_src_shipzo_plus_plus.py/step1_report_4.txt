  "purpose": "A simple command-line utility to add two integers provided as arguments.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "The output is printed to standard output using print(). No untrusted data is sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "sys.argv[1:] -> int conversions -> plus() -> print()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs basic integer addition without any unusual behavior or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to access command-line arguments, extracts the first two arguments, converts them to integers, and outputs their sum. The logic is straightforward and does not contain any malicious patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. There are no external network connections, no data exfiltration, and no dynamic code execution. The code is simple and transparent, serving a basic purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a basic addition utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely within its defined scope, processing user input and outputting a result.",
