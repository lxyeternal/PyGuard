  "purpose": "Simple command-line utility to add two integers provided as arguments",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1:], which reads command-line input arguments",
  "sinks": "print() function, which outputs the result to standard output",
  "flows": "sys.argv inputs are converted to integers and passed to plus(), then printed",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed; no obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code reads two input arguments from the command line, converts them to integers, and prints their sum. There is no use of external data sources besides command-line arguments. The functions are straightforward and do not perform any network or file operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is apparent. The code's purpose appears to be a basic arithmetic operation with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign utility for adding two numbers provided via command-line arguments. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
