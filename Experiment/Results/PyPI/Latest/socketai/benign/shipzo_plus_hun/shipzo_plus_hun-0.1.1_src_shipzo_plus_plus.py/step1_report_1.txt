  "purpose": "A simple command-line utility to add two integers provided as arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Uses int() to parse input, outputs result via print().",
  "flows": "sys.argv[1:] -> int() conversions -> plus() -> print()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code accepts two command-line arguments, converts them to integers, and prints their sum. It uses standard library functions without any suspicious or malicious logic. No external data sources or sinks are present that could be exploited for malicious purposes. The code performs a straightforward addition operation with no evident security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign program for adding two integers from command-line input. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
