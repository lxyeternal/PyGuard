  "purpose": "A simple command-line utility that reads two integer arguments and outputs their sum.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Uses print() to output the result, which is a standard output sink",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> sys.argv -> int conversion -> plus() -> print()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior; straightforward input processing",
  "analysis": "The code accepts two command-line arguments, converts them to integers, and prints their sum. No external data sources, network communication, or file manipulation is present. The code performs basic arithmetic without any obfuscated or malicious constructs. There are no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns. The logic is simple and transparent, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic arithmetic script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a simple utility for summing two integers provided as command-line arguments.",
