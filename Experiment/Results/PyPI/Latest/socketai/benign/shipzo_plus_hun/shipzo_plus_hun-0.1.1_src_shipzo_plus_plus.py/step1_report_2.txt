  "purpose": "A simple script that takes two command-line arguments, converts them to integers, adds them, and prints the result.",
  "sources": "Input data from command-line arguments (sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "The print() function outputs the result; no untrusted data sink that leads to security risk is involved.",
  "flows": "User input (sys.argv) -> Conversion to integers -> Addition -> Output via print().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code constructs. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code reads two command-line arguments, converts them to integers, and outputs their sum. The process is straightforward with no complex data flows or external data sources other than user input. There are no suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is simple arithmetic handling with standard Python functions.",
  "conclusion": "This script performs a basic addition of two input values from the command line without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility with no signs of malicious behavior.",
