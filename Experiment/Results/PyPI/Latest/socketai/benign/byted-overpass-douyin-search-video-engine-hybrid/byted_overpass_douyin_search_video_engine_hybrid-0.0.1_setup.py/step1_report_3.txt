  "purpose": "Define and set up a Python package distribution with metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description, importing 'setuptools' for package setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no output or external data manipulation observed.",
  "flows": "Imports from setuptools -> package setup configuration -> reading README.md -> package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read 'README.md' without error handling; placeholder author information ('Your Name', 'your.email@example.com') which is typical in templates, not malicious. No code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, utilizing 'setuptools'. It reads a long description from a file, specifies package metadata, and configures setup options. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated sections are present. The use of placeholders indicates this might be a template or placeholder package, which is not inherently malicious. No external network activity, data leakage, or security-critical operations are found.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package setup script serving as a placeholder with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
