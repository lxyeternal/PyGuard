  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration, primarily for packaging and distribution purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the long description from the 'README.md' file using open().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; no data leaks or unsafe data handling present.",
  "flows": "Input source: reading 'README.md' file; no flow to untrusted sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The description indicates a placeholder package intended to mitigate dependency confusion risks; no malicious or suspicious code features.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with package metadata. The only dynamic operation is reading 'README.md' content for the long_description. All fields appear standard and legitimate for a package configuration. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package setup script serving as a placeholder to prevent dependency confusion. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
