  "purpose": "Setup script for building a CUDA extension for a Python package, configuring build flags based on environment variables and device capabilities.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., 'TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST', 'GROUPED_GEMM_CUTLASS'), source files ('csrc/ops.cu', 'csrc/grouped_gemm.cu'), and README file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not perform data exfiltration, network activity, or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence build flags; source files are compiled into the extension module.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected; standard build script behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a CUDA extension, importing standard modules, checking for 'torch', configuring build flags based on environment variables and device capabilities, and defining extension modules and package metadata. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. Environment variables are used for configuration, which is standard practice, and no network or data leakage activities are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign build setup for a CUDA extension with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and the minimal security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) reflects standard configuration practices. Overall, the code is safe and aligns with typical usage.",
