  "purpose": "Assessment of minimal import statements from 'grouped_gemm' modules for potential malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'imported grouped_gemm.ops' and 'imported grouped_gemm.backend'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; potential risk if imported modules execute malicious code upon import.",
  "flows": "Import statements potentially trigger module-level code execution, but no further data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected in the code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with no functions or logic. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of such code, noting that malicious activity depends on the content of the imported modules. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero; security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2). Confidence levels are high given the minimal code, but actual risk depends on the trustworthiness of the modules, which cannot be assessed here. No logical flaws or unwarranted claims are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk is minimal, contingent on the integrity of the 'grouped_gemm' modules. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
