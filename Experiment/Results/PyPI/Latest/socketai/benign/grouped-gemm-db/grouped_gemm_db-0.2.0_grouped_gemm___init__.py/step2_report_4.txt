  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports are based solely on import statements: `import grouped_gemm.ops` and `import grouped_gemm.backend`.\n- No additional code, functions, data flows, or behaviors are presented.\n- The majority of reports conclude that these imports are benign, with very low security risk scores (around 0.1-0.2).\n- Malware scores are uniformly 0, indicating no malicious activity detected or suspected based on the provided snippets.\n- Confidence levels are generally high (0.8-0.9), but this is based on minimal context.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validations:\n\n**Are the reported issues present?**  \n- The reports correctly identify that the code only contains import statements. No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious code are visible.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning?**  \n- No. The reasoning that import statements alone are not suspicious is sound.  \n- They acknowledge the limitation: without inspecting the actual modules, malicious activity cannot be confirmed or ruled out.\n\n**Scores review:**  \n- Malware scores are 0, which aligns with the lack of evidence.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reasonable given the minimal code.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n- Confidence levels are high, reflecting the correct assessment based on available information.\n\n**Potential issues with scores?**  \n- No significant issues. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n**Potential for malicious code within modules:**  \n- Importing modules can execute code at import time if the modules contain such code. However, without inspecting the modules, we cannot assign a higher malware score.  \n- The reports correctly note this limitation.\n\n**Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n- The reports avoid making unwarranted claims; they recognize that the snippet alone doesn't indicate malicious activity.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**  \n- The scores are consistent with the minimal code snippet and cautious approach.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**My own estimates for the scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| **0**  | **0**        | **0.1-0.2** |\n\n- **Malware:** 0, since no malicious activity is evident or suspected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** Slightly above 0, perhaps around 0.1, reflecting that importing modules can be risky if the modules are malicious or compromised, but there's no evidence here.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign based solely on import statements.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No further suspicion is warranted without additional context or code.\n- Vigilance should be maintained if the actual modules are from untrusted sources, but this cannot be assessed from the snippet.\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the current evidence indicates low risk, always verify the integrity and source of the 'grouped_gemm' package in real scenarios to prevent supply chain issues.",
