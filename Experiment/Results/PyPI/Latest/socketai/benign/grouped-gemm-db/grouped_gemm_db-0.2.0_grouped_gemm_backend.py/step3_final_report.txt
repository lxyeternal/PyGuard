  "purpose": "Wrapper for a custom C++ backend performing batched matrix multiplication in PyTorch.",
  "sources": "Tensor inputs 'a', 'b', and 'batch_sizes'; import of 'grouped_gemm_backend'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file I/O; no data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are validated, shapes are computed, and data flows from inputs through the backend call to produce output tensor 'c'.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns; missing error handling around backend call noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured wrapper around a trusted external backend for batched GEMM operations. It performs basic assertions for input validation, allocates output tensor if not provided, and calls the backend function. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The only minor concern is the lack of error handling around the backend call, which affects robustness but not security. The external backend's trustworthiness is outside the scope of this snippet. The code does not handle untrusted data insecurely or perform malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It functions as a standard tensor operation wrapper. The low security risk score is appropriate, with the main consideration being the trust in the external backend extension.",
