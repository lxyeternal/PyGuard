  "purpose": "Define and export classes for posting to Discord and handling related errors.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing DiscordPoster and PostToDiscordError from the local module .DiscordPoster",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs; no untrusted data handling or external outputs present",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths, as the code only imports and exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious patterns; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module import and export statement. It imports two components from a local module and specifies the symbols to be exported. There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing logic that could be malicious. The module appears to be part of a larger package, but this snippet alone does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard import and export operation with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is a typical component of a Python package module.",
