  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module import/export pattern.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are identified.\n- The code snippets are minimal, serving primarily as interface definitions or module initializers.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), indicating the reviewers' certainty that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- **Issue presence:** No, the code snippets are benign. They only perform import and export operations with no data processing, network activity, or untrusted data handling.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- **Logical errors:** None. All reports correctly identify the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n- **Reasoning flaws:** No flaws detected; the reasoning is consistent and justified.\n- **Summary accuracy:** Accurate, given the code's minimal and straightforward nature.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Since all evidence points to benign, non-malicious code, **risk scores should remain at 0**.\n- No rationale exists to elevate the risk score, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- The code does not perform any network activity, data handling, or execute any suspicious operations.\n- The malware score of 0 across reports is justified.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- No reports make unwarranted assumptions; all conclusions are based on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n## Final assessment:\nGiven the comprehensive review, **the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.** The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n### My recommended scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard module export pattern with no security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature.",
