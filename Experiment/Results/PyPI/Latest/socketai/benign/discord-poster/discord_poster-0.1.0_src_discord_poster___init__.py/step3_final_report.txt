  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow; import only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement importing classes from a local module and defining __all__ for exports. It contains no data processing, network activity, or external data handling. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code serves as a module initializer or interface, typical in Python packages. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module export pattern with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and require no adjustment.",
