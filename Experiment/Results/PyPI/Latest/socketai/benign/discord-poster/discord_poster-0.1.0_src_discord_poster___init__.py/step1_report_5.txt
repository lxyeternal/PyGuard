{
  "purpose": "Define and export classes for posting messages to Discord, likely for communication or notification purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module '.DiscordPoster', which suggests reading class definitions and possibly constants or exceptions from that module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or code execution within this snippet; the code is purely import and export statements.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes and exports them, with no data flow, input, or output logic present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. The code appears straightforward and typical for a module's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "This code serves as an initializer or export hub for the 'DiscordPoster' class and associated error class. It imports from a local module and exposes these classes via __all__, which is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious activity can be inferred from such simple import/export statements. There are no inputs, outputs, or data handling here that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export pattern with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions to expose classes for external use, with no evidence of obfuscation, malware, or security issues.",
