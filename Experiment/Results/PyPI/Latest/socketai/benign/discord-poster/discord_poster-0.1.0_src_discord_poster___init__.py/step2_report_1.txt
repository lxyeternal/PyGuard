  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code snippets are all identical: simple import statements from a local module and defining `__all__`.\n- No data processing, network activity, or external inputs are involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be a standard module export pattern, likely from an `__init__.py` or similar.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the issues in the code:\n\n**Does the code contain any malicious behavior or security issues?**  \n**Answer:** No. The code is purely import/export declarations with no data flow, no external communication, and no suspicious constructs.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Reviewing the scores:\n\n**Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.  \n**Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.  \n**Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \n**Yes.** Given the simplicity and lack of any suspicious activity, these scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Validity of the reasoning:\n\n- The reports correctly interpret the code as a simple module export pattern.\n- They correctly identify no data flow, no data sinks, no anomalies.\n- No assumptions are made beyond what the code shows.\n\n**Are any claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent based on assumptions?**  \n**No.** The reports are cautious and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- Since the code is minimal and only handles exports, the likelihood of hidden malicious behavior is negligible.\n- The scores could be slightly adjusted if any report overstates the confidence, but they are all high (0.9 to 1), which is acceptable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on all reports and analysis:**\n\n| Score Type     | Recommended Score |\n|----------------|-------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                 |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                 |\n| Security Risk  | 0                 |\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.  \n- The code is a standard pattern for module exports.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is benign.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports?** No significant flaws; all reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n- **Scores assigned?** Appropriate; no changes needed.\n- **Risk justification:** The low scores are justified; no threat exists here.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code snippet is a standard, safe module export pattern with no security concerns. The scores and reasoning across all reports are consistent and accurate.",
