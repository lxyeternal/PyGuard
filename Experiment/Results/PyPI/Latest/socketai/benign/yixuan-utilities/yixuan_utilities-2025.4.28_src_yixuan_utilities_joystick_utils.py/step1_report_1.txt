{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and reads input from a joystick device using the pygame library, and tests joystick input in a loop.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the joystick via pygame.joystick functions.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs joystick data to the console via print statements.",
  "flows": "Joystick input is retrieved through get_axis, get_button, and get_hat methods (sources) and then printed to the console (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward, uses standard pygame functions, and does not handle sensitive data or perform network operations.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes pygame and a joystick device, then continuously reads and prints joystick data until interrupted. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious network activity, or hidden functionalities. The code is typical for a hardware input testing utility, with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign joystick testing utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on local hardware inputs and provides output to the console. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
