  "purpose": "Joystick input testing and reading hardware states using pygame.",
  "sources": "pygame.joystick.get_count(), pygame.joystick.Joystick(0), get_axis(), get_button(), get_hat()",
  "sinks": "Console output via print statements",
  "flows": "Input from joystick hardware (axes, buttons, hats) -> read_joystick() -> print outputs",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward hardware input reading with no suspicious or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code initializes pygame and joystick, reads axes, buttons, and hats, and outputs their states in a loop. It performs no network activity, data exfiltration, or external communication. The code is standard for hardware input testing, with proper error handling if no joystick is found. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign, transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign joystick input tester with no malicious or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
