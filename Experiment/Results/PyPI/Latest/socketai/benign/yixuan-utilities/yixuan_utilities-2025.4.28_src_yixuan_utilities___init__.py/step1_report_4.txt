  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, but without seeing the actual content, the purpose cannot be definitively identified. It may be intended for general computation or a specific task.",
  "sources": "Input sources could include environment variables, user input via functions like input(), or file reads if present. Without explicit code, these are not confirmed.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, system command executions, file writes, or data transmissions if such functions are used. None are explicitly identified without code.",
  "flows": "Source-to-sink flows cannot be determined without concrete code, but typical flows would involve untrusted input leading to unsafe operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observable without code. The code could contain hidden behaviors, but cannot be identified here.",
  "analysis": "Due to absence of actual code content, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. No sources, sinks, or anomalies are identifiable.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the lack of provided code, no malicious behavior or security risks can be confirmed. The code appears benign but cannot be definitively evaluated without content.",
