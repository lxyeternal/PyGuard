  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for RGB-D point cloud processing and visualization with no malicious intent. The only potential security concern is the use of os.system for directory creation, which is benign in current context but should be replaced with safer alternatives if user-controlled input is introduced. Overall, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1."
