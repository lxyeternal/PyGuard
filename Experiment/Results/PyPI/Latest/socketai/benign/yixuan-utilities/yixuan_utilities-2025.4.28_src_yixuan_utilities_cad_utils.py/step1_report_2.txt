  "purpose": "Convert GLB 3D model files to OBJ format using trimesh library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input file paths provided via function arguments and in the main loop constructs file paths based on a pattern.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output files in specified directories; no untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input file paths are generated from a pattern; mesh is loaded from these paths; combined mesh is exported to specified output paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code dynamically constructs file paths but does not involve unsafe code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code loads 3D model files (.glb), combines multiple meshes into one, and exports them as .obj files. The file paths are constructed based on a predictable pattern, and the operations are limited to mesh loading, concatenation, and exporting. No malicious network activity, code injection, or hidden backdoors are present. The code appears to perform a straightforward file conversion task. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a benign file conversion process for 3D models, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be intended for asset processing in a larger project. No suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malware signals are detected.",
