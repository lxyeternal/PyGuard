  "purpose": "Convert GLB 3D model files to OBJ format by loading, concatenating, and exporting meshes.",
  "sources": "File paths provided as function arguments in glb2obj function; specific paths constructed in the main block.",
  "sinks": "File write operations in mesh.export method; exporting OBJ files to specified paths.",
  "flows": "File paths are used as inputs in glb2obj, then the loaded mesh data is processed and exported to output files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or hidden behaviors detected. The code straightforwardly loads and saves 3D model data.",
  "analysis": "The script imports trimesh, defines a function to load a GLB file, concatenate all meshes, and export to OBJ. The main block runs this function for a series of predefined file paths. The code reads model files from specified locations and writes converted files back to disk. No user input, network operations, or suspicious logic is present. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. It appears to be a standard 3D file conversion utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate 3D file conversion task with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply reads, processes, and writes files based on given paths.",
