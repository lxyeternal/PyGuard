{
  "purpose": "Convert GLB 3D model files to OBJ format for each specified battery model.",
  "sources": "Reads GLB files from specified paths in the loop; input paths are constructed dynamically based on loop index.",
  "sinks": "Exports the converted OBJ files to specified output paths; no data leakage or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Reads GLB files, loads meshes, combines them, then exports as OBJ files for each iteration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads 3D model files from specified paths, combines their meshes, and exports the result as OBJ files. It uses the trimesh library for processing. The code is straightforward, performing file I/O operations based on a predictable pattern. No external network communication, no use of sensitive data, and no suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility script for converting 3D models from GLB to OBJ format. There is no indication of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions solely as a file converter with standard library usage.",
