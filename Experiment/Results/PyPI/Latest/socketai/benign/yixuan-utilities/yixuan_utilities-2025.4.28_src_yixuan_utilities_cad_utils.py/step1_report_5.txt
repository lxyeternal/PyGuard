  "purpose": "Convert GLB 3D model files to OBJ format by loading and concatenating meshes.",
  "sources": "Reads GLB files from specified paths, specifically from the file paths constructed in the loop within the main block.",
  "sinks": "Exports the combined mesh to OBJ files at the specified output paths.",
  "flows": "Reads GLB files (source) -> processes meshes -> exports OBJ files (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads GLB files using trimesh, combines all mesh geometries, and exports the result as an OBJ file. The loop processes multiple files in a predictable pattern. There are no signs of malicious actions such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The code performs straightforward 3D file conversions. No external data sources are accessed beyond the specified file paths, which appear to be local. No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a benign task of converting 3D models from GLB to OBJ format. It does not contain malicious code or behaviors, and there are no indications of supply chain attacks. Overall, it appears safe.",
