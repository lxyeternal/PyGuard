  "purpose": "Convert GLB 3D model files to OBJ format by loading and concatenating meshes using the trimesh library.",
  "sources": "Reads GLB files specified by glb_path parameter in the glb2obj function.",
  "sinks": "Exports the combined mesh to an OBJ file specified by obj_path parameter.",
  "flows": "Reads input from specified GLB files, processes meshes, and writes output OBJ files; no untrusted data flows are apparent beyond standard file handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscated code. The loop simply processes multiple files based on predictable paths.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file processing: it loads GLB files, combines their meshes, and exports to OBJ format. It iterates over a range to process multiple specific files. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms are present. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. Usage of the trimesh library is typical for 3D model processing.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward 3D model conversion utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be intended solely for batch converting 3D files within a specified directory structure.",
