  "purpose": "Convert GLB 3D model files to OBJ format by loading, concatenating meshes, and exporting.",
  "sources": "Reading GLB files from specified local paths using trimesh.load.",
  "sinks": "Exporting combined mesh to OBJ files at specified local paths.",
  "flows": "Source: trimesh.load reads GLB files -> Mesh concatenation -> Export to OBJ files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file I/O operations for 3D model conversion. It loads files from predictable paths, combines meshes, and exports them without network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are present. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns indicate benign intent. The security risk is minimal, limited to local file handling, and the malware score is zero. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for 3D model conversion with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It poses negligible security risks, and the supply chain security threat is effectively nonexistent.",
