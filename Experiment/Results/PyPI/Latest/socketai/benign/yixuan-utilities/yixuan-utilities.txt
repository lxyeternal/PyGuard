      "obfuscated": 0.65,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code in report 3 demonstrates suspicious patterns such as obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting a malware score of approximately 0.5 (slightly increased from 0.4). Obfuscation is high but not maximal, so a score of 0.65 is appropriate. The security risk score of 0.6 reflects the potential threat. Other reports are benign or incomplete, with scores aligned to their findings. Overall, the assessment indicates moderate concern primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code patterns, but no confirmed malicious payloads."

No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0. The code's behavior is consistent with a low-risk data serialization utility."

The main security concern is the use of `os.system` for downloading models without validation, which could be exploited if URLs are compromised. However, there is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2."

The only potential security concern is the use of os.system for directory creation, which is benign in current context but should be replaced with safer alternatives if user-controlled input is introduced. Overall, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1."
