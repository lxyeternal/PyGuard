  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate open-source implementation for interactive segmentation and mask tracking. The main security concern is the use of `os.system` for downloading models without validation, which could be exploited if URLs are compromised. However, there is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2."
