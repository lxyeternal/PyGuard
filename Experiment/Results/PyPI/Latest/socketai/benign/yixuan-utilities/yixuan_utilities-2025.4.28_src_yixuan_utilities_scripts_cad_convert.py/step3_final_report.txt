  "purpose": "Load a URDF robot model, extract visual meshes, concatenate and export them as OBJ files, and organize directories for mesh storage.",
  "sources": "URDF file path, link visual geometries, mesh data, link names",
  "sinks": "Mesh export files, directory creation commands",
  "flows": "Extract visual meshes from links -> concatenate meshes -> export meshes -> create directories for each link",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system for directory creation instead of safer Python functions",
  "analysis": "The code loads a robot model, processes visual meshes, concatenates them, and exports as OBJ files. It creates directories using os.system, which is less safe than os.makedirs. No network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The use of link names directly in paths could pose a path traversal risk if manipulated externally, but within controlled data, this is minimal. The code performs standard mesh processing with no malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2 due to the directory creation method. Replacing os.system with os.makedirs and sanitizing link names would improve safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing mesh extraction and export with no malicious behavior. The only minor concern is the use of os.system for directory creation, which can be improved. Overall, it poses no malware threat, and the current scores are appropriate.",
