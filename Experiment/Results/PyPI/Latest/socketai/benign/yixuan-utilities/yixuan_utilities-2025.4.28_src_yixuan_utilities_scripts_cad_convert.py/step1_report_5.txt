  "purpose": "Load and process URDF robot model, extract visual meshes, and save them as OBJ files for further use or visualization.",
  "sources": "Reading file paths (urdf_path), loading URDF file, accessing link.visuals and link.collisions, reading mesh geometry, reading visual origin data.",
  "sinks": "Executing system command to create directories (os.system), writing mesh files to disk, calling mesh.export to save OBJ files.",
  "flows": "URDF file path is read, mesh data is extracted from link.visuals, then mesh.export writes OBJ files to specific directories created via os.system and pathlib.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system for directory creation instead of secure Python APIs; potential reliance on external system commands which could be manipulated if input paths are not controlled (though paths are derived internally). No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns detected; no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a robot description from a URDF file, extracts visual mesh geometries, and exports them as OBJ files. It uses pathlib for path management and trimesh for mesh processing. Directory creation is done via os.system with a command that might be unsafe if input paths are tampered with, but since paths are derived internally and not from user input, this risk is minimal. Mesh export and visualization modifications are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, no code injection, no suspicious data leaks, and no backdoors are detected. Overall, the code performs legitimate file processing tasks related to robot modeling without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical robot model processing script that extracts visual meshes and saves them. It uses standard libraries and methods with a minor security concern regarding the use of os.system for directory creation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or malicious data handling.",
