{
  "purpose": "The code implements an MCP server interface for interacting with Linear's GraphQL API, providing functions to manage issues, teams, projects, and user info, and exposes resources and prompts for external use.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (LINEAR_API_KEY, LINEAR_BASE_URL), user input parameters for API functions, and external API responses via HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to the Linear API endpoint with potentially untrusted data (queries, variables), JSON responses processed and returned, output strings formatted for user display.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (issue IDs, search terms, resource data) flow into GraphQL query payloads, which are sent via HTTP POST; responses are parsed and formatted into strings or JSON data for output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; environment variable usage is standard; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution; no malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves API keys from environment variables, constructs GraphQL requests, and processes responses with error handling. It uses standard libraries (httpx) for network communication and JSON for data formatting. No signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious network activity are evident. The functions are primarily wrappers around API calls with typical input validation. The code does not contain backdoors, hidden functions, or unusual behavior. The only external dependency is 'httpx', which is used appropriately. Overall, the code appears legitimate, intended for API interactions with Linear project management tool, with no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API wrapper server for Linear, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attacks. It securely manages API requests and responses, with no suspicious or malicious patterns observed.",
