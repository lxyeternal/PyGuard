{
  "purpose": "This code acts as an API wrapper and server interface for Linear's GraphQL API, providing tools for issue management, resource listing, user info, and prompts.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for API keys and base URL; function arguments for issue IDs, team IDs, etc.; network requests via httpx to Linear API.",
  "sinks": "API request payloads containing user-supplied data (issue IDs, comments, search terms); response handling; environment variables for credentials.",
  "flows": "User inputs and environment variables flow into API request payloads; network requests are made to Linear API; responses are processed and returned as JSON or strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; no malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client for Linear, utilizing environment variables for credentials, making HTTP requests with proper headers, and handling responses securely. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The functions perform expected CRUD operations and resource listings, with no suspicious data flows or code structures. The environment variable usage and network interactions are standard and pose minimal security risk. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified based on the code's transparency and functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API wrapper for Linear with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or high security risks. The environment variable handling and network requests are standard practices. The assigned scores are accurate and reflect the low likelihood of malicious intent or security issues.",
