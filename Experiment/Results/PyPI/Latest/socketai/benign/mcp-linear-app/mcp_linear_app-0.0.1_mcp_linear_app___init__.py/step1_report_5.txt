{
  "purpose": "A simple server script that connects to the Linear API via MCP protocol, serving as an entry point to run the server.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, and the local server module; uses print for logging; calls server.mcp.run() to start the server.",
  "sinks": "The call to server.mcp.run() potentially invokes external code that may handle untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The script initializes and runs the server via server.mcp.run(), which may involve network communication or data handling within the server module.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports system modules, a local server module, and executes a run method on server.mcp. There are no suspicious data flows or malicious behaviors evident. The only concern depends on the implementation of server.mcp.run(), which is external to this code snippet. The script itself functions as a typical entry point for a server application with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and functions as a simple server starter script. No malicious behavior or suspicious activity is detectable within this snippet.",
