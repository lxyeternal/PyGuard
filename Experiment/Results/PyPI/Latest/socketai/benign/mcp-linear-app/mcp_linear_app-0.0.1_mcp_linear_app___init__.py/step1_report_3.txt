{
  "purpose": "To initialize and run a server that connects to the Linear API via MCP protocol.",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments from sys.argv (implicitly), importing local module 'server', executing server.mcp.run()",
  "sinks": "Execution of server.mcp.run() (potentially invoking external or network operations within the server module)",
  "flows": "Main function called at script execution, which calls server.mcp.run(), potentially triggering network or API interactions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected; reliance on external 'server' module without inspecting its internals",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal script that imports a local server module, defines a main function to start the server, and runs this function if executed as a script. There are no apparent malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors within this snippet. The core operation depends on the implementation of 'server.mcp.run()'. Since this is not provided, the security assessment is limited to this file. The code appears straightforward and intended for legitimate server operation, with no suspicious or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is simple and functions as an entry point to start a server process. Without further details of the 'server' module, the risk remains low.",
