  "purpose": "A simple script to start a Linear MCP server that connects to the Linear API via MCP.",
  "sources": "The script reads the `sys` module and imports `server` from the same package.",
  "sinks": "The script calls `server.mcp.run()`, which could potentially execute code within the server module, but without further detail, it is considered a sink where the server's run method is invoked.",
  "flows": "The script flows from script execution to calling the main() function, which in turn calls `server.mcp.run()`, initiating server operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is straightforward and typical for a server entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a local server module. It defines a main() function that prints a startup message and invokes `server.mcp.run()`. There is no evidence of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The invocation of `server.mcp.run()` depends entirely on the server module's implementation, which is not provided, but based on this code alone, there is no indication of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard entry point for starting a server and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. The security of the overall system depends on the implementation of `server.mcp.run()`, which is not available here.",
