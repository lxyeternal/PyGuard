{
  "purpose": "A minimal script serving as an entry point to start the Linear MCP server via server.mcp.run().",
  "sources": "The script reads no external input; it imports the local 'server' module and calls server.mcp.run().",
  "sinks": "The external server.mcp.run() function is a sink where untrusted code could execute, potentially leading to malicious behavior depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "The script flows from startup (printing a message) directly to executing server.mcp.run(), which may perform network operations or other actions depending on its code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present in this snippet; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple launcher that outputs a startup message and invokes an external server module. Its security implications depend entirely on the implementation of server.mcp.run(), which is not provided. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or embedded secrets within this snippet. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the minimal and benign nature of the code, though the risk score could be slightly lowered to 0.1 to reflect the low inherent risk of a straightforward launcher. Overall, the code appears benign, and the security posture hinges on the external module's trustworthiness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign entry point script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. Its security implications depend on the external server.mcp.run() implementation. Based on this snippet alone, there is no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
