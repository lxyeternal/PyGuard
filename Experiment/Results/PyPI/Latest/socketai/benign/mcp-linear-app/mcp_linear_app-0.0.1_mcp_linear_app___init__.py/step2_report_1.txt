  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a minimal entry point that prints a startup message and calls `server.mcp.run()`.\n- No input validation, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- The actual behavior depends on the implementation of `server.mcp.run()`, which is external and not provided.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  Based solely on this code snippet, **no issues are present**. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a simple launcher, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.\n- They appropriately note that the real security implications depend on `server.mcp.run()`, which is outside this snippet.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. This is correct; there's no evidence of malicious code here.\n  \n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All assign `0`, which is accurate; no obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign a low risk (~0.2). Given the minimal code and lack of suspicious patterns, this seems reasonable. However, since the actual server behavior is unknown, some might argue for a slightly higher score if `server.mcp.run()` could be malicious, but based on this snippet alone, 0.2 is acceptable.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- No issues justify a higher risk score. The code is a straightforward entry point, with no embedded secrets or suspicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- The main concern is **dependence on external code** (`server.mcp.run()`), which could be malicious if implemented poorly. But from this snippet alone, no evidence supports that.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessments and scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** Keep at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Keep at 0.2 or possibly lower, considering the code's simplicity and benign appearance.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (due to dependency on external code)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, functioning as a launcher for a server process. The security posture hinges on the implementation of `server.mcp.run()`, which cannot be assessed here. No malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are evident in this snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. No changes needed to their scores or conclusions based on this snippet.",
