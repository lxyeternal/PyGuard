{
  "purpose": "This script serves as an entry point for starting a Linear MCP server that connects to the Linear API through MCP protocol.",
  "sources": "Reads system input/output and imports a local 'server' module, specifically invoking server.mcp.run()",
  "sinks": "Calls server.mcp.run() which may execute further code; no direct untrusted data sinks are visible in this snippet",
  "flows": "The main function initiates the server.mcp.run() process, which is the primary flow, but details of internal flows are abstracted away",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, unusual code patterns, or suspicious behaviors are present",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing a local server module and starting a server process. No malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious activities are evident. The critical operation depends on server.mcp.run(), which is external to this snippet; thus, its security cannot be assessed here. The script is minimal, serving solely as a launcher without embedded secrets or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, functioning as a simple server starter. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment. However, the security posture heavily depends on the implementation of server.mcp.run() and the server module.",
