{
  "purpose": "Initialize and run the Linear MCP server, which connects to the Linear API via MCP protocol.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly; it imports a module named 'server' and accesses its 'mcp.run()' method.",
  "sinks": "The 'server.mcp.run()' call may execute network operations, but specifics are not provided in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The main flow involves starting the program, printing a message, and then executing 'server.mcp.run()'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns are present. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal script that sets up a server by calling 'server.mcp.run()'. No data input handling, no sensitive data processing, and no suspicious operations are visible. It depends on external 'server' module, but without further details, there's no indication of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, primarily serving as a launcher for a server component. No malicious activity, security risks, or suspicious anomalies are detected within this fragment.",
