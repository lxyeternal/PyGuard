{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an SDK for AI data processing, providing modules for data ingestion, validation, metadata management, embedding, PII detection, vector database interaction, and feedback collection.",
  "sources": "The code imports internal modules (.ingestion, .quality, .metadata, .embedding, .pii, .vector_db, .feedback) and specific classes from these modules.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct data sinks or output channels that handle untrusted data; it only imports modules and defines a version.",
  "flows": "No data flows are explicitly present within this code snippet; the main flow involves usage of imported modules in the user's application, which is not part of this code.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be standard module import and initialization code typical for an SDK.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an SDK interface with modular imports and class definitions for various data processing functionalities. No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious patterns are present. It solely organizes and exposes components for external use. The only notable aspect is the structured modular approach, which is common and expected in SDK design. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SDK setup with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports and re-exports modules and classes for external use, with no embedded data handling or suspicious activities.",
