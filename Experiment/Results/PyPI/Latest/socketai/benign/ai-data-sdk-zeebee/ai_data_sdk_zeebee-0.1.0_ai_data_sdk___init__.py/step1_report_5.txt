  "purpose": "Provides a high-level SDK for AI data processing, including data ingestion, validation, metadata management, embedding, PII detection, vector database interaction, and feedback collection.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the current package and specific classes/functions for simplified access",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present in the provided code snippet",
  "flows": "Not explicitly detailed in this snippet; primarily module imports and API structure",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code structure appears standard and well-organized, with no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a package initialization script, importing modules and exposing classes for external use. No data processing, external data input, or potentially dangerous operations occur here. The module imports are typical for Python SDKs and do not indicate malicious behavior. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic. The overall design aligns with standard package structure, focusing on modularization and usability.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward SDK initialization file, importing various modules and classes for use in AI data processing tasks. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks within this code snippet. It appears safe and standard.",
