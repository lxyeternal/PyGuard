  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence provided, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward SDK initializer, importing modules and exposing classes.\n- It contains no executable logic, data handling, or network operations.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The example usage is purely illustrative, not functional code.\n- The overall structure aligns with typical Python SDK packages.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard SDK for AI data processing.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, standard SDK setup.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious patterns, just module imports.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent, no concerns.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** SDK for data processing.\n- **Analysis:** No executable logic, no external data handling shown, no secrets.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1), possibly reflecting the general risk of SDKs if misused, but no specific vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 1.0.\n\n**Justification:** The minimal security risk score seems to be a default or conservative estimate, but no actual risk is present in the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Similar SDK setup.\n- **Analysis:** No data processing, no external calls, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** SDK initialization.\n- **Analysis:** Standard import statements, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1, which is acceptable given the minimal inherent risk of SDK code that doesn't process data directly.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The **security risk score of 0.1** in report 3 is slightly above zero but justified as a conservative estimate; however, since no actual risk is evident, it could be adjusted to 0 for consistency.\n- The **malware score** remains at 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks identified)\n\nThe current scores are reasonable and aligned with the evidence.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent with the code's benign nature.
