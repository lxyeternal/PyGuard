  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward SDK setup with module imports, version declaration, and example usage comments.\n- No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The code does not process untrusted data directly within this snippet; it primarily organizes and exposes modules.\n- The malware scores are all zero, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are mostly zero, with one report assigning 0.1, which seems slightly overcautious given the code's nature.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: it's an SDK initializer with module imports and version info.\n- No actual data processing, network calls, or external data handling are present in this snippet.\n- The example usage demonstrates typical data flow but does not execute within this code snippet.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0, with one at 0.1. Given the code's benign nature, a score of 0 is appropriate; 0.1 might be slightly overestimating risk.\n\n**Potential improvements:**\n- The securityRisk score of 0.1 in report 3 could be reduced to 0, aligning with the rest and the code's nature.\n- All other scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate, with minor adjustment for the one slightly elevated securityRisk score.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- malware: **0** (no malicious activity)\n- obfuscated: **0** (no obfuscation)\n- risk: **0** (no security risk detected)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a standard, safe SDK initializer with no malicious signals or vulnerabilities. The scores should reflect this benign assessment.",
