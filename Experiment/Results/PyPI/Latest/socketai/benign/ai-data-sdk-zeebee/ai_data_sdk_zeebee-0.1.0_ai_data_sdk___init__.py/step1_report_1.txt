{
  "purpose": "Provides a Python SDK for data processing, embedding, validation, and storage for AI applications.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and loads data from a JSON file in example usage.",
  "targets": "No explicit data sinks; the example shows data being stored in a vector database via vector_db.store_vectors(embeddings).",
  "flows": "Data is ingested from JSON -> embeddings are created -> stored in vector database.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and mainly imports modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK setup with module imports, version declaration, and an example usage comment block. No external or untrusted data flows are apparent beyond typical SDK function calls. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present. The structure indicates normal SDK functionality without malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SDK setup with clear structure, no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines an SDK with various modules for AI data processing. No malicious signals detected.",
