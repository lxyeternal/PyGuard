  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of findings from reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward SDK setup, mainly consisting of module imports, version declaration, and example usage comments.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code does not process untrusted data directly within this snippet; data flows are part of external modules or user applications.\n- The malware scores assigned are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- The security risk scores are low, mostly 0 or 0.1, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating the reviewers are certain about the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity?**  \n  No. The code is purely structural, defining an SDK interface with no embedded logic that could be malicious.\n\n- **Obfuscation or suspicious patterns?**  \n  No. All reports agree on the code's clarity and standard structure.\n\n- **Hardcoded secrets or credentials?**  \n  Not present. No such patterns are evident.\n\n- **External or untrusted data handling?**  \n  Not within this code snippet. Data flows are in external modules or user code.\n\n- **Supply chain attack vectors?**  \n  None apparent here; the code is a typical package initializer.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  The highest is 0.1, which is reasonable given the code's minimal surface area and lack of risky patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed based on the current evidence.\n- The overall assessment should remain that this code is benign, with no signs of malware or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Estimate:\n\nConsidering all reports and the code content:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but 0.1 is acceptable given the minimal structure)\n\n**This code is a standard SDK initializer with no malicious or risky elements.**",
