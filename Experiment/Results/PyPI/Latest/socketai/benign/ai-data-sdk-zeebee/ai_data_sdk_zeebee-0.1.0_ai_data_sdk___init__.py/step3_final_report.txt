  "purpose": "SDK initialization and module import setup for AI data processing",
  "sources": "Module import statements, version declaration, example usage comments",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external network calls, or data leaks present",
  "flows": "Import statements and class definitions; no data flow or external data processing within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK setup file with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. It imports modules, declares a version, and provides example usage comments. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of this code. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in one report is a conservative estimate but does not reflect actual vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign SDK initializer with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores across reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
