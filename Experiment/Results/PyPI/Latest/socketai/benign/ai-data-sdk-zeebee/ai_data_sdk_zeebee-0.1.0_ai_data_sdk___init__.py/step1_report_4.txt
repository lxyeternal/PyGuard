{
  "purpose": "Provides a SDK for standardizing, processing, embedding, and retrieving AI data, including modules for ingestion, quality checks, metadata, embedding, PII detection, vector database, and feedback.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules and submodules, especially the initial import of external modules and the JSON data file in example usage.",
  "sinks": "Potential data ingestion and storage functions such as ingestion.load_from_json(), embedding.create_embeddings(), vector_db.store_vectors() - these are typical data flow points, but no direct untrusted data handling shown within this code.",
  "flows": "Data loaded from JSON -> processed by embedding creation -> stored in vector database; however, this is only an example usage, not actual code execution within the script.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code; standard SDK module structure with no malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of module imports, version declaration, and example usage comments. There are no data processing or logic implementations shown that could contain malicious behavior. The import of submodules and classes is typical for a Python SDK. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious functions are present. The code structure appears normal for an SDK intended for AI data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard SDK setup with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It primarily declares modules and provides an example of usage. There are no suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious functionalities identified.",
