  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code provided and the logical conclusions drawn.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward SDK initialization file: it imports modules, declares a version, and provides an example usage comment block.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or network calls are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n  The code does not contain any issues such as malicious code, backdoors, or vulnerabilities. It’s a standard SDK setup.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n  The reports are consistent and logical. They correctly interpret the code as a benign SDK initializer with no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores mostly at 0 or 0.1, which seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n1. **Malware score justification:**  \n   Since there is no evidence of malicious code, malware scores of 0 are appropriate. The code does not perform any external data handling, network activity, or code execution beyond module imports.\n\n2. **Obfuscated code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify the code as not obfuscated (score 0). The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n3. **Risk scores:**  \n   The overall security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1). Given the absence of vulnerabilities, this is justified.\n\n4. **Potential assumptions or claims:**  \n   The reports do not rely on unfounded assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as a benign package initializer.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Adjustments to scores:**  \n  The current scores seem appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n- **Overall estimate:**  \n  Based on all reports and the code, I would assign the following scores:\n  \n  - **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n  - **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nThe code is a standard, benign SDK setup with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric            | Estimated Score |\n|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware           | 0               |\n| Obfuscated        | 0               |\n| Risk              | 0               |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain report correctly identifies the code as safe, with no malicious or obfuscated components, and a negligible security risk.",
