{
  "purpose": "Provides an SDK for data processing, embedding, and retrieval in AI applications",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the current package and specific classes for simplified access",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; code mainly handles module imports and class definitions",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code does not process external input directly",
  "anomalies": "Contains only import statements and module metadata; no executable logic, data handling, or external connections",
  "analysis": "The code defines an SDK with multiple modules for AI data processing, providing import statements and version info. It does not include any functions, data handling, or network activity. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious patterns are present. The lack of executable code or data processing reduces risk. The code appears to be a standard package initializer without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign package initialization file with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks.",
