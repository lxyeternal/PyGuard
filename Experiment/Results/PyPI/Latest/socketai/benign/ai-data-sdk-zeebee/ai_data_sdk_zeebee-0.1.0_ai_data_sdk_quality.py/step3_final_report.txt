{
  "purpose": "Provides data validation tools, including schema validation, structure checks, and custom validation functions, to ensure data quality and standards.",
  "sources": "Reads input data for validation, schema creation, and error handling within validation functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission or system modification; errors are logged or exceptions raised locally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input through validation functions, with errors or exceptions indicating validation failures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code; uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data validation tasks, including schema validation, structure checks, length validation, and filtering. It uses well-known libraries like jsonschema, with no obfuscated or suspicious code. No network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no backdoors are present. The validation functions operate locally, and error handling is straightforward. The code's benign nature is consistent with its purpose, and no malicious behavior or sabotage is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data validation module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. It adheres to best practices and does not perform any suspicious or harmful actions.",
