{
  "purpose": "This module provides data validation tools for ensuring data quality and standards, including schema validation, structure checks, and custom validation functions.",
  "sources": "Data input from validation functions, external data passed to methods like validate_with_schema, validate_with_function, validate_structure, validate_text_length, validate_and_filter, validate_and_raise, and the helper functions creating schemas.",
  "sinks": "Validation functions process untrusted data, potentially leading to validation errors or exceptions. No data leaks or sensitive data handling observed. No network or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input data is received via validation methods, processed through schema validation, custom validation functions, or structural checks. Errors are returned or exceptions raised. No external data is fetched or sent.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated variables, or misleading variable names. Logging setup is standard. No signs of data exfiltration, network communication, or reverse shells. All validation is standard, with no suspicious side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly performs data validation tasks: schema validation, structural validation, length checks, and filtering. All operations are contained, with no external data transmission, no code injection, and no system modifications. Exception handling is appropriate, and validation errors are logged or raised as exceptions. Helper functions generate schemas securely. No malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data validation module with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It performs standard validation tasks with no external side effects or security risks.",
