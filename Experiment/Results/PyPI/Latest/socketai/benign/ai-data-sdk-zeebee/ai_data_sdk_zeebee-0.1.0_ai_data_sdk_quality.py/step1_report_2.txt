{
  "purpose": "The code provides tools for validating data quality, enforcing data standards, and creating JSON schemas for documents and embeddings.",
  "sources": "Input data passed to validation functions (validate_with_schema, validate_with_function, validate_structure, validate_text_length, validate_and_filter, validate_and_raise), as well as JSON schemas created and used within these functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data inputs processed by validation functions, which could be used to inject malicious schema or data for exploits; exceptions raised during validation could be exploited if improperly handled, but no direct data leakage or malicious system access is observed.",
  "flows": "Data is read from input parameters in validation functions -> validated against schemas or validation functions -> errors or filtered data returned; no direct malicious data flow observed beyond standard validation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden data exfiltration routines, are present. The code uses standard validation libraries and practices. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are detected. No network or file system operations are performed.",
  "analysis": "The module primarily performs data validation, schema creation, and filtering. It employs well-known libraries like jsonschema for validation, with no code that reads or writes files, connects to networks, or executes system commands. All validation functions are standard and do not contain malicious logic. There are no hidden data exfiltration or backdoors; the code focuses solely on data validation routines. The use of exception handling and logging is appropriate, and no suspicious behavior or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data validation utility with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It relies on standard libraries and follows common validation patterns without any hidden or malicious code. Overall, it presents a low security risk and no malware indicators.",
