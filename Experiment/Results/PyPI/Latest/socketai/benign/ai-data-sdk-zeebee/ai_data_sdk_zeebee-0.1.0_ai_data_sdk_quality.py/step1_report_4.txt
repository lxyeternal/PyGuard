{
  "purpose": "This module provides data validation tools for ensuring data quality and standards, including schema validation, custom validation functions, and filtering mechanisms.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from parameters in validation functions (e.g., validate_with_schema, validate_with_function, validate_structure, validate_text_length, validate_and_filter, validate_and_raise), as well as JSON schemas and data inputs for validation.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include validation functions that could be misused to validate malicious data, but no direct data leaks, network activity, or file manipulations are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into validation methods; schema validation and custom validation functions check data integrity; errors are collected or exceptions raised, but no dangerous data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for a data validation module. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, or backdoors. No obfuscated code features or unusual constructs are present. Logging is only used for warnings and errors related to validation, not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data validation class with methods for schema validation, custom validation, structure checks, text length checks, and filtering. Helper functions create JSON schemas for common data types. Validation errors are logged or raised, but no external data transmission, code injection, or system manipulation is evident. All validation logic is contained within safe, standard Python practices, and there are no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The module is a standard, well-structured data validation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It performs typical validation tasks without executing or transmitting untrusted data externally. No anomalies or malicious code detected.",
