{
  "purpose": "The code provides tools for data validation, schema generation, and dataset analysis, focusing on ensuring data quality and consistency.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries (logging, re, json, statistics, datetime, typing, jsonschema) and internal modules (.validation). It reads input data through method parameters, such as documents and schemas.",
  "sinks": "Uses validation functions and data processing logic internally; no direct untrusted data sinks like network or file I/O. No suspicious data leaks or external data exfiltration points detected.",
  "flows": "Input data (documents, schemas) flow into validation, schema generation, and analysis functions. Data is processed for quality metrics, statistics, and schema inference without external network or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden code present. The code performs standard data validation, statistical analysis, and schema generation. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior observed. The functions are well-structured and do not include hidden or misleading code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of classes and functions for data validation (DataQualityValidator), dataset analysis (DatasetAnalyzer), and schema generation. It utilizes common libraries such as jsonschema for validation and statistics for analysis. The code performs checks for schema conformity, data quality issues, outlier detection, and correlation analysis. It does not include any network operations, system modifications, or hidden behaviors. All logic appears transparent, designed solely for data integrity purposes. No signs of malware or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive data validation and analysis toolkit with no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It does not perform any external communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The design and implementation are consistent with legitimate data quality engineering tools.",
