  "purpose": "The code provides tools for data validation, quality assessment, schema generation, and dataset analysis to ensure data integrity and consistency.",
  "sources": "User-provided data in validate_document, validate_dataset, analyze_dataset, generate_schema functions and class initializations.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of validation or analysis logic based on data inputs; no explicit data leaks or network operations observed.",
  "flows": "Data from input functions flows into validation, analysis, and schema generation methods which process and analyze the data without executing external commands or code injection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. Usage of standard libraries and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. No suspicious network or system calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive implementation of data validation and analysis routines using standard Python libraries and jsonschema. It performs schema validation, quality checks, statistical analysis, and schema generation based on dataset contents. The structure is typical for data validation tools and contains no indicators of malicious behavior. The functions operate solely on provided data, with no network or system modifications, no eval/exec calls, and no hidden behaviors. The presence of helper functions for usage convenience does not introduce security issues. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate data processing utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data validation and analysis module with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It operates solely on input data with no external communication or harmful system modifications. The overall security risk is very low.",
