{
  "purpose": "This module manages configuration for the AI Data SDK, supporting environment variables, configuration files, and validation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (OPENAI_API_KEY, DATABASE_URL, LOG_LEVEL, API_HOST, API_PORT, DEBUG), configuration file (JSON), default configuration values.",
  "sinks": "None directly, as the code does not perform data output to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are loaded into internal attributes and config dictionary, with validation checks; configuration file content is merged into defaults; validation and logging setup occur after loading.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets aside from environment variables, which are standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic. The only potential concern is reliance on environment variables for sensitive data, but this is typical and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration management: loading defaults, optionally from a JSON file, then overriding with environment variables. It includes validation for certain fields, and logs warnings if issues arise. No suspicious behaviors such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. No hardcoded credentials aside from environment variable references. The structure and logic are straightforward. No malicious or sabotage code detected. The code handles sensitive info like API keys through environment variables, which is a best practice. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for secure configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign configuration management module with no malicious intent. It handles environment variables and configuration files securely without exposing secrets directly. No malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks detected.",
