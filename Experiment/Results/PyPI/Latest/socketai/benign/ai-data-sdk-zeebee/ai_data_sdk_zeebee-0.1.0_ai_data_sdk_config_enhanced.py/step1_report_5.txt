{
  "purpose": "Provides a configurable setup for an AI Data SDK with environment variable and file-based configuration, including validation and logging.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (OPENAI_API_KEY, DATABASE_URL, LOG_LEVEL, API_HOST, API_PORT, DEBUG), optional configuration file, internal default configuration.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; configuration values are used internally for setup and do not directly lead to external data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are loaded into internal state, configuration files are loaded and merged, then validated; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks with malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials aside from OPENAI_API_KEY which is environment-based, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution or misleading variables. The code's structure is standard for configuration management.",
  "analysis": "The code manages configuration securely by relying on environment variables and configuration files, with validation and logging. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. It handles secrets appropriately and does not perform external network actions or data exfiltration. The only sensitive data is the API key, which is sourced from environment variables. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured configuration management module without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code, and the security risk score is minimal.",
