{
  "purpose": "This code provides a configuration management system for the AI Data SDK, supporting environment variables, configuration files, and validation to ensure proper setup.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY, DATABASE_URL, LOG_LEVEL, API_HOST, API_PORT, DEBUG), configuration files (JSON), and internal default settings.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network activity, or malicious data flows are present; secrets are stored in environment variables, avoiding hardcoding.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from environment variables and files into internal config structures, with validation and logging setup; no external or malicious sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. Proper handling of secrets via environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured configuration module that loads defaults, optionally merges from a JSON file, overrides with environment variables, and performs validation. It handles secrets securely via environment variables, performs validation on models and metrics, and sets up logging accordingly. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external network activity are present. The code adheres to best practices for configuration management, with no suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, secure configuration management module with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
