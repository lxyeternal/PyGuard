{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions to interface with vector databases, including in-memory storage and a disabled FAISS implementation, for storing, searching, and deleting embedding vectors with associated metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from documents (via add_documents), vectors (via store_vectors), and query vectors (via search). It also reads files when saving and loading FAISS indexes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes index files when saving/loading FAISS indices, and outputs logs. No direct data leaks or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from documents to stored vectors, then from search queries to results, with optional filtering. Index files are saved and loaded from disk, but these are standard operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The FAISS import is commented out with an explicit warning, indicating disabled support. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variables present.",
  "analysis": "The module primarily defines classes for vector storage: in-memory and FAISS-based. The FAISS code is disabled and only logs a warning, avoiding actual index creation. Both storage methods include standard vector similarity operations and management of associated metadata. The code handles data addition, search, and deletion securely within the scope of its functionality. No network operations, cryptic code, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The file operations for saving/loading indices are typical and do not suggest malicious intent. All data handling appears to be standard for a vector database interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of vector database interfaces, with disabled FAISS support and no signs of malicious behavior. It focuses on data storage, retrieval, and management, with no indications of sabotage, backdoors, or privacy violations.",
