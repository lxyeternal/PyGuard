{
  "purpose": "This module provides classes and functions for storing, searching, and managing vector embeddings in various vector database implementations, mainly for similarity search tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from document dictionaries (extracting embedding vectors and metadata), user-provided query vectors, and file I/O operations for saving/loading indexes.",
  "sinks": "Data can be written to index files (via faiss.write_index and json dump), and metadata is stored in files. No network or system data is transmitted or leaked.",
  "flows": "Input vectors and metadata from documents flow into store_vectors methods; search results, which include metadata, are returned; file operations read/write index and metadata files; delete methods modify internal data structures.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a commented-out import of 'faiss' with a warning about disabling FAISS support, but the actual FAISS index methods are still present. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are detected. The code manages in-memory data and index files normally, with no hidden network or external data exfiltration code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for vector storage and search, with an emphasis on in-memory and FAISS-based implementations. FAISS support is disabled via warning, but the related code remains. No network calls, cryptic obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. Data flows are straightforward, and no code injects or executes untrusted input beyond normal data handling. File operations are used for persistence, with standard JSON and faiss API usage. The code appears to be a typical vector search utility module, with no signs of malicious or sabotage intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of vector database handling for similarity search. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. FAISS support is temporarily disabled, but the relevant code remains intact. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose security risks.",
