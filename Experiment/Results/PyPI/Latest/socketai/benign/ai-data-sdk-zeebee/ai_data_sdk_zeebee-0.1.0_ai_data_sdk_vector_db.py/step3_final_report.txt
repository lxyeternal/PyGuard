{
  "purpose": "Provides vector database interfaces supporting in-memory and FAISS (disabled) implementations for storing, searching, and deleting vectors with associated metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads input vectors, metadata, and configuration files; writes index and metadata files to disk.",
  "sinks": "Stores index and metadata files; no external network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input documents to vector storage; index save/load involves file I/O; no external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors; FAISS support is explicitly disabled with comments and warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard vector storage and retrieval functions with clear structure and comments. FAISS support is commented out and replaced with in-memory fallback, indicating compatibility handling rather than malicious intent. No external network calls, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The presence of disabled FAISS code does not constitute malicious behavior but could be a potential modification point. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard vector database utility with disabled FAISS support. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are detected. The minimal security risk stems from the potential to re-enable or modify the FAISS component, but as-is, it is safe.",
