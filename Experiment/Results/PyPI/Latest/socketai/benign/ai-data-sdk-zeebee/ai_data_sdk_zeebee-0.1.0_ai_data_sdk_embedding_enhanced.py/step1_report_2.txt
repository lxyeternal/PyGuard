{
  "purpose": "The code provides an advanced utility for generating text embeddings using various models and providers, supporting features like batching, normalization, and text chunking.",
  "sources": "Input texts for embedding, environment variables for API keys, configuration parameters for models and provider selection.",
  "sinks": "Generated embeddings returned as lists of floats, potentially stored or transmitted; API key usage relies on environment variables; no direct data leaks or malicious data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input texts are validated, passed to provider-specific embedding functions, optionally normalized, and returned. Text chunks are split, embedded, and augmented with embeddings. API keys are read from environment or provided directly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No suspicious or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, or unusual code structures. API key handling is standard. Use of standard libraries (numpy, openai). No indications of malicious behavior or privacy violations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, feature-rich embedding utility that uses standard APIs and libraries for processing. It handles batching, normalization, and chunking appropriately. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The only potential concern could be API key management, but it defaults to environment variables, which is standard practice. No code injection, unsafe SQL, or malicious side effects are present. The logic and structure follow best practices for a benign utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented embedding utility without any malicious intent or behavior. It relies on standard APIs and does not contain suspicious or malicious code segments. No malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are detected.",
