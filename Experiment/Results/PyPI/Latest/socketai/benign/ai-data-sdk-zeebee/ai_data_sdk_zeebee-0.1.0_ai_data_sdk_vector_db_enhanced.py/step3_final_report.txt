{
  "purpose": "This module provides an enhanced vector database with support for storing vectors, filtering, hybrid search, and persistence through save/load functions.",
  "sources": "Input vectors and metadata during storage and addition; file I/O during save_index and load_index functions.",
  "sinks": "File writing in save_index; file reading in load_index; no network activity or external data transfer.",
  "flows": "Vectors and metadata are stored in memory; text index built from metadata; search functions compute similarities and filter results; index saved to or loaded from disk.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected; standard library usage and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard vector database with hybrid search capabilities, including text indexing, filtering, and persistence. No signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation are present. Data flows are typical for such systems, with in-memory storage and file-based persistence. No external network calls or code injection points are evident. The security considerations mainly involve data exposure via saved files, which is common and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured vector database module with hybrid search features. It does not contain malware or sabotage signals. The potential security risk is limited to data exposure through file storage, which is standard for such systems. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and legitimacy.",
