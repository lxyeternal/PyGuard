{
  "purpose": "Provides tools for collecting user feedback and detecting embedding drift, primarily for model monitoring and feedback collection.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function arguments, uses environment data (like datetime), and external libraries (numpy, logging).",
  "sinks": "Stores feedback data in memory, performs statistical calculations, and logs debug messages. No data is transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Input data (feedback, embeddings) is stored and processed locally; no external network transmission or untrusted data execution is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Contains helper functions that instantiate new FeedbackCollector objects each time they are called, which could lead to inconsistent state management but not malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for feedback collection and drift detection, with methods for adding feedback, generating statistics, registering embedding snapshots, and detecting drift. It relies on numpy for statistical analysis and logging for debugging. Helper functions create new instances of the class for single operations, which is inefficient but not malicious. There are no external network calls, credential handling, or code obfuscation. The operations are straightforward and typical for model monitoring tools. No suspicious behavior or malware signatures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a feedback collection and drift detection module with no malicious intent. It does not contain any backdoors, external data exfiltration, or harmful behaviors. The primary concern might be inefficient object instantiation via helpers, but this is not malicious. Overall, the code seems safe and benign.",
