  "purpose": "Provides tools for collecting user feedback and detecting embedding drift in models.",
  "sources": "In-memory data structures, standard library functions (logging, datetime, numpy), helper functions instantiating new class objects.",
  "sinks": "In-memory storage, logging outputs, no external network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "add_user_feedback and register_embedding_snapshot methods store data internally; detect_drift compares current embeddings with stored snapshots.",
  "anomalies": "Helper functions instantiate new FeedbackCollector objects each call, which is inefficient but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate feedback collection and drift detection functions using standard libraries. No external communication, no obfuscated code, no malicious routines detected. Helper functions' repeated instantiation is inefficient but benign. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for feedback and drift detection with no signs of malware or malicious obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and align with the analysis.",
