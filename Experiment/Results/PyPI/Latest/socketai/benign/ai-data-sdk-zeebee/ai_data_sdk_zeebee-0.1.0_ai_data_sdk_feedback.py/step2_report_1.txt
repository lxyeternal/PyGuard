  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The review states no suspicious or malicious activity, no obfuscation, and standard use of libraries. The code is straightforward, with in-memory storage, no external communication, and no backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low risk)\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. The low security risk score seems reasonable given the in-memory data handling and lack of external access.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with no external network calls, no malicious code, and standard data processing. Helper functions instantiate new class objects each time, which is inefficient but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1–0.2 (low)\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score is justified. No malicious intent or obfuscation detected.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous assessments. No suspicious behaviors, external communication, or obfuscation. Helper functions instantiate new objects, which is inefficient but benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) is acceptable, considering minor inefficiency but no malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above, with no external network activity, no malicious code, and standard practices. Helper functions are inefficient but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data exfiltration. The code is straightforward, with in-memory storage and standard libraries.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score matches the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (score=0).\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation (score=0).\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), but all are low and justified given the code's benign nature.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** ~0.1–0.2 (low risk, mainly due to inefficiency in helper functions, not malicious intent)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' assessments are consistent with the code analysis. No adjustments are necessary. The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of feedback collection and drift detection with no signs of malware or malicious obfuscation.",
