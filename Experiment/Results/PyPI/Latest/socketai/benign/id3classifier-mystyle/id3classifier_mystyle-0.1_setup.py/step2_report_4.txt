  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is a standard, benign setup.py script with no malicious behavior.\n- The code reads from 'README.md' using open(), which is common practice.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, network activity, or data leaks are identified.\n- The package metadata contains placeholder values, but these are not security issues per se.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or vulnerabilities based on the provided code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code in all reports matches the original code snippet.\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n- The dependency list and setup parameters are typical.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in reasoning:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n\nThese scores are consistent with the analysis and the code content.\n\n### Risk justification:\n- Since the code performs only static configuration without dynamic or external code execution, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The 'malware' score of 0 is justified; there's no malicious activity.\n- The 'obfuscated' score of 0 is justified; code is straightforward.\n- The overall security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nAll reports are consistent with this assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, benign setup.py script for packaging a Python project. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors are present. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence provided.",
