  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no active malware or malicious intent. The main concern is the typo-squatting package name and the use of UI prompts, which could be exploited socially. The current scores are appropriate; a slight increase in security risk score to around 0.3 would better reflect the potential deception without indicating active threat."
