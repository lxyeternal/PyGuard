{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes from local modules for handling vector data and reranking, likely for information retrieval or machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No output or untrusted data handling is present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurs within this snippet; it's only import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident. The code structure is straightforward and typical for module imports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, indicating dependencies on 'contextual_pgvector' and 'reranker'. These imports suggest usage of vector-based retrieval or ranking mechanisms. No suspicious or malicious behavior can be inferred solely from these import statements. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated logic. The code appears standard for a Python project involving vector similarity or ranking functions.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this code snippet alone, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The imports are typical for machine learning or information retrieval workflows, with no signs of malware or security concerns.",
