  "purpose": "Importing classes for contextual PGVector ingestion and retrieval, as well as a reranker, likely for a search or machine learning pipeline.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .contextual_pgvector and .reranker",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in the provided code",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted input processing observed in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only import statements with relative paths; no anomalies or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, which does not inherently contain malicious behavior. No external data input, data processing, or network activity is present. The imports suggest modular design, but without further implementation details, there are no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple import statement block with no malicious activity or security risks identified. It appears to be part of a larger project where these classes are utilized elsewhere.",
