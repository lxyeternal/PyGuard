  "purpose": "Importing specific classes for use in a larger application, likely related to vector storage and reranking functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.contextual_pgvector and .reranker)",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or output is shown in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow present in the provided code; it only imports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior detected in these import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, referencing local modules. There are no inputs, outputs, or executable logic that could introduce security concerns. The modules imported appear to be for vector storage and reranking, which are typical in ML or retrieval systems. The code appears clean, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is part of a larger project, and based on this fragment alone, it appears safe.",
