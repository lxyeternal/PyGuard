  "purpose": "Importing classes related to vector storage and retrieval, as well as reranking functionalities, likely for a search or ranking system.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .contextual_pgvector and .reranker",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, input, or output present in this code snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with only import statements; no execution or data processing present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors detected; the code only performs module imports",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules. There are no data reads, no data sinks, and no control flow or execution logic. Since it only imports classes related to vector operations and reranking, there are no apparent security issues or malicious intent within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of module imports with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
