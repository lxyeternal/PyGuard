  "purpose": "Import statements for local modules related to vector retrieval and reranking in a Python project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from '.contextual_pgvector' and '.reranker' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or code execution present.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules; no data flow or execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import statements with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of local module imports with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of these import statements, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. No anomalies or malicious behavior are detected or inferred. The code is typical for modular Python projects and poses no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and appropriate.",
