  "purpose": "Import modules related to PGVector data handling and reranking functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .contextual_pgvector and .reranker",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; imports do not execute untrusted code or handle data directly",
  "flows": "No data flow observed; the code only imports classes/functions from other modules",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward import statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, indicating setup for further processing. There is no execution of untrusted code, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior present. The import structure appears normal for a modular Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple import statement block with no malicious behavior, anomalies, or security risks detected. It merely imports classes or functions needed for further processing.",
