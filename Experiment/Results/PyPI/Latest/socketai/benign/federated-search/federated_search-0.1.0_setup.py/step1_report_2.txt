{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'federated_search' including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading package dependencies, reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; setup configuration and file reading are standard.",
  "flows": "Dependency list flow is straightforward; reading README.md file for long description if it exists.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or credentials present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools for packaging, specifying dependencies, author info, description, and Python version requirements. It reads 'README.md' if available for the long description, which is a common practice. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are used. Dependencies include standard and third-party packages without any indication of malicious intent. The structure and syntax are typical for a setup.py script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
