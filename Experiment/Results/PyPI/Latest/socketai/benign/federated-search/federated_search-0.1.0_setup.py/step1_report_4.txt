  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'federated_search' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion/exclusion rules.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists('README.md') and the list of dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "Reading the README.md file (potential for reading untrusted files if present), installing dependencies.",
  "flows": "If 'README.md' exists, its content is read and included as long_description; dependencies are installed from the list.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.path.exists and open to read 'README.md' content is standard; no suspicious code. No hardcoded credentials, no code injection, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to configure package setup, specifying package metadata and dependencies. It conditionally reads 'README.md' for long description if the file exists, which is a common pattern. The dependencies listed are standard packages, with no indications of malicious code or behaviors. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data leaks. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration file with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It securely handles optional reading of README.md and specifies dependencies clearly. No malicious or suspicious code is present.",
