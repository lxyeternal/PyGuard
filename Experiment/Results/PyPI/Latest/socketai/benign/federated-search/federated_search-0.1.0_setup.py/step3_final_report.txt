  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining metadata, dependencies, and reading README.md if available.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, listing dependencies, package metadata",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network interactions present",
  "flows": "Reading file conditionally, listing dependencies - no malicious data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script using setuptools, with conditional reading of README.md, listing dependencies, and package metadata. It contains no dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1. The code's simplicity and standard practices confirm its benign nature. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present, and the dependency list is typical for such a package. The code does not perform any malicious activity, nor does it contain obfuscation or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
