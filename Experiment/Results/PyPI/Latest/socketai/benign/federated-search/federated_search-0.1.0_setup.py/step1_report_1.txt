  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'federated_search' Python package, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads environment to check for 'README.md' existence, and package configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No untrusted data handling or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Reads file 'README.md' (if exists) for long description during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, utilizing setuptools. It reads package information, dependencies, author details, and optionally reads a README file for description. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Usage of 'os.path.exists' is safe and standard. Dependencies listed are common, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical and benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
