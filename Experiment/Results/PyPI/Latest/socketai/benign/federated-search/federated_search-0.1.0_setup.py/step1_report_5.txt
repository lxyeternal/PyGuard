{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'federated_search'. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion/exclusion rules for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' if it exists, package dependencies list in 'install_requires', package metadata such as name, version, author, and description.",
  "sinks": "Reading 'README.md' file content, specifying dependencies, setting package metadata.",
  "flows": "Source: os.path.exists and open('README.md') -> long_description; dependencies list -> installation process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of common libraries and standard setup procedures. No obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It dynamically reads the 'README.md' file if it exists to populate 'long_description'. Dependencies listed are typical for a data processing or AI-related package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The structure and content are consistent with legitimate package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign package setup configuration with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
