{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'federated_search' Python package, specifying dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the setup script, package discovery via find_packages, reading 'README.md' if it exists.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no execution of untrusted data or code.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content, dependency installation, package setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious URL connections, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, defines package metadata, specifies dependencies, and reads a README file if available. Dependencies include psycopg2, PyYAML, ollama, sentence-transformers, and haystack-ai, all of which are legitimate libraries. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts, with no suspicious or malicious code elements, no dynamic execution, no hidden backdoors, or malicious network calls. The long description reading method is standard practice and safe. Overall, the script appears benign and intended solely for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is standard and safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It serves the purpose of configuring a Python package for distribution, with no anomalies or malicious indicators detected.",
