  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a re-ranking class using a pretrained model. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned malware scores are correct; the security risk scores should be lowered from 0.2 to 0 to accurately reflect the minimal risk. Overall, the supply chain security posture is very low risk, and the code is safe."
