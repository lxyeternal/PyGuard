{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for injection and retrieval operations",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output points are present",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are identified within this code",
  "anomalies": "Use of abstract classes with abstract methods; no anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines two abstract base classes, Injestion and Retrieval, each with a single abstract method. There are no concrete implementations, data handling, or external interactions present. The code appears to be a standard setup for interface definitions, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or other suspicious elements are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely establishes abstract class interfaces without any data processing, input/output, or external calls. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior. It appears to be a benign, foundational piece of a larger system.",
