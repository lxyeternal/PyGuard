{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract base classes for ingestion and retrieval components, likely part of a larger modular system.",
  "sources": "No data input sources or external data reads are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output or security-sensitive sink operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are observable within this isolated code segment.",
  "anomalies": "The class name 'Injestion' appears to be a misspelling of 'Ingestion'. No other anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides abstract classes with method signatures for 'inject' and 'retrieve'. These are intended to be implemented elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The only notable issue is a typographical error in the class name 'Injestion', which could lead to confusion or implementation errors but not security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious set of abstract class definitions. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident, aside from a minor typo that does not impact security.",
