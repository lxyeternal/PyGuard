{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for injection and retrieval operations, likely part of a larger data handling or processing system.",
  "sources": "No specific input sources or data reads; the code defines class interfaces without input handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is processed or output in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; only class definitions with abstract methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code uses standard Python features for abstract classes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two abstract classes inheriting from ABC with abstract methods 'inject' and 'retrieve'. There are no implementations, data processing, or external calls. The code appears to define interfaces for future extension. No signs of malicious behavior or security issues are present. There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward interface definition for abstract classes, with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks detected. It appears safe and standard.",
