{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for ingestion and retrieval operations",
  "sources": "No input data sources; class and method definitions are static",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow or data handling occurs within this code fragment",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of abstract class definitions with no implementation, no hardcoded secrets, and no unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code declares two abstract classes, Injestion and Retrieval, each with a single abstract method. There is no executable logic, no data processing, and no external interactions. Usage of ABC and abstractmethod is standard for defining interfaces in Python. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or potential attack vectors are present. The code appears to be part of a larger framework or system design and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks on its own.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of abstract base classes with no malicious intent or security issues. It functions as interface scaffolding without any harmful or suspicious elements.",
