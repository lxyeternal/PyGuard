  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for data injection and retrieval interfaces",
  "sources": "None; no data input sources are present in this code snippet",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output is present",
  "flows": "No data flow or function calls are evident in this isolated code segment",
  "anomalies": "Code contains a typo in the class name 'Injestion' which appears to be intended as 'Injection'; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines two abstract base classes with abstract methods intended for inheritance. No implementation, data handling, or execution logic exists here. The typo in class name suggests possible oversight or lack of code review but is not malicious. There are no apparent sources or sinks, no data flow, or suspicious code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, intended for defining interfaces, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The typo in class name does not indicate malicious intent but should be corrected for clarity.",
