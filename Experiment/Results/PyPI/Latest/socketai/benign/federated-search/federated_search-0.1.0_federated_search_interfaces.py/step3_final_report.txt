  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for injection and retrieval interfaces in a system.",
  "sources": "No data input, external interactions, or data reading; only class definitions and method signatures.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leakage or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code contains only abstract method declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in class name 'Injestion' instead of 'Ingestion'; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two abstract classes with single abstract methods, serving as interface scaffolding. No concrete implementation, data handling, or external calls are present. The typo 'Injestion' is a minor naming issue, not security-related. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities are evident. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign zero scores for malware and security risk. Confidence levels are high, with minor variation due to the typo. The code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard interface definition with no security risks or malicious intent. The only issue is a minor typo in the class name, which does not impact security but should be corrected for clarity. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk should remain at 0.",
