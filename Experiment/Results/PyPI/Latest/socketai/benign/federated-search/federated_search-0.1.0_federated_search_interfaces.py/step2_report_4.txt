  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the consistency of their assessments, then synthesize an overall evaluation.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Interface definitions for injection and retrieval.  \n- Findings: No data, no external interactions, no anomalies.  \n- Conclusion: Benign, foundational code, no security risks.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. No issues detected.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Similar interface definitions.  \n- Noted typo: 'Injestion' instead of 'Ingestion'.  \n- Findings: No malicious behavior, just a typo.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n**Assessment:** The typo is minor and does not introduce security concerns. The report's conclusion is appropriate.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above.  \n- Findings: No data flow, no implementation, standard use of ABC.  \n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior or security risks.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Interface definitions.  \n- Noted typo: 'Injestion' instead of 'Injection'.  \n- Findings: No malicious activity, just a typo.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.8.  \n**Assessment:** The typo is minor; no security implications. The confidence level is slightly lower but still indicates benign intent.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Interface definitions.  \n- Findings: No data flow, no suspicious behavior, standard pattern.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n**Assessment:** Fully consistent with the code.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence of issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely interface scaffolding with no data handling, no external interactions, and no malicious code.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** The only minor flaw is the typo 'Injestion' instead of 'Ingestion', which appears in multiple reports. This is a spelling mistake, not a security concern.  \n- **Scores justification:** All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5:** None are assigned, which is correct. The code does not perform any operations that could pose security risks.  \n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports, as there's no malicious activity.  \n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** All assessments correctly avoid speculative claims, recognizing that the code is just interface definitions.  \n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected or implied).  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present).  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified).  \n\n### Additional notes:\n- The typo 'Injestion' should be corrected for clarity and professionalism, but it does not impact security.  \n- The code appears to be a standard, benign setup for defining interfaces in a larger system.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the assessments provided. The code is safe, straightforward, and non-malicious.**",
