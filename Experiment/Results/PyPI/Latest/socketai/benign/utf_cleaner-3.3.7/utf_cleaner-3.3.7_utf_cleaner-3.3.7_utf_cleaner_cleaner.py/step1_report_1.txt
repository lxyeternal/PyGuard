  "purpose": "A utility class for removing non-UTF characters from input text, with optional multiprocessing support.",
  "sources": "Input text received via the 'clean' method parameter.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly evident; no untrusted data is sent elsewhere or stored persistently within this code.",
  "flows": "Input text is validated, then filtered for UTF characters either sequentially or via multiprocessing, then logged.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No use of eval, exec, or insecure operations. Logging is standard; no sensitive data appears to be logged.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for cleaning UTF characters. It validates input with an external validator, then filters characters based on a utility function, optionally using multiprocessing. It logs the removal process via an external logger. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are evident. No external data is sent over network, stored insecurely, or executed dynamically. The code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for cleaning text data, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
