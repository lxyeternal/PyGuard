  "purpose": "A utility class for removing non-UTF characters from input text, with optional multiprocessing support.",
  "sources": "Input text passed to the clean() method.",
  "sinks": "Logging function UTFLogger.log_removal, which records original and cleaned text.",
  "flows": "Input text -> validate_input -> filter_with_multiprocessing or is_utf_character -> log_removal.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. Use of multiprocessing is controlled by a parameter, not suspicious. Logging is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input, then either uses multiprocessing or a generator comprehension to filter non-UTF characters. It logs the removal process. All imported modules appear to be related to validation, logging, and utilities, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected. No network activity or system modifications are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for cleaning UTF characters with proper validation and logging. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
