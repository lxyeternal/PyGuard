  "purpose": "A utility class for removing non-UTF characters from input text, with optional multiprocessing support.",
  "sources": "UTFValidator.validate_input(text)",
  "sinks": "UTFLogger.log_removal(text, cleaned_text)",
  "flows": "validate_input -> filtering (either multiprocessing or single-threaded) -> log_removal",
  "anomalies": "Use of validation and logging functions is standard; no unusual code structures, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation and filtering of non-UTF characters. It conditionally uses multiprocessing for filtering, which is a common optimization. Logging of removal activity is straightforward. No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, and no malicious behavior are evident. The functions imported from other modules (validator, logger, utils, multiprocessing_handler) are assumed to perform standard tasks; no evidence suggests malicious intent within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard utility for text cleaning without any malicious intent or security risks. It employs typical validation, processing, and logging mechanisms, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
