  "purpose": "A utility class to remove non-UTF characters from input text, with optional multiprocessing support.",
  "sources": "UTFValidator.validate_input(text), is_utf_character(c), UTFMultiprocessingHandler.filter_with_multiprocessing(text), UTFLogger.log_removal(text, cleaned_text)",
  "sinks": "UTFLogger.log_removal (potential data logging), possible external multiprocessing handling (depends on implementation)",
  "flows": "Input text -> validation via UTFValidator -> filtering via is_utf_character or multiprocessing handler -> logging via UTFLogger -> output cleaned text",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code observed. Usage of validation and logging appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input, processes the text to remove non-UTF characters either sequentially or via multiprocessing, and logs the removal process. All external calls are to imported modules presumed to be standard utilities. No signs of obfuscation, malicious data handling, or suspicious activity are evident. The logging and validation functions are typical for such utilities. Multiprocessing handling depends on external implementation, but its presence does not indicate malicious intent by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for UTF cleaning with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. It relies on external modules for validation, logging, and multiprocessing, which are presumed to be standard or benign.",
