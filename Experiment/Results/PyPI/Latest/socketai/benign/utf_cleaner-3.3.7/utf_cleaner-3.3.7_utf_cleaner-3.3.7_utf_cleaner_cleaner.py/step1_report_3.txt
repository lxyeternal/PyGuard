  "purpose": "A utility class for removing non-UTF characters from input text, with optional multiprocessing support.",
  "sources": "UTFValidator.validate_input(text) for input validation",
  "sinks": "UTFLogger.log_removal(text, cleaned_text) for logging actions",
  "flows": "Input text is validated, then either processed with multiprocessing or filtered character-by-character, followed by logging of the removal process",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed; code appears straightforward and dedicated to text cleaning",
  "analysis": "The code imports validation, logging, utility functions, and multiprocessing handling modules. The class initializes with an option for multiprocessing. The clean method validates input, then processes text either via multiprocessing or character filtering, then logs the removal. The approach appears consistent with text sanitization tasks. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are detected. The only external functions are for validation, logging, and utility processing, which are typical and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for cleaning non-UTF characters from text, with optional multiprocessing support. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this snippet.",
