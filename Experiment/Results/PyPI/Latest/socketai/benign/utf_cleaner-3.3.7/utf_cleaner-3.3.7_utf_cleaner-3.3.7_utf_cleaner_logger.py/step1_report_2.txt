  "purpose": "Configure logging settings and define a utility class for tracking character removals, specifically non-UTF characters.",
  "sources": "Logging configuration and the log_removal method which takes 'original' and 'cleaned' strings as input.",
  "sinks": "Logging output via the logging module, which outputs info-level messages about removed characters.",
  "flows": "Input strings 'original' and 'cleaned' are compared; differences are logged.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. The code performs straightforward logging and comparison.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging and defines a static method to log characters removed from an original string to a cleaned string. It only logs information about non-UTF characters that are removed, which is a benign activity related to data processing or sanitization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data transmission. The code does not contain any suspicious network activity, backdoors, or sensitive data handling beyond logging removed characters. Overall, the code appears to be a utility for character filtering with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility code for logging character removals, with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
