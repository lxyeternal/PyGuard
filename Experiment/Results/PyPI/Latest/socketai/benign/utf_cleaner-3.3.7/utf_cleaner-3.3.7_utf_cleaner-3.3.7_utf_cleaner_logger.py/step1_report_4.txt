{
  "purpose": "Provide logging functionality for tracking non-UTF characters removed from strings.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; the code defines a class with a static method that accepts input parameters.",
  "sinks": "The logging.info call outputs information about removed characters, which could be logged to a file or console.",
  "flows": "The method log_removal takes 'original' and 'cleaned' strings, computes removed characters, and logs this information.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements. Logging usage is standard. No external data access or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a logger at DEBUG level and defines a class with a static method to log non-UTF characters removed from a string. The method computes the difference between original and cleaned strings to identify removed characters and logs this info. There are no external data sources, network activities, or suspicious patterns. The code appears purely functional and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a simple logging utility without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward, focusing solely on logging character removals.",
