{
  "purpose": "Set up logging configuration and define a logger class for tracking character removals, specifically non-UTF characters.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via the 'original' parameter passed to the static method 'log_removal'.",
  "sinks": "The code writes log messages via the 'logging.info' call, which outputs to standard logging handlers configured at the INFO level.",
  "flows": "Input data in 'original' is processed to identify removed characters; if any are found, a log message is generated that includes the removed characters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior detected. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code configures logging with DEBUG level and a specific format. The UTFLogger class provides a static method to log removed characters from an input string, which could be useful for tracking character filtering. No external data sources, network communication, or sensitive operations are present. The code appears to serve a benign purpose related to logging character removal, without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple logging utility for tracking character removals, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, with no anomalies or malware indicators.",
