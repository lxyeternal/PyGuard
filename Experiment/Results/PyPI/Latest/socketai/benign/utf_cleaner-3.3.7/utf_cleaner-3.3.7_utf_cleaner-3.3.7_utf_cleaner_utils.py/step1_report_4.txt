  "purpose": "Check if a given character is a valid UTF-8 character.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'char' received by the function.",
  "sinks": "The 'encode' method applied to 'char', potentially exposing data if misused.",
  "flows": "Input 'char' is encoded using UTF-8; if encoding succeeds, returns True; if fails, returns False.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; the function is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The function attempts to encode a single character in UTF-8 to verify validity. The try-except block handles UnicodeEncodeError to determine invalid characters. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The use of encode is safe and standard. The function does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious activities. Overall, the code appears benign and purpose-specific.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility to verify UTF-8 validity of a character. It does not contain malware or security risks. No suspicious behavior detected.",
