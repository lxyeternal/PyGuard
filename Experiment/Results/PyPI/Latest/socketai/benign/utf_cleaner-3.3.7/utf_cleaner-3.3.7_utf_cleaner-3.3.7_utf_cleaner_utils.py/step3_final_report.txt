  "purpose": "Validate if a character is a valid UTF-8 character by attempting to encode it and catching encoding errors.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'char' received by the function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or external data handling; function returns a boolean based on internal validation.",
  "flows": "Input 'char' -> encode('utf-8') -> success or UnicodeEncodeError -> return True or False.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward validation logic with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to encode a single character in UTF-8 within a try-except block. If encoding succeeds, it confirms the character is valid UTF-8; if it raises a UnicodeEncodeError, it indicates invalidity. The implementation is standard, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The function does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this utility, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No adjustments are necessary as the code is simple, correct, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for UTF-8 validation with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. The function poses no security threat and can be considered safe.",
