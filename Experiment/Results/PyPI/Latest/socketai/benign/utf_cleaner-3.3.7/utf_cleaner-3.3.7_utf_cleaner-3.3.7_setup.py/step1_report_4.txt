  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'utf-cleaner' Python library, defining metadata and package information.",
  "sources": "User input through package parameters such as name, version, description, author, author_email, url, classifiers, and python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data could cause security issues; the script primarily handles package metadata and setup configuration.",
  "flows": "Metadata variables are assigned static strings; no dynamic or external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard setup script with no obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools functions and invokes setup() with static package metadata. There are no external inputs, data processing, or executable code that could pose security risks. The package metadata appears typical and legitimate, and no code injection or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is a normal package configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It solely defines package metadata for distribution purposes.",
