  "purpose": "Define and configure the 'utf-cleaner' Python package setup information for distribution.",
  "sources": "Input sources include static package metadata such as name, version, description, author, author_email, url, classifiers, and python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code solely provides static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors detected. The code uses standard setuptools setup procedure without dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools functions to define package metadata and configuration. It specifies package name, version, description, author info, repository URL, packages to include, classifiers, and Python version requirement. All elements follow standard setup conventions. No input/output, data processing, or code execution based on external input occurs. The code is purely declarative and static, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks. It adheres to standard practices for defining package metadata and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code.",
