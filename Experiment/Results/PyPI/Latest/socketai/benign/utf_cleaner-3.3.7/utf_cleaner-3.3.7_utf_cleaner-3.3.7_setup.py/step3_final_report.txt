  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields such as name, version, description, author, url, classifiers, and python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of package metadata to setup() function; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and uses static values with no dynamic or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools, defines package metadata with hardcoded literals, calls find_packages() for package discovery, and specifies Python version requirements. There are no dynamic inputs, external data reads, network activity, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify this as a benign, standard configuration script. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, with high confidence, reflecting the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports are accurate and consistent with the code's static, straightforward structure. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
