  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the 'utf-cleaner' Python package, specifying metadata, packages, and compatibility.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or execute code from external sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code solely sets up package metadata and configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools, defines package metadata including name, version, description, author, and URL. It uses find_packages() to include all packages in the project. Classifiers specify programming language, license, and OS compatibility. The script enforces a Python version requirement of >=3.6. There are no dynamic executions, external data handling, or suspicious patterns identified. The code does not contain any malicious or malicious-looking elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It solely manages package configuration and metadata.",
