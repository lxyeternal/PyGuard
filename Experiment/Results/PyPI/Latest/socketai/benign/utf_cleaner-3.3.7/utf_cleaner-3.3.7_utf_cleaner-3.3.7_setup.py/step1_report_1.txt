{
  "purpose": "Defines setup configuration for the 'utf-cleaner' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static values for package metadata; find_packages() to discover packages in the directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or sinks present; static configuration data only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; purely static package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no unusual code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools modules and calls setup() with predefined package metadata, including name, version, description, author info, URL, packages, classifiers, and Python version requirement. find_packages() dynamically discovers packages in the directory. There are no user inputs, no dynamic code execution, no file reads beyond package discovery, and no external network activity. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines package metadata for distribution.",
