{
  "purpose": "Defines setup configuration for the 'utf-cleaner' Python package, including metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() call (name, version, description, author, email, url, classifiers, python_requires). No external input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling; no code execution or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code purely declares package metadata without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments. The code is standard package setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools functions and calls setup() with static metadata parameters. It uses find_packages() to locate package modules, which is typical for Python package distribution. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or data processing that could be malicious. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security issues. It simply declares package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
