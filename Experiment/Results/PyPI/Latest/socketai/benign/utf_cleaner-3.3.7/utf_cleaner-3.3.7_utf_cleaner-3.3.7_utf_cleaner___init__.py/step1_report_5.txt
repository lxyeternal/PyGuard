{
  "purpose": "The code installs a Python package directly from a GitHub repository and then imports it, along with a local module.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables (os.devnull), system commands (subprocess.check_call), and network resources (GitHub URL).",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess.check_call to run pip install, and import statements which could potentially execute malicious code if the package is compromised.",
  "flows": "The code fetches and installs a remote package via pip from GitHub, then imports the installed package; data flows from network (GitHub) to local environment, then to import context.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic installation from a remote repository during runtime; no version pinning; no verification of the package integrity; use of broad exception handling that suppresses errors.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically installs a package from a remote GitHub URL without checksum or verification, which could be malicious if the source is compromised. The import of the package 'gits' occurs immediately afterward, which could execute malicious code if the package contains harmful payloads. The use of subprocess for installation and broad exception handling increases risk by suppressing errors and making the process less transparent. The local import from '.cleaner' suggests the code is part of a larger package, but without context, it’s not suspicious by itself. Overall, the main concern is the runtime remote package installation and lack of verification, which could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code dynamically installs and imports a package from an external GitHub repository at runtime without verification, representing a security risk. It could be used to execute malicious code if the remote repository is compromised. The pattern of fetching code during execution is suspicious and warrants caution.",
