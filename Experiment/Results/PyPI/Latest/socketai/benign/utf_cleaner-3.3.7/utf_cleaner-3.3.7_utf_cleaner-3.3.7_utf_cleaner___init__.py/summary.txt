  "conclusion": "The code pattern represents a significant security risk due to dynamic, unverified remote code installation and import, which can be exploited for supply chain attacks. The current scores are appropriate, but a higher malware score (around 0.8) is recommended to better reflect the potential severity. This pattern should be avoided or replaced with validated dependency management practices."
