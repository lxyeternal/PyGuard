{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically installs a Python package from a GitHub repository at runtime and imports it, which introduces significant supply chain security risks.",
  "sources": "The subprocess call executing 'pip install' with a remote GitHub URL; the import of the 'gits' module after installation.",
  "sinks": "The import of 'gits' could execute malicious code if the package is compromised; potential for malicious payloads within the remote repository.",
  "flows": "The code executes a subprocess to install the package from the remote URL, then immediately imports the 'gits' module, which may execute malicious code during import.",
  "anomalies": "Silent broad exception handling suppresses errors, hiding failures or malicious activity; no validation or checksum verification of the downloaded package.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a runtime installation of an external package from an unverified source without validation, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The silent error handling conceals potential failures, increasing risk. The immediate import of the package after installation can execute malicious code if the repository is compromised. The pattern is inherently insecure and dangerous, especially in untrusted environments. The scores assigned in the reports (malware around 0.75, security risk around 0.8) are justified given the behavior. The code itself is straightforward and not obfuscated. Overall, this pattern should be flagged as high risk, and the malware score should be increased to reflect the potential for malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern represents a significant security risk due to dynamic, unverified remote code installation and import, which can be exploited for supply chain attacks. The current scores are appropriate, but a higher malware score (around 0.8) is recommended to better reflect the potential severity. This pattern should be avoided or replaced with validated dependency management practices.",
