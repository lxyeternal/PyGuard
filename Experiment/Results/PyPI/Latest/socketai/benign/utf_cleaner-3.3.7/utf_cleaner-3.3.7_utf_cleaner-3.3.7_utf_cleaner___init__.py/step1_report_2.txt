{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically installs a Python package from a GitHub repository and imports it, along with a local module 'cleaner'.",
  "sources": "Reading from the internet via subprocess call to pip install the GitHub repository; importing installed package 'gits'; importing local module 'cleaner'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executing code from the installed 'gits' package if it contains malicious code, though not directly executed here.",
  "flows": "The subprocess call fetches and installs code from an external repository, which could include malicious payloads; then the 'gits' package is imported, which could execute malicious code if present.",
  "anomalies": "The code silently ignores exceptions during installation; dynamic installation of code from a remote repository at runtime is risky. No validation of the repository's content is performed.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to silently install a package from a GitHub URL, which could contain malicious code. It does not verify the authenticity or integrity of the repository. Importing 'gits' immediately after installation means any malicious payload within that package could be executed. The code's simplicity and lack of validation or security checks are suspicious. The silent pass on exceptions could hide failures or malicious activity. Overall, this pattern is common in supply chain attacks where malicious packages are installed dynamically.\n",
  "conclusion": "The code performs dynamic installation of external code from a GitHub repository without validation, then imports the potentially malicious package. This pattern can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as executing malicious code at runtime. It poses a significant security risk due to unverified remote code execution.",
