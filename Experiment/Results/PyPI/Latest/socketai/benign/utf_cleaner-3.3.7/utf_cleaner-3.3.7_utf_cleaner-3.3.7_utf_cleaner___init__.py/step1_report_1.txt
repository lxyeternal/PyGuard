  "purpose": "The code installs a Python package directly from a GitHub repository and then imports it, along with a local module 'cleaner'.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (sys.executable), executing subprocess calls to install packages, and importing modules.",
  "sinks": "Executing 'pip install' from a remote repository, importing potentially malicious or compromised package.",
  "flows": "Source: sys.executable and subprocess call -> Sink: pip install command -> External source (GitHub URL) -> Imported 'gits' module.",
  "anomalies": "Directly installing a package from a GitHub URL at runtime without validation; no checksums or security validations; importing a module immediately after installation could be risky if the package is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to silently install a package from 'https://github.com/xcummins/gits.git' using pip. It suppresses output to avoid detection. Post-installation, it imports the 'gits' module, which is now available in the environment. This dynamic installation and import could introduce malicious code if the repository is compromised or intentionally malicious. The code does not verify the authenticity, integrity, or source of the package. The use of a try-except block with a broad except clause suppresses errors, which could hide malicious activity or failures.",
  "conclusion": "The code dynamically installs a package from a remote GitHub repository and imports it without validation, which could introduce malicious code if the source is compromised. The practice of silent installation from external sources at runtime poses significant security risks, including potential supply chain attacks.",
