{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to filter non-UTF characters from a given text using multiprocessing for efficiency.",
  "sources": "The function 'filter_with_multiprocessing' takes 'text' as input; the 'is_utf_character' function imported from utils is used as a data source for filtering.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the filtered string; no external or untrusted data sinks are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows into chunk creation, then into '_filter_chunk' via multiprocessing pool, and finally the filtered chunks are joined into a single string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. Usage of multiprocessing and a utility function appears standard. No network or system-level operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code divides input text into chunks based on CPU count for parallel processing, applies a filter to remove non-UTF characters using 'is_utf_character', and then combines the results. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The logic is straightforward, intended solely for filtering characters, with no external communication or insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for filtering UTF characters using multiprocessing. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. The implementation is standard and appropriate for the purpose described.",
