{
  "purpose": "The code provides a multiprocessing utility to filter out non-UTF characters from a given text.",
  "sources": "Input text passed to filter_with_multiprocessing method.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; the code does not output untrusted data directly, only processed text.",
  "flows": "Input text -> divided into chunks -> each chunk processed in parallel by _filter_chunk -> combined back into a single string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiprocessing pool is standard; no suspicious code execution or obfuscated logic observed. The function is straightforward and appears safe.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiprocessing tools and a utility function is_utf_character, then defines a helper function _filter_chunk that filters non-UTF characters from text chunks. The class UTFMultiprocessingHandler includes a static method filter_with_multiprocessing, which splits the input text into chunks based on CPU count, processes each chunk in parallel, and then joins the results. There are no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or hidden code. The code performs a benign operation of filtering characters and utilizes multiprocessing in a typical manner. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of multiprocessing text filtering with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply processes text to remove non-UTF characters in a parallel manner, which appears safe.",
