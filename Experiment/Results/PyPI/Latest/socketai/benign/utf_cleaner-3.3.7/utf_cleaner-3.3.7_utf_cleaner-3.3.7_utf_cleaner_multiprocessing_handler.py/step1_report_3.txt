{
  "purpose": "The code filters non-UTF characters from a given text using multiprocessing for performance.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' in the method 'filter_with_multiprocessing'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain external data sinks or untrusted data outputs beyond processing local variables.",
  "flows": "The source 'text' flows into chunking logic, then into the '_filter_chunk' function executed in separate processes, and finally concatenates filtered chunks back into a single string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard multiprocessing practices. The 'is_utf_character' function imported from '.utils' is not shown, but assuming it performs a character check, this appears typical.",
  "analysis": "The script divides input text into chunks based on CPU count, then filters non-UTF characters in parallel using multiprocessing. The '_filter_chunk' function filters characters based on 'is_utf_character'. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. The code’s structure appears straightforward and intended for performance optimization.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign text filtering task using multiprocessing. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. It appears to be a standard utility for character filtering.",
