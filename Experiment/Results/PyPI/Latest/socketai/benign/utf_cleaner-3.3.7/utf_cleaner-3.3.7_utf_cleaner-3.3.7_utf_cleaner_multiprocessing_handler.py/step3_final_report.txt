  "purpose": "Filter non-UTF characters from a text using multiprocessing for efficiency.",
  "sources": "Input text data processed in chunks within filter_with_multiprocessing method.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; processing occurs entirely in-memory.",
  "flows": "Input text is divided into chunks, each processed by _filter_chunk, then recombined.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; reliance on external is_utf_character utility assumed safe.",
  "analysis": "The code splits input text into chunks based on CPU count, filters each chunk for UTF characters via _filter_chunk, which uses is_utf_character, then joins the filtered chunks. No network, file, or malicious operations are present. The logic is straightforward and standard for multiprocessing filtering tasks. The external utility function is assumed safe; no obfuscation or backdoors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of multiprocessing-based UTF character filtering. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
