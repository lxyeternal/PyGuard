  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for UTF cleaning error handling.",
  "sources": "None; no input data reading is performed in this code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as no data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward class inheritance for custom exceptions with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. There are no external data inputs, no data processing, and no interactions with external systems or resources. The constructor of InvalidInputError sets a default message but does not involve dynamic code execution or sensitive data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be standard, minimal exception class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign definition of custom exception classes for error handling related to UTF cleaning. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
