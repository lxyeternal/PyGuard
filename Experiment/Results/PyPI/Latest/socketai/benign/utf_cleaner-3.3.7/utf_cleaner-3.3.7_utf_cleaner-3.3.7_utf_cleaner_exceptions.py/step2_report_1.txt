  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, external data handling, or malicious constructs.\n   - The code is straightforward and benign, serving as part of an error handling mechanism.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly state that the code does not involve data flow, external inputs, or suspicious behavior.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1, with obfuscated, malware, and securityRisk scores all at 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, indicating no risk, there's no need to justify higher scores.\n   - The code does not pose any security threat or malware risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Analysis:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0.\n   - This is correct; the code contains no malicious behavior or intent.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's static structure.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, straightforward implementation of custom exception classes, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores.\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is benign and serves a standard purpose within larger applications.",
