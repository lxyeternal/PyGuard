{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for UTF cleaning errors and invalid input validation.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read; only class definitions and exception handling are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs are evident in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from input to output or processing functions; the code solely defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward class inheritance for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base exception class 'UTFCleaningError' and a derived exception 'InvalidInputError' with a default message. There are no data input sources, external calls, or suspicious constructs. The code appears to be standard exception class definitions meant for use elsewhere in a larger application. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code's simplicity and clarity further reduce suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of custom exception classes for error handling related to UTF cleaning. It contains no malicious behavior or security issues.",
