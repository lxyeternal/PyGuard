  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only defines two simple exception classes.\n   - No runtime data handling, external data sources, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - The code is straightforward and contains no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n   - **Conclusion:** There are no issues or malicious behaviors in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - **Note:** The reports are thorough and align well with the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports conclude no malicious activity or security risks, risk scores should remain very low or zero.\n   - The code does not involve any data processing, external interactions, or dynamic execution.\n   - **Conclusion:** No justification exists for higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports agree on malware score 0.\n   - The code contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n   - **Confirmed:** Malware score should be 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports base their conclusions on the code's static nature and lack of suspicious elements.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n   - **Validated:** The assessments are justified.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable scores are observed.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a simple, standard implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No security issues, malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final notes:** The code is benign and serves a typical purpose in error handling. No further action or concern is warranted.",
