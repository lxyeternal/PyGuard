  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The original code consists solely of two class definitions for custom exceptions, with no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify this and conclude that the code is benign and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that there are no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct.  \n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security issues.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports conclude the code is benign, and there's no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the simplicity and transparency of the code.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Rationale**: The code is purely definitional, with no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. They correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**Final recommendation**: No changes needed; all scores and conclusions are justified and reasonable.",
