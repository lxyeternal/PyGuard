  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling UTF cleaning errors and invalid input errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; only class and exception definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leakage points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code only defines exception classes without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard exception class definitions with descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from built-in Exception types. The classes are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated elements, or data handling that could be malicious. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or potentially malicious constructs. The structure and content are typical for error handling in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of custom exceptions related to UTF cleaning errors. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks are present.",
