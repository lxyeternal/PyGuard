  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling UTF cleaning errors and invalid input errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading observed in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or processing sinks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward class definitions for exceptions; no suspicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception base class, intended for error handling related to UTF cleaning processes. The classes include a base exception and a more specific invalid input error with a default message. There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or security-sensitive operations. The code appears to be standard exception class definitions without any hidden or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
