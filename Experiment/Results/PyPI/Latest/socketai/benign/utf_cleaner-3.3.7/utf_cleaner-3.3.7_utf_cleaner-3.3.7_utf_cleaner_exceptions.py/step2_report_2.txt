  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code defines two custom exception classes:\n     - `UTFCleaningError` (base class)\n     - `InvalidInputError` (derived class with a default message)\n   - There are no functions, data processing, external data inputs, or outputs.\n   - The code is straightforward class inheritance, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.\n\n2. **Issue Presence:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely definitional and contains no malicious behavior.\n   - No issues are present in the code itself; it’s standard exception class definitions.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly state that there are no suspicious elements, no data flows, and no security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable since there are no security issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Potential for Higher Scores:**\n   - Since the code is simple and safe, increasing scores would be unjustified.\n   - The confidence level of 1 is appropriate, reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n\n6. **Claims about Vulnerabilities:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities; they correctly state that the code is benign and standard.\n\n7. **Consistency:**\n   - All reports are consistent with each other and with the code content.\n\n8. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a minimal, safe, and standard implementation of custom exceptions.\n   - No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- The current scoring appears accurate.\n- I would keep the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- The confidence remains at 1, as the analysis is straightforward.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the code’s nature.",
