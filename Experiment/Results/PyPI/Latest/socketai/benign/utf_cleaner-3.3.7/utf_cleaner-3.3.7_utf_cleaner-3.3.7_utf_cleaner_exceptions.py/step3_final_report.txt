  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for UTF cleaning errors and invalid input handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for UTFCleaningError and InvalidInputError; no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class inheritance structure with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two class definitions for custom exceptions, with no dynamic behavior, data handling, external interactions, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the benign and straightforward nature of the code, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0. The confidence level is high (1), as the code is static and simple. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard part of error handling with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
