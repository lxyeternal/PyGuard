  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**  \nThe provided code defines two custom exception classes: `UTFCleaningError` (a base class) and `InvalidInputError` (a derived class with a default message). The code is straightforward, with no dynamic behavior, data processing, external interactions, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code\n- **Are the issues described in the reports actually present?**  \n  **Yes.** The reports accurately describe the code as simple class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports\n- **Logical or reasoning flaws?**  \n  The reports are consistent and correctly interpret the code as benign.  \n- **Are there any overlooked issues?**  \n  No. The reports are thorough and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n### Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue\n- **Confidence:** All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is not obfuscated.  \n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5\n- **Are any scores higher than 0.5?** No. All are 0 or 0.5 or below, indicating no significant security concern.  \n- **Should any be higher?** No. The code is benign.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate malware score\n- **Malware score is 0 across all reports.**  \n- **Is this accurate?** Yes. The code contains no malicious elements.\n\n### Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities\n- **Are there any assumptions?** The reports assume the code is only class definitions with no malicious intent.  \n- **Is this reasonable?** Yes. Given the code, this assumption is justified.\n\n### Step 7: Check consistency of scores\n- **Scores are consistent across reports.**  \n- **Overall, the assessments are aligned with the code's nature.**\n\n---\n\n### Final step: My own assessment\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, non-obfuscated, benign set of exception class definitions with no external interactions, data handling, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **The reports are accurate and consistent.**  \n- **The code is benign and does not pose security risks.**  \n- **Scores assigned are appropriate.**  \n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores as they are: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
