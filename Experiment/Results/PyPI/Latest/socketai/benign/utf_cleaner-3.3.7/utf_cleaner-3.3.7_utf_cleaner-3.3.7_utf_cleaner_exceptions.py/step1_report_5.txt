  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for UTF cleaning errors and invalid input handling.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; code defines classes only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code solely declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from the base Exception class. The InvalidInputError class provides a default message. There are no external inputs, outputs, or processing; the code simply sets up exception hierarchies. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, establishing exception classes without any malicious intent or security risks. It serves as part of a larger application to handle specific error conditions.",
