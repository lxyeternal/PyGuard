  "purpose": "Validator for UTF-8 strings to ensure input is a string type.",
  "sources": "Input data passed to validate_input method as 'text'.",
  "sinks": "Potential exception raising if input is invalid, but no harmful sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is checked; if invalid, an exception is raised. No data flows to external sinks or network.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a validator class with a static method that checks if the input is a string. If not, it raises an exception. There are no external calls, network activities, or data leaks. The exception is based on type validation only. The code is simple and appears safe. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic input type validation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility function.",
