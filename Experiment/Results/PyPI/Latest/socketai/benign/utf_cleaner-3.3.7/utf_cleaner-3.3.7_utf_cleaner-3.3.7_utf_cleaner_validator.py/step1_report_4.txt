  "purpose": "Validator for UTF-8 strings to ensure input is a string type.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' in validate_input method.",
  "sinks": "Potentially raising InvalidInputError if input is not a string.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' -> type check -> potential exception raise.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple validator class with a static method that checks if the provided input is a string. If not, it raises an InvalidInputError. The module imports a custom exception but does not contain any data leakage, network activity, or suspicious behavior. The logic is straightforward and does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic validation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose with no anomalies or suspicious elements.",
