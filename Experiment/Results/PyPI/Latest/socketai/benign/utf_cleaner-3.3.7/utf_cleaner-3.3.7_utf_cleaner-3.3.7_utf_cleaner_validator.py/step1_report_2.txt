  "purpose": "Validator class for checking if input strings are valid UTF-8 strings, raising an exception if not.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' in validate_input method",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; potential exception raised based on input validation",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is checked for type; if not string, an exception is raised",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed; code appears straightforward and purpose-specific",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a static method that validates whether the input is a string. It raises an 'InvalidInputError' if the input is not a string. There are no external data reads, network calls, or data leaks. The only check is type validation, which is standard. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple input validation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a basic type check and raises a custom exception if validation fails. No malware or security threats detected.",
