  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple type check on the input, raising a custom exception if the input is not a string. It imports an exception class from an external module, which is standard. No external data flows, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The logic is straightforward and benign. The exception handling is minimal and does not introduce security risks. The code does not verify UTF-8 encoding explicitly, but in Python 3, strings are Unicode, so the check suffices for type validation. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward input validation utility with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The purpose is to ensure the input is a string, raising an exception otherwise. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
