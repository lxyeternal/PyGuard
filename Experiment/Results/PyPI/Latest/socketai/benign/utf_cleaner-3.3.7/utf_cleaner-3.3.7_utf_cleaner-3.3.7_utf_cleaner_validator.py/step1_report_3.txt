  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' in the validate_input method.",
  "sinks": "Raising InvalidInputError, which could trigger exception handling logic elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is checked for type, and if invalid, an exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code performs a simple validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a static method to validate input as a string. It raises a custom exception if the input is not a string. There are no malicious behaviors, data leaks, or suspicious operations. The import is straightforward, and the validation logic is simple and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a basic input validation component with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
