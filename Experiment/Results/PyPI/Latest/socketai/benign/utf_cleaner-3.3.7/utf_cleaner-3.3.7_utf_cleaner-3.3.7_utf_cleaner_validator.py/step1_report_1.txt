  "purpose": "Validator for checking if input is a UTF-8 string, raising an error if not.",
  "sources": "Input data passed to the validate_input method (the 'text' parameter).",
  "sinks": "Potentially raises an exception (InvalidInputError) if input is not a string; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is checked; if not a string, an exception is raised, otherwise no further flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated parts. The only unusual aspect is the reliance on an exception class imported from elsewhere, which appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple validator class with a static method that verifies if the provided input is a string. If not, it raises a custom exception. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or insecure operations. The code is minimal, straightforward, and appears to be a standard validation routine. No suspicious data flows or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic input validation with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a safe and typical validation implementation.",
