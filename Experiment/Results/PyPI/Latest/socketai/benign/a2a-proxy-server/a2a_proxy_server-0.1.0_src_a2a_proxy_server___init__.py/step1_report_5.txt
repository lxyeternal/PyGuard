{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and starts a proxy server that loads agent configurations from YAML files, creates agent cards, and registers agents with the server.",
  "sources": "Reads agent configuration files via open() in load_agent_config(). Uses environment variables loaded with load_dotenv() to configure runtime environment.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data. External dependencies (e.g., server registration, loading YAML files) are standard and not suspicious. No network connections are initiated by the code itself.",
  "flows": "Configuration files are read as source inputs; agent creation functions process data; registered with server which manages the agents.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Use of environment variables is standard. No suspicious network activity or code injections detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads environment variables, reads YAML config files, and creates agent objects with specified skills and capabilities. It then registers agents with a proxy server and starts the server. All operations are standard for a server setup; no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are present. The code handles errors gracefully and uses logging appropriately. No hardcoded credentials, external network connections, or potentially malicious data flows are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup for a proxy server managing agents. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It uses common libraries and standard patterns for server initialization and configuration loading.",
