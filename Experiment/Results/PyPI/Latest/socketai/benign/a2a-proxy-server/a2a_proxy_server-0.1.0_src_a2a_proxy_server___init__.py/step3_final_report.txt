  "purpose": "Load agent configurations from YAML files, create agent objects, and register them with a proxy server for a multi-agent system.",
  "sources": "YAML configuration files, environment variables, command-line options for host, port, and config paths.",
  "sinks": "Agent registration on the server, network communication with specified URLs, and creation of agent skills and capabilities.",
  "flows": "Configuration files are read (load_agent_config), data is used to instantiate AgentSkill, AgentCapabilities, and AgentCard objects, which are then registered with the server via register_agent method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures detected. No external data flows or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads configuration data securely using yaml.safe_load, creates agent objects with provided parameters, and registers them with a server. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. Exception handling and logging are standard. The primary external concern is the trustworthiness of configuration files, which could be malicious if supplied by an attacker, but this is outside the code's logic. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are detected. The code uses standard libraries and practices, and the data flow is straightforward from config files to agent registration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate server setup and agent registration tool with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the external configuration files' integrity. The code itself is safe, and scores are consistent with the analysis.",
