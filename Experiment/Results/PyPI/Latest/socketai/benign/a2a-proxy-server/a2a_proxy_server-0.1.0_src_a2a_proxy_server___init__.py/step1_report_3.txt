{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and runs a proxy server that loads agent configurations from YAML files, creates agent cards, and registers agents with the server.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files specified by command-line options; loads environment variables via load_dotenv(); reads agent config data from YAML files.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no direct data leaks or insecure data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reads configuration data -> creates agent cards -> registers agents with the server -> starts server.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual behavior or hidden code features.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard server setup for managing agent configurations. It loads environment variables, reads YAML config files, constructs agent objects, and registers them with a server. The use of external libraries like dotenv, yaml, and click are appropriate for configuration and CLI. No evidence of malicious intent such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or credential theft. The code does not contain any malicious or suspicious code snippets, and there are no security risks beyond typical application configuration. It relies on external inputs (config files), but there are no apparent security issues in handling these inputs. Overall, the code seems legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard server initialization and configuration loading with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate component for managing agent configurations in a server environment.",
