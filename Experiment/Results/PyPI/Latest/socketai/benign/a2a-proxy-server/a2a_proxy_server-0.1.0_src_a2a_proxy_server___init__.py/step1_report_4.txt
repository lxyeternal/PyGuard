{
  "purpose": "This script initializes and runs an A2A proxy server, loading agent configurations from YAML files, creating agent cards, and registering agents with a server.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files specified via command-line options; loads environment variables; loads agent config data from YAML files.",
  "sinks": "Uses loaded configs to instantiate objects and register agents; no direct data sinks that transmit untrusted data over networks or to external systems.",
  "flows": "Loads configuration files -> creates agent objects and capabilities -> registers agents with the server -> starts server.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration data from YAML files and environment variables, then uses this data to construct agent objects with specified capabilities and skills. The creation process appears standard, with no signs of malicious input handling or data leaks. The server registration process involves passing data structures built from trusted configuration data. There are no indications of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code primarily focuses on setup and registration of agents, with proper exception handling and logging. No suspicious network activity or credential handling was observed beyond standard configuration loading. Overall, the script appears to be a typical server setup for agent management, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for managing agents on an A2A proxy server. It loads configurations, constructs agent objects, and registers them securely, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
