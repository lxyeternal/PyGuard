  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Loads environment variables via `load_dotenv()`.\n- Loads YAML configuration files for agents.\n- Creates `AgentSkill`, `AgentCapabilities`, and `AgentCard` objects.\n- Registers agents with a proxy server.\n- Uses command-line options for host, port, and config files.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures are evident.\n- No network activity beyond server registration.\n- Exception handling and logging are in place.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes configuration loading and agent registration.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data sinks; flows are standard.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The low malware and security risk scores align with the analysis. The slight security risk is due to external config trust, not code flaws.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; standard environment and file loading.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data transmission.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; standard setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security 0.1, Obfuscated 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. The minimal security risk reflects external config trust, not code issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Similar to previous reports; standard server initialization.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security 0.2, Obfuscated 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious signs.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Similar findings; straightforward configuration and registration.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security 0.2, Obfuscated 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Same conclusion: standard setup, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security 0.2, Obfuscated 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code analysis—no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly higher (0.1–0.2), justified by reliance on external configs which could be malicious if untrusted, but not due to code flaws.\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n*Justification:* No malicious code, network activity, or payloads are present.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n*Justification:* Code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0.1**  \n*Justification:* The primary risk stems from external configuration files. If these are malicious, they could introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports' conclusions and scores are consistent with the code.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The main concern is external configuration trust, not the code itself.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0. The security risk score can be slightly increased to 0.1 if considering external config trust, but overall, the code is safe.",
