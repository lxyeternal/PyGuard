{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and runs a proxy server for agents, loading configurations from YAML files, creating agent cards, and registering agents with the server.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables via load_dotenv(), reads YAML configuration files via open() and yaml.safe_load(), and accepts command-line options for host, port, and config file paths.",
  "sinks": "Uses the loaded configuration data to instantiate objects and register agents; no untrusted data is directly written to external systems or network communications are explicitly shown as untrusted data sinks in this code.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are loaded at startup, configuration files are read from disk, agent configs are parsed and transformed into objects, and then registered to the server, which then starts accepting connections.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures detected. Use of environment variables via dotenv is standard, and the YAML config loading is typical. No obfuscated code, malicious network calls, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration loading, object creation, and server registration steps. It uses well-known libraries like dotenv, yaml, and click. The data flows from configuration files into internal objects with no evidence of malicious data manipulation. No insecure practices such as code injection, data leakage, or unsafe network behavior are apparent. The code's logic appears straightforward, with no hidden or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard server setup and agent registration utility, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates within normal parameters for a configuration-driven server application.",
