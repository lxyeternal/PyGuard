  "purpose": "A proxy server handling agent requests, delegating to task managers, and returning JSON or event streams.",
  "sources": "Request body JSON payloads, request path parameters, and internal method calls to task_manager methods.",
  "sinks": "Response serialization via JSONResponse or EventSourceResponse, and internal method calls.",
  "flows": "Request received -> validation with A2ARequest.validate_python -> delegation to task_manager methods based on request type -> response generated via _create_response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity; exception handling is standard; no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API proxy built with standard libraries, employing validation, routing, and structured exception handling. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. Error handling converts exceptions into generic error responses, which is typical. No external malicious connections or backdoors are evident. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.2 are justified given the benign and standard nature of the implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
