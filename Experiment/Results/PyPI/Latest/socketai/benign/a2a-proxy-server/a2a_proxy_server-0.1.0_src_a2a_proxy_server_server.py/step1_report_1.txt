  "purpose": "A proxy server for handling agent requests, managing tasks, and returning appropriate responses.",
  "sources": "Request body (JSON data from incoming POST requests), URL path parameters (agent_id), request headers (implicitly via Request object).",
  "sinks": "Response generation (JSONResponse, EventSourceResponse), logging functions, exception handling (potentially exposing internal errors).",
  "flows": "Request data is read from incoming request body; agent_id from URL parameters; processed through validation; depending on request type, calls are made to task_manager methods; results are returned via response functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. No use of unsafe eval or exec. No obfuscated code features or unnecessary dynamic code execution. Proper exception handling present. No suspicious domain connections, file modifications, or network data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a server proxy built with Starlette and Uvicorn, primarily routing requests based on agent_id and request type. It validates incoming JSON RPC requests, delegates to task_manager methods, and returns JSON responses or event streams. Error handling converts various exceptions into structured JSON error responses. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. Usage of standard libraries and typical request handling patterns suggests legitimate functionality. Absence of hardcoded secrets or insecure operations indicates low risk of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of an API proxy for agent-task management with proper validation and error handling. No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks are present based on the provided code. Overall, the code seems safe with low malware and security risk scores.",
