{
  "purpose": "This code manages AI agent tasks asynchronously, initializing tools and agents based on configuration, processing tasks, streaming responses, and updating task states.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, external modules (`get_tools`, `create_agent`, `run_agent`, etc.), and the `print` statement for debugging.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur via the `print` statement exposing internal tool configurations; no other suspicious sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to task management functions, external module calls, and the `print` statement; task responses flow back through async functions and streaming responses.",
  "anomalies": "The only minor anomaly is the `print(\"Tools: \", tools)` statement, which could leak internal info if logs are exposed; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard async task manager for an AI agent, relying on external modules assumed safe. It initializes tools and agents, processes tasks, streams responses, and updates task states. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is evident. The print statement is a debugging artifact and not malicious. External modules' safety cannot be guaranteed but is outside this code's scope. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious activity. The only minor concern is the debug print statement, which could leak internal info if logs are exposed. Overall, the security risk is very low, and the code does not pose a supply chain threat.",
