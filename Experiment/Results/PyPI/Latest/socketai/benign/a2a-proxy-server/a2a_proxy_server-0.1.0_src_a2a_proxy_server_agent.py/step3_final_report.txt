  "purpose": "Manage AI agent setup, message conversions, and execution flow for a conversational AI system.",
  "sources": "Input messages from task history, tool info from MultiServerMCPClient, and internal configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Converted messages sent to AI model, potential debug logs that could expose internal info.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from task history to message conversion functions, then to agent invocation or streaming, with debug info printed during process.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of debug print statements revealing internal tool info and errors; no malicious code or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard message handling, agent creation, and invocation using reputable libraries. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code. Debug logs could leak info but are typical during development. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature, considering minor info leakage risk from logs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation of an AI agent pipeline with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor security concern is debug logging, which should be managed appropriately in production. Overall, the code poses no security threat or supply chain risk.",
