  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if reported issues are present in the code**\n\nAll reports are empty (\"Empty response\"), so there's no specific information about vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or flaws. Without explicit reports, I cannot identify any issues or malicious activity in the code.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the code for potential vulnerabilities or flaws**\n\nThe provided code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It appears well-structured, with no obvious security flaws or malicious code. Notably:\n\n- No use of untrusted input.\n- No code execution or obfuscated code.\n- No suspicious dependencies or external code inclusion.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores and claims**\n\nSince no reports contain details, I cannot verify or challenge any claimed scores. The absence of data prevents assessment of malware, obfuscation, or risk scores.\n\n**Step 4: Critical assessment**\n\n- **Malware score:** Given the code is a straightforward setup script, the malware score should be 0 unless there's hidden malicious code, which isn't evident here.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is clear and readable; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Without evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity, the risk score should be low, probably close to 0.\n\n**Step 5: Final evaluation**\n\n- The code itself appears benign.\n- No evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities based on the provided snippet.\n- The empty reports prevent any detailed assessment or challenge.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Score | Justification                                               |\n|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0.0               | No malicious code or behavior present.                      |\n| Obfuscated     | 0.0               | Code is clear and straightforward.                           |\n| Risk           | 0.1               | Very low risk; standard setup script with no evident issues.|\n\n**Note:** If future reports contain specific details, I would reassess accordingly. As it stands, the package appears safe and free of malicious or obfuscated code.",
