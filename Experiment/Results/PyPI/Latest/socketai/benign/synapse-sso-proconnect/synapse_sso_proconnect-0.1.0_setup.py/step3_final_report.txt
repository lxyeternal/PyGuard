  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code is a static configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code executes in a controlled environment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain any embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. All reports provided are empty or contain no details, indicating no identified issues. The code adheres to standard practices, with no hardcoded secrets, external code execution, or insecure patterns. Given the absence of evidence, the likelihood of malicious intent or vulnerabilities is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code appears benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All available reports are empty, and the code itself is straightforward and standard. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
