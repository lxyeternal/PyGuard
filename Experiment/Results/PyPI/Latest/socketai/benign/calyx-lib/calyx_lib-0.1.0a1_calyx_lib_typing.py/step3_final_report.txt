  "purpose": "Type definitions and protocol declarations for translation and text handling in a Python project.",
  "sources": "Imports from pathlib, typing, mcdreforged.api.rtext, mypy_extensions; type alias assignments; class definition of Subscriptable Protocol.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code contains only type annotations and interface definitions.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; purely type aliasing and protocol declaration without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of runtime logic, data handling, or external input; straightforward type definitions; no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed solely of type aliases, imports, and a Protocol class. It does not perform any runtime operations, data processing, or external input handling. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The detailed reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores all at 0. The code's simplicity and clarity support these conclusions, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard set of type definitions and protocol interfaces for translation-related data structures. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
