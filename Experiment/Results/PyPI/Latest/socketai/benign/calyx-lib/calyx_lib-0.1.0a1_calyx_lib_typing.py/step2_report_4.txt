  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The code provided is primarily type definitions, imports, and protocol declarations. There are no runtime data flows, external input handling, or dynamic code execution. The reports indicate \"Empty response\" for reports 1, 2, 3, and 5, and report 4 contains a detailed analysis.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   The detailed report (report 4) correctly identifies that the code is purely declarative, with no malicious or security-sensitive behavior. It notes the absence of external data handling, dynamic execution, or secrets.  \n   The reports labeled as \"Empty response\" do not provide any specific issues, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**  \n   Since the detailed report assigns malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores all at 0, and the analysis confirms the code is benign, these scores seem appropriate.  \n   The \"Empty response\" reports don't have scores, which is acceptable given their lack of content.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports suggest any security concern that would warrant a higher score. The code is straightforward type definitions with no runtime or dynamic behavior.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any malicious actions—no code injection, external calls, or suspicious patterns. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   The detailed report does not make unwarranted assumptions; it correctly states that the code is benign and mainly consists of type annotations and protocols.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. The overall assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard set of type aliases and protocol definitions for translation and text handling. There are no security concerns, vulnerabilities, or malicious elements present. The scores assigned in the detailed report are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain dependency appears safe based on the provided code snippet and analysis.",
