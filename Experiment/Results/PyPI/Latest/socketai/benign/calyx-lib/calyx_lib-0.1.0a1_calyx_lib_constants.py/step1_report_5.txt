  "purpose": "Define package metadata and configuration variables for the CalyxLib Python library.",
  "sources": "Importing os module, defining string constants, reading __file__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code consists solely of variable assignments and static data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and sets several metadata variables, including package name, version, URL, and description. It calculates the package path dynamically using os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)), which is a common pattern. There are no external data inputs, user inputs, or sensitive data handling. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or obfuscated code present. The code appears to be standard setup/configuration code with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical configuration snippet for a Python package, containing no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely defines static variables for package identification and description.",
