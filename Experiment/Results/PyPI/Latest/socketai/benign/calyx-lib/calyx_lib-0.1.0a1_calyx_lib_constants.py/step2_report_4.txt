  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely configuration, involving static variable assignments and path resolution.\n- No dynamic input, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated code is present.\n- The code's purpose appears to be setting package metadata and resource paths.\n- No signs of malicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippets do not contain any malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- The use of `os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))` is standard for determining package directory paths.\n- The URLs and version strings are static and seem legitimate.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation are present.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward code.\n- Security risk: 0, since there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- Since all reports are consistent and thorough, and the code is simple configuration, no adjustments are necessary.\n- The confidence level is 1.0, which is appropriate given the clear benign nature.\n- The lack of dynamic behavior or external dependencies further supports the benign assessment.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard configuration snippet with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes are needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, and the reports are accurate. It serves as a typical package configuration file with no security risks.",
