  "purpose": "Define package metadata and configuration variables for the CalyxLib Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string values and uses os.path.abspath with __file__ to determine the package path.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network communication, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes constants related to package identity, versioning, URLs, and language resources. It uses os.path.abspath with __file__ to determine the package directory, which is a standard pattern. There are no inputs from external or untrusted sources, nor any outputs that could leak data. No malicious patterns or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be purely for configuration purposes, with no suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet defining package metadata and resource paths. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
