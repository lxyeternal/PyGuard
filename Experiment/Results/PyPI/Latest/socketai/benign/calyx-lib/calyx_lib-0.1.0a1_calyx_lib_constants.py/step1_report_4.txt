  "purpose": "Define metadata and configuration constants for the CalyxLib Python package.",
  "sources": "Static values assigned to variables, os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)) to get current directory",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no external data processing or user input reading present",
  "flows": "N/A - all variables are statically assigned; no data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets static configuration variables such as package name, version, URLs, and paths. It uses os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)) to determine its directory, which is a standard practice. There are no functions, input/output operations, or code execution that could be exploited maliciously. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any external data transmission, credential handling, or dynamic code execution. Overall, the code appears safe.",
