  "purpose": "Define package metadata, version info, URLs, and determine package path for configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file path using __file__ and os.path functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; all variables are statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, defines static constants for package info, and uses os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)) to determine the package directory. There are no dynamic inputs, network operations, or malicious code. The code is typical for package setup scripts. All signals indicate benign configuration with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration snippet with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
