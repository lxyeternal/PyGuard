  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, file/network operations, data processing points",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points",
  "flows": "Input/read sources to potential sinks such as network transmission, file modification, or environment variable exfiltration",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code appears standard and benign",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate either no code or benign code with routine data handling. Malware scores are consistently 0, obfuscated scores are 0, and security risk scores are mostly 0.2, reflecting low but cautious baseline risk. Given the absence of malicious indicators or obfuscation, the scores are appropriate. For reports with no code, setting risk to 0 would be more precise. Confidence levels are high due to the lack of suspicious activity, and no inconsistencies are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. Scores are appropriate; minor adjustments could include lowering risk scores for reports with no code. Overall, the assessment is consistent and justified.",
