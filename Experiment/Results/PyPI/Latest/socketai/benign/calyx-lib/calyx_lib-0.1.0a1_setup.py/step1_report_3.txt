  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package, used to define package metadata, dependencies, and other installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, 'README.md' for long description, and constants from 'calyx_lib.constants'.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly interacts with untrusted data sources or executes untrusted code; primarily reads static files and constants.",
  "flows": "Reads static files (requirements.txt, README.md) and constants, then passes data to setup() for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is standard for a Python package setup script; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt', and package metadata from 'constants'. It constructs setup parameters and calls setup() from setuptools. The code appears to be a typical setup script with no signs of malicious or suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads static configuration files and constants, and performs package setup accordingly.",
