{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' and 'README.md' files, importing constants from 'calyx_lib'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script primarily reads files and passes data to setup().",
  "flows": "Input from files ('requirements.txt', 'README.md') flows into variables used in setup().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; use of constants suggests external control, but no malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The script loads dependencies and metadata from files and constants, then calls setup() to package the project. It does not execute untrusted code, make network connections, or perform any malicious actions. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The only point of concern could be reliance on external constants; however, they appear to be intended for configuration, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this script.",
