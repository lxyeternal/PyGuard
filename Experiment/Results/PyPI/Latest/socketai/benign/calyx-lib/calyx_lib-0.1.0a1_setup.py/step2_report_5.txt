  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward setup script; no suspicious activity, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; standard setup script, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a typical setup script. Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small security risk (0.1) noted, possibly due to reliance on external constants.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable given the context.\n- **Assessment:** Justified. No malware, but external constants could theoretically be manipulated if compromised, hence the small risk score.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous, standard setup. Slightly higher confidence (1) and small risk (0.1).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — justified.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity. The code only reads static files and constants, then calls `setup()`. No network, code injection, or obfuscation detected.\n  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero across all reports; no obfuscation present.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0.1) in some reports due to external dependencies (constants), but no real security threat.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code, no backdoors, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, related to external constants possibly being manipulated if the source is compromised, but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | 0              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0              |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1            |\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured setup script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The small risk score reflects the dependency on external constants, which is typical and not inherently dangerous unless the source is compromised.\n\n**Final note:** The scores given in the reports are reasonable and align with the code's behavior. No adjustments needed.",
