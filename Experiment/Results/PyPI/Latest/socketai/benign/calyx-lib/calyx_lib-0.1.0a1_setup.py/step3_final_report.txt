  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project, reading dependencies, metadata, and configuring installation.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt', 'README.md', and imports 'constants' from 'calyx_lib'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and constants, then passes data to 'setup()' without dynamic execution or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. It relies on external static files and constants, which are typical for such scripts. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The constants module is assumed to contain static configuration data. The minimal security risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports accounts for reliance on external constants but does not indicate actual risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and aligns with typical packaging scripts. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are justified and appropriate.",
