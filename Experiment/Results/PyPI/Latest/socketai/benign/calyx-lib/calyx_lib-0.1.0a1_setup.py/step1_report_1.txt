{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python project, configuring metadata and dependencies for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads input from 'requirements.txt' and 'README.md' files.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is used directly in security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and documentation from 'README.md', then passes this data into the setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic. Usage of constants from an external module is typical for configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily loads external files for dependencies and documentation, then calls setuptools.setup() with project metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated code, or suspicious network or file operations. All actions are standard for a Python package setup process. The use of 'constants' module for configuration is common, assuming it contains only static data. No code injection, malicious activity, or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
