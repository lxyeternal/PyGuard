{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring metadata and dependencies for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and package metadata from 'constants' module, reads 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable if 'constants' contains malicious or manipulated data; no direct untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'requirements.txt' and 'constants' module into setup configuration; no untrusted input flows to insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. No network, file, or system modification operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads dependency list and long description files, and sets up package metadata using setuptools. The 'constants' module provides package-specific variables such as name, version, description, and URL. All file reads are straightforward, with no user input or external data source other than static files. There are no indicators of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The code performs standard package setup operations without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It properly reads configuration data and prepares the package for distribution. No anomalies, malware, or security threats identified.",
