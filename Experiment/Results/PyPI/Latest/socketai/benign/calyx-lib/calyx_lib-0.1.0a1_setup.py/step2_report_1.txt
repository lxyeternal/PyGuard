  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no malicious code, standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no issues detected. The score aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard setup script, reliance on constants is typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable and consistent. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard setup process, reading static files and constants.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Analysis:** Slightly elevated securityRisk due to reliance on external constants, but no actual malicious activity. The low risk score is acceptable given the context.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous, no suspicious behavior, standard package setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the analysis; no issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no malicious activity, straightforward setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated in some reports (0.1), justified by reliance on external constants which could, in theory, be manipulated if external control over 'constants' exists. However, given the code context, this is a minimal and acceptable risk level.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** Considering the reliance on external constants, a small risk score (0.1) is reasonable, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to external constants, but very low risk overall)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, and the scores are appropriate given the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
