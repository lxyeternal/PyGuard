{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package for distribution by reading dependencies, metadata, and configuring package details.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, 'README.md' for long description, and constants from 'calyx_lib'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input data from files (requirements.txt, README.md) is used for package configuration; no data flows to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets (beyond author's email which is benign), or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations: reading static files, importing constants, and configuring package metadata. The use of constants for package name, version, description, and URL suggests configuration-driven design, not malicious intent. No code injection, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The only dynamic aspect is reading dependencies from a file, which is normal. The author's email and URLs are hardcoded but not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a typical Python package setup file with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It only reads local files and uses constants for configuration, with no evidence of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
