{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for file and string operations, including directory handling, text cleaning, string formatting, and listing bundled files within directories or ZIP archives.",
  "sources": "Reads from os, re, pathlib, zipfile, and potentially external objects passed as parameters such as 'obj' in represent().",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly write to or modify external systems or send data over networks.",
  "flows": "N/A (no untrusted data flow leading to security impacts identified).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets observed. The code primarily performs standard utility operations. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious code snippets.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions with clear, common purposes. The 'list_bundled_file' function reads directory listings from the filesystem or ZIP archives, which is standard. The 'represent' function constructs a string representation of objects, filtering out private attributes and blacklisted fields. The string cleaning functions remove color codes using regex patterns, which are safe operations. No functions perform network operations, system modifications, or handle sensitive credentials. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for utility purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a set of safe utility functions with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs common filesystem and string processing tasks without side effects or suspicious activities.",
