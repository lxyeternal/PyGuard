  "purpose": "Utility functions for directory management, string manipulation, file listing in packages, and object representation.",
  "sources": "os.path.isdir, os.makedirs, re.compile, re.sub, os.listdir, ZipFile.infolist, vars()",
  "sinks": "None that directly process untrusted input in a malicious context; no data leaks or command execution points identified",
  "flows": "Input strings (e.g., 'text', 'directory_path', 'package_path') are processed through regex or filesystem functions but without untrusted external data flows leading to harmful actions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Functions perform standard utility tasks. The code comments and imported modules are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for directory creation, string cleaning, filename listing within ZIP archives, and object representation. No user input is handled in a way that can lead to code injection or data exfiltration. The ZIP file processing appears safe and limited to listing contents. No obfuscated code, malicious network activities, or credential leaks are present. The functions are straightforward, standard, and do not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign utility functions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware or suspicious activities. It is safe for use as a dependency.",
