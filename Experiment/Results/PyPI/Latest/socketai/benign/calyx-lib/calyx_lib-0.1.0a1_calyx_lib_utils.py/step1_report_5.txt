  "purpose": "Utility functions for file and string manipulation, primarily for directory management, text cleaning, and object representation.",
  "sources": "Reads from os.path, environment variables (via os), and input parameters; reads from zipfile infolist.",
  "sinks": "None identified that directly lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; functions are utility and do not process untrusted input in a dangerous manner.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code appears to perform straightforward utility tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions: creating directories, cleaning color codes from strings, formatting strings, listing files in directories or zip archives, and representing objects. All operations involve standard library functions with no apparent data injection, network access, or system manipulation. The 'list_bundled_file' function processes zip archives but only reads metadata without extracting or executing content. No code suggests malicious intent such as data exfiltration or system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "This code comprises standard utility functions with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs safe file and string operations suitable for integration into larger projects. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
