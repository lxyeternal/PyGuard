  "purpose": "Utility functions for file and string operations, including directory handling, color code cleaning, string formatting, and listing bundled files within packages.",
  "sources": "Reading directory contents with os.listdir, reading zipfile infolist, and accessing object attributes via vars().",
  "sinks": "Potentially, list_bundled_file reads package files and returns filenames; represent accesses object vars, but does not write or send data externally.",
  "flows": "list_bundled_file reads package or zip contents; represent inspects object attributes; other functions process strings locally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network or file operations, no dynamic code execution, and no unusual data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions: touch_directory creates directories; cleaning functions remove color codes; string functions format text; list_bundled_file retrieves filenames from directory or zip packages; represent generates string representations of objects. All functions operate locally on input parameters, with no external communication, no use of untrusted data sources, and no dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign utility code intended for local file and string processing. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as documented, with safe handling of data, and no suspicious behaviors.",
