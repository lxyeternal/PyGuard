  "purpose": "Utility functions for directory management, text cleaning, string manipulation, and file listing from packages or ZIP archives.",
  "sources": "os.path.isdir, os.makedirs, re.compile (used in cleaning functions), os.listdir, ZipFile.infolist, vars(obj)",
  "sinks": "os.makedirs (creates directories), os.listdir (reads directory contents), ZipFile.infolist (reads ZIP contents), vars(obj) (accesses object attributes)",
  "flows": "Input paths (directory_path, package_path, directory_name) to filesystem or archive reads; vars(obj) to string representation functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no unusual or malicious code behavior detected; functions are straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions with no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of untrusted input data from external sources beyond filesystem paths. The list_bundled_file function reads ZIP archive info, which is standard for listing package contents. The represent function creates string representations of objects based on their attributes, with no suspicious filtering. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for handling directories, string cleaning, and listing files in packages or ZIP files. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The code is straightforward and safe.",
