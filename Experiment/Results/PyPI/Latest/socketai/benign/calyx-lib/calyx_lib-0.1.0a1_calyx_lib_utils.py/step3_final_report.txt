  "purpose": "Utility functions for filesystem operations, string cleaning, string formatting, listing files in directories or ZIP archives, and object representation.",
  "sources": "Filesystem directories, ZIP archive infolist, string inputs, object vars",
  "sinks": "None; functions do not process untrusted data in a harmful manner",
  "flows": "N/A; all functions perform safe, straightforward operations without external data flows",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is standard, straightforward, and uses common libraries",
  "analysis": "The code comprises benign utility functions with no network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior. Regex operations are safe for cleaning strings. Directory and ZIP listing functions are standard and do not handle untrusted data insecurely. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with malware scores of 0 and low risk scores (~0.1-0.2). The functions are straightforward, and the code is well-structured. No vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, standard utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. The overall security posture is benign, and no modifications are necessary.",
