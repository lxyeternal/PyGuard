{
  "purpose": "The code performs data processing, environment variable reading, or system interactions with no evident malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, standard input, network sources, user inputs, system calls, subprocess executions.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, subprocess commands, environment variables, data outputs, potential command execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network data flow into processing functions or command execution points, potentially leading to data leakage or system modification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hidden network connections detected; code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets described are simple, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The confidence levels are high (0.8-0.9), and the scores reflect low risk (0.2-0.3). The lack of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity supports a benign assessment. Slightly elevated risk scores in some reports account for potential misuse in larger contexts, but no evidence indicates actual malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent and indicate benign code with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified, and the risk scores appropriately reflect minimal concern given the descriptions. No adjustments are necessary.",
