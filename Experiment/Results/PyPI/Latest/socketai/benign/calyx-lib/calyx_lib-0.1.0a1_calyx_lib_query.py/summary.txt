  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured utility for pattern matching and command execution in a server plugin. No malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are detected. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), justified by the command execution capability but no evidence of malicious activity."
