  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and uses standard SDKs without malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security concern is external API security and potential data leakage, not the code itself. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
