{
  "purpose": "The code sets up an asynchronous server that interacts with an external SDK to run agents and serve their data over a network interface.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters 'acp_url', 'agent' name and description, and data from 'client.agents()' stream",
  "sinks": "Returns output from 'run.output', raises exceptions with 'run.error', and exposes agent data in JSON format via HTTP resources",
  "flows": "Input 'acp_url' and agent details flow into SDK calls; agent outputs and statuses flow from SDK responses to server responses and exceptions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors observed; code appears standard for a service interface",
  "analysis": "The code imports SDK modules, defines an async server setup function 'serve', and within it configures a tool 'run_agent' that executes agent runs via the SDK, handling different run statuses. It also registers agent data as resources accessible over the server. The flow is straightforward: it queries agents, registers their data, and serves asynchronously. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The code uses standard async patterns and SDK functions without suspicious modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate service interface for running agents via a provided SDK, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
