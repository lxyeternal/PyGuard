{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface to start an ACP server over MCP by calling the serve function with a provided URL.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from command-line arguments (the 'url' parameter).",
  "sinks": "The 'serve' function is called with the provided URL; this may involve network communication based on the implementation of 'serve'.",
  "flows": "User supplies 'url' via command-line -> 'serve' function invoked with 'acp_url' parameter -> network operations likely occur within 'serve'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code patterns detected. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward function calls.",
  "analysis": "The code imports asyncio and a 'serve' function from 'acp_mcp.server'. It defines a CLI function that parses command-line arguments for a URL, then runs 'serve' asynchronously with that URL. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or potential malicious behaviors. The 'serve' function's internal behavior isn't shown, so potential malicious activity within 'serve' cannot be assessed, but the code itself is benign and typical for a command-line server startup script.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a straightforward CLI wrapper to start a server with a user-specified URL. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior in this code segment.",
