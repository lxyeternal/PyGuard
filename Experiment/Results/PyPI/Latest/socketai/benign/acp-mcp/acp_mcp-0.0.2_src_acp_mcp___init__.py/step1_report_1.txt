{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a command-line interface to serve ACP agents over MCP, connecting to a specified URL.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from command-line arguments (the URL parameter).",
  "sinks": "Uses the provided URL to call the serve() function from acp_mcp.server, which likely establishes network communication.",
  "flows": "User supplies URL -> asyncio.run(serve(acp_url=args.url)) -> network connection to specified URL.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code constructs, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it parses a single command-line argument 'url', then runs an asynchronous server using that URL. The serve() function is imported from an external module, which is not included here, so its behavior cannot be assessed. The code uses asyncio for asynchronous execution, and the CLI is standard. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident within this fragment. There are no hidden backdoors, data leaks, or malicious system modifications visible. The code’s security depends primarily on the serve() implementation, which is external and not reviewed here.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, functioning as a CLI wrapper to start a server at a user-specified URL. No malicious activity or security issues are detected within this code segment. However, since serve() is external, its security cannot be confirmed here.",
