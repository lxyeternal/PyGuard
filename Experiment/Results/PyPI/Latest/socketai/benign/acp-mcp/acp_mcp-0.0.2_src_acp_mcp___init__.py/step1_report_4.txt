{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to serve ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) agents over MCP (Message Communication Protocol) by running an asynchronous server.",
  "sources": "Reads user input via command-line argument 'url' for the ACP server URL.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'serve' function imported from acp_mcp.server, which likely initiates network communication based on the provided URL.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument 'url' flows into the 'serve' function to start the server; no other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or data leakage identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports asyncio and a server module, defines a CLI that accepts a URL parameter, and runs an asynchronous server. It relies on an external 'serve' function from acp_mcp.server, which is not detailed here. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It functions as a typical command-line utility to start a server process based on user input.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for starting an asynchronous server with a user-supplied URL. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation within this code fragment.",
