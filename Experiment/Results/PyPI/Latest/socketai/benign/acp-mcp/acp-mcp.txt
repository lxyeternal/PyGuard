      "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI wrapper with no malicious intent or security issues. The overall security posture relies on the external serve() function, but the snippet itself is safe. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and uses standard SDKs without malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security concern is external API security and potential data leakage, not the code itself. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
