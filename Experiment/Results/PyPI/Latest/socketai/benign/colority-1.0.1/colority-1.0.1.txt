While no active malicious activity is detected, the large, nonsensical encoded string decoded at runtime raises suspicion. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate; the malware score should remain low (0.2), the obfuscation high (around 0.6-0.75), and the overall risk moderate (around 0.3). Further static or dynamic analysis of the decoded payload is recommended to confirm its safety."
