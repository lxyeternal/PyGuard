  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code to verify the claims, identify any inconsistencies, and determine appropriate risk scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on console output management, wrapping sys.stdout/stderr with AnsiToWin32, with cleanup via atexit. No malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Code match:** The code indeed wraps sys.stdout and sys.stderr, uses atexit for cleanup, and manages internal state with global variables. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.\n- **Risk assessment:** The score of 0.0 for malware and 0.0 for security risk is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code's purpose is benign, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1—console stream handling, wrapping, cleanup, no malicious code, standard patterns.\n- **Code match:** The code's logic aligns with the description. Uses global variables, wraps streams, registers cleanup, no network or data exfiltration.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware score of 0 and security risk of 0.1 seem appropriate, considering the global state manipulation.\n- **Justification:** Slightly elevated security risk due to global state changes, but still benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, console output handling, wrapping, platform-specific behavior, cleanup.\n- **Code match:** The code's functions match the description—initialization, wrapping, cleanup, no suspicious activity.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware score of 0, security risk 0.2 is acceptable.\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher security risk due to global variables, but nothing malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on ANSI support, wrapping sys.stdout/stderr, cleanup, internal state reset for tests.\n- **Code match:** The code contains `_wipe_internal_state_for_tests()`, which resets internal variables—this is typical for testing, not malicious.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.1, matching the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity; the internal reset function is standard in test setups.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others—console stream wrapping, platform-specific behavior, cleanup, no malicious activity.\n- **Code match:** The code's logic matches the description. Uses global variables, wraps streams, registers cleanup.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware score 0, security risk 0, aligns with the benign purpose.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious patterns, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, appropriate given the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are justified due to global state management, but overall, the risk is minimal.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a standard utility for managing console output streams, especially on Windows, with functions for wrapping, resetting, and platform-specific console handling. It employs common patterns (e.g., context managers, atexit cleanup) and contains no malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code. The internal reset function for tests is a common pattern in development environments.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious intent or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, primarily due to global state manipulation, which is standard in such utilities)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is benign, well-understood, and free of security concerns.",
