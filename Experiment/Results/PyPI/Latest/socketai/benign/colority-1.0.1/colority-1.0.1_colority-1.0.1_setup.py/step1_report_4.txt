  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'colority' Python package, including metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools and the call to setup() with package metadata and configuration.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no execution of untrusted input, no network or file operations, no credential handling.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only defines package metadata and discovery, no data flows or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup functions from setuptools and invokes setup() with package details such as name, version, author, description, classifiers, package discovery, and Python version requirement. All elements are typical for Python package configuration scripts. No malicious code, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code strictly serves as package setup configuration without any runtime logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file.",
