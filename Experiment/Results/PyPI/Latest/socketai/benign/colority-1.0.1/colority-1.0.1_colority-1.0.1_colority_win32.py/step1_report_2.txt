{
  "purpose": "The code provides a wrapper around Windows console API functions to manipulate console properties such as screen buffer info, text attributes, cursor position, console title, and console mode.",
  "sources": "Library imports (ctypes, wintypes), system calls to kernel32 DLL functions (GetStdHandle, GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo, SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, FillConsoleOutputCharacterA, FillConsoleOutputAttribute, SetConsoleTitleW, GetConsoleMode, SetConsoleMode).",
  "sinks": "Functions that set console text attributes, cursor positions, fill console output, and set console title, which can potentially affect the display or behavior of the console window.",
  "flows": "Input data such as stream identifiers, colors, positions, and titles flow from function parameters into system calls that modify console state.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes detailed console manipulation functions but no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. There are no evident attempts at data exfiltration, network communication, or covert operations. The code appears to be a standard Windows console utility wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically loads Windows API functions for console management, providing functions to retrieve and modify console buffer info, text attributes, cursor position, and title. The functions perform straightforward system API calls with appropriate argument checks. No obfuscated code, network activity, or suspicious logic is present. The code does not perform any external communications or data leaks. It appears to be a benign utility for console control.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of Windows console API wrappers intended for manipulating console appearance and behavior. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or sabotage features. The overall security risk is very low, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
