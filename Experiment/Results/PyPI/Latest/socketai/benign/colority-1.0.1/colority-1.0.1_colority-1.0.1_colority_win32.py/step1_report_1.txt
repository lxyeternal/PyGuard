  "purpose": "This code provides Windows console manipulation functions, including setting text attributes, cursor position, console title, and buffer info.",
  "sources": "Reads handle values via _GetStdHandle, retrieves console info, and reads environment/state via winapi functions.",
  "sinks": "Calls to console functions that affect display or retrieve console info; no direct data leakage or untrusted input handling is present.",
  "flows": "Console handle acquisition -> info retrieval or attribute setting -> display manipulation functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network activity. Usage is limited to console management.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads Windows API functions related to console management, with proper argument and return type definitions. It includes functions to get console info, set text attributes, cursor position, and title. All functions interact with the Windows console API and do not perform any network operations or system modifications beyond console handling. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The code is well-structured and appears to serve legitimate purposes related to console manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focusing on console API calls for display and info retrieval. It does not exhibit malicious intent or behaviors. There are no indications of malware or security risks.",
