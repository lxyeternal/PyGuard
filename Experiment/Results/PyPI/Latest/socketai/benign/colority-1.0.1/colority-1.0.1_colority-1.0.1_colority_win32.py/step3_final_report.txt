{
  "purpose": "The code provides a set of functions to interact with Windows console APIs for tasks such as retrieving console buffer info, setting text attributes, cursor position, console title, and mode. It is intended for console display and control.",
  "sources": "Reads input from standard handles (_GetStdHandle), retrieves console buffer info (_GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo), and console mode (_GetConsoleMode).",
  "sinks": "Potentially where untrusted data could influence console output or attributes, such as SetConsoleTextAttribute or FillConsoleOutputCharacter, but in this context, these are internal API calls without external data input.",
  "flows": "The functions typically read handle info, manipulate console attributes or position, and set console properties, with no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward API wrapper functions with proper argument types.",
  "analysis": "The code loads Windows console API functions dynamically, defines structures for console info, and provides utility functions for console manipulation. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or modify system files. The functions are standard and well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly set to 0. The risk score is low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concern given the code's utility nature. The overall behavior is benign, with no data leaks, backdoors, or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Windows console API wrapper intended for console management. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its benign purpose.",
