  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no backdoors, straightforward construction of escape sequences.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0. Overall safe.  \n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate; the code is a benign utility.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; no external input, no malicious behavior, standard pattern.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1 (very low).  \n- **Assessment:** The security risk score is reasonable; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above; straightforward utility, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.0.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, dynamic wrapping of class attributes with escape sequences is standard.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Standard utility, no external data, no malicious code.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores of 0 are appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores of 0 are justified.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is reasonable.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 (a minimal security risk, mostly due to potential misuse in untrusted environments, but not a vulnerability per se)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a straightforward, safe utility for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal formatting. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Summary statement:**  \nThe code is a benign terminal formatting utility with no malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk features. The provided scores accurately reflect its safety profile.",
