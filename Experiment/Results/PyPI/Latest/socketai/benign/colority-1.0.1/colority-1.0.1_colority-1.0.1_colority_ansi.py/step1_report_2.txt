{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting, including colors, styles, cursor movement, and screen clearing.",
  "sources": "None explicitly present; the code defines constants and functions for generating escape sequences, but does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the functions returning escape sequences could be used as sinks if combined with untrusted data, but by themselves they are static utility functions. No direct data leak, network activity, or system modification is performed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the functions are for formatting and control sequences only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. The class methods and constants are straightforward and serve a display formatting purpose.",
  "analysis": "The module is a collection of utility functions and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting and cursor control. It does not perform any input/output operations, network communication, or data manipulation that could be malicious. The functions simply construct static escape sequence strings. The classes initialize their attributes with escape sequences based on predefined codes, which is a normal pattern for such utility modules. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious constructs are present. The code is well-structured, clear, and standard for terminal formatting libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for generating ANSI escape sequences, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not read untrusted data, connect to external systems, or perform any harmful actions. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate terminal formatting helper module.",
