  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting, including colors, styles, and cursor positioning.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions for color and style codes, functions constructing ANSI escape sequences.",
  "sinks": "Functions returning strings with embedded ANSI escape sequences; no external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Constant values are wrapped with escape sequences upon object instantiation; no untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and classes for ANSI escape sequences, used for terminal formatting. The AnsiCodes class dynamically wraps class attribute values with escape sequences during initialization. No user input, external data, or untrusted sources are processed. The code is straightforward, primarily consisting of static mappings and string formatting functions. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a utility library for terminal styling without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for generating terminal ANSI escape sequences. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk is very low.",
