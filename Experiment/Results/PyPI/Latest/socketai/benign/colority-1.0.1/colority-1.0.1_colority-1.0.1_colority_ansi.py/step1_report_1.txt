{
  "purpose": "The module provides functions and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting, including colors, styles, and cursor positioning.",
  "sources": "Constants defining escape characters (CSI, OSC, BEL), input parameters for functions (e.g., 'title', 'mode', 'n', 'x', 'y'), class attribute values for color codes.",
  "sinks": "String concatenations constructing ANSI escape sequences and escape sequences returned by functions, which are used to format terminal output.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are embedded into escape sequence strings via concatenation, resulting in sequences that modify terminal display or cursor position.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code purely constructs escape sequences. No dynamic execution, external network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for ANSI escape sequences and classes to generate formatted strings for terminal output. The functions and classes are straightforward, constructing strings based on input parameters without executing any external or system commands. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, network communication, or data leakage. The use of class inheritance to generate color codes and styles is standard for such utility modules. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility for terminal formatting with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal text styling. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe for use as a terminal formatting library.",
