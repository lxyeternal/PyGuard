{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal text styling, cursor movement, and screen control.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines constants, class attributes, and functions that generate static strings.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; functions return strings based on parameters or constants.",
  "flows": "The functions construct escape sequences from input parameters or class attributes; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and classes for ANSI escape sequences, initializing class attributes with escape codes. No external data, dynamic code execution, or network activity occurs. The functions generate static strings for terminal styling and control. The implementation is standard for such utilities, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0-0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal formatting. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk features are present. The scores assigned are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
