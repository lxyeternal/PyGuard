{
  "purpose": "The code generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting, including colors, styles, cursor movements, and screen clearing.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it defines functions and classes for generating control sequences.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs string sequences for terminal control; no direct data leaks or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; functions return control sequences based on internal parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of class attributes and dynamic attribute setting is standard for such utility modules.",
  "analysis": "The module is a straightforward utility for generating ANSI escape codes, including color, style, cursor movement, and screen clearing sequences. It employs simple string concatenation and class attribute management. The dynamic setting of instance attributes in AnsiCodes is a common pattern for initializing color/style sequences. There is no indication of input handling, external data processing, or any behavior that could be malicious. The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or system commands that could be harmful. Overall, it is a benign, well-structured utility library for terminal control sequences.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard ANSI escape code generator library with no malicious intent or security risks. It provides terminal formatting features without executing external commands or handling untrusted data. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
