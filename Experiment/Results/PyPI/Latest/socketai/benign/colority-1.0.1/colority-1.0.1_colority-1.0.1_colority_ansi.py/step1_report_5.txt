  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape codes for terminal coloring and cursor control.",
  "sources": "Definitions of ANSI escape sequences, class attribute values, method parameters for cursor movement, and string concatenations for escape sequences.",
  "sinks": "String concatenations that produce terminal control sequences; no external data inputs or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; all data used in string formation are constants or method parameters with default values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or hidden functionalities identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants, classes, and methods to produce ANSI escape sequences for terminal formatting and cursor control. It employs standard string concatenation to generate control codes. The class initializers set up attribute values without any external data input or malicious logic. The methods for cursor movement and style setting are straightforward and do not perform any operations beyond returning formatted strings. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious commands, or backdoors. Overall, the code appears to be a standard utility for terminal styling, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for terminal ANSI styling and cursor control. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides methods and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal output styling.",
