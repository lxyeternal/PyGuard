  "purpose": "Unit tests for modules handling ANSI to Win32 console conversion, stream wrapping, and Windows console mode detection.",
  "sources": "Imports from io, unittest, contextlib, mock, and internal modules; Mock objects and patched functions for environment simulation.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data flows, external network or file system interactions, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Tests interact with mock streams and environment variables; no actual data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. Usage of mocks and environment patching is standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of unit tests for console stream wrapping and ANSI sequence handling. It uses mocking and environment patching to simulate different OS and console states. No data leakage, system modification, or malicious payloads are present. The code does not include any network, file system, or credential manipulation, nor does it execute untrusted code or obfuscate logic. The test suite is designed for functionality verification without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for console handling modules with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, employs common testing practices, and does not contain any malicious payloads.",
