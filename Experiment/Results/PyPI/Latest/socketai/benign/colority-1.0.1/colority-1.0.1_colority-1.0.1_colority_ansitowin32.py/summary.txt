  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate terminal styling utility with embedded static data that appears obfuscated. While no active malicious activity is detected, the large, nonsensical encoded string decoded at runtime raises suspicion. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate; the malware score should remain low (0.2), the obfuscation high (around 0.6-0.75), and the overall risk moderate (around 0.3). Further static or dynamic analysis of the decoded payload is recommended to confirm its safety."
