  "purpose": "Unit tests for ANSI escape sequences and color attributes in a terminal styling library.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, unittest, and internal modules (ansi, ansitowin32); no external data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "The code flows through attribute assertions and setup/teardown routines within test cases; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward testing logic with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports system and testing modules, sets up test cases to verify ANSI escape code constants, and restores sys.stdout and sys.stderr after tests. It contains no external data input, no network operations, no code execution based on external input, and no obfuscated or suspicious patterns. The tests simply check the correctness of predefined ANSI escape sequence strings.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test suite verifying ANSI color code constants. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. It is safe and legitimate.",
