  "purpose": "Unit testing module for ANSI color and style codes, verifying correct attribute values.",
  "sources": "sys.stdout, sys.stderr, imported modules (ansi, ansitowin32), and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs attribute checks and resets stdout/stderr.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, external data reads, or suspicious code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of test cases verifying ANSI escape code constants. It resets sys.stdout and sys.stderr in tearDown, but these are standard procedures in tests. There are no dynamic data inputs, no external data sources, no network activity, and no suspicious or obfuscated code patterns. The code does not perform any harmful or malicious actions, nor does it include backdoors, data leaks, or security-related vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward unit testing script verifying ANSI code constants. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks.",
