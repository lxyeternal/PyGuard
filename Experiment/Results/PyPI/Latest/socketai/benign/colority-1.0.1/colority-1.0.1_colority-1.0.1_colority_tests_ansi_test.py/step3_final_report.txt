  "purpose": "This code is a set of unit tests verifying the correctness of ANSI escape sequence constants for foreground, background, and style attributes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the imported modules and internal constants (Fore, Back, Style). It does not process external input or untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects; the code only performs static assertions.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves static assertions on predefined constants; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and internal constants, then performs assertions to verify ANSI escape code values. It manages sys.stdout and sys.stderr during tests, but only for test isolation. There is no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity. The assertions are static, hardcoded checks. No secrets, credentials, or sensitive data are involved. The code's purpose is purely validation of static constants, with no malicious or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit testing script verifying ANSI escape sequence constants. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and risk: 0 are appropriate and should be maintained.",
