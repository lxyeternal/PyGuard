{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module import statement related to Pyarmor, a tool used for code obfuscation and licensing.",
  "sources": "The code imports a runtime component from the same package/module, which may be used internally for deobfuscation or licensing checks.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident in this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates a trial version of Pyarmor with an expiration date, which may suggest licensing enforcement but not malicious intent. No suspicious or unusual code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with an associated comment indicating the use of Pyarmor trial. There are no functions, input handling, or network activities. The import may be part of a larger obfuscated or protected codebase, but this fragment alone does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a benign part of a protected or obfuscated codebase, likely related to licensing enforcement. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks on its own.",
