{
  "purpose": "The code imports the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for obfuscation or licensing purposes within a protected Python package.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports a module without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating a Pyarmor trial version; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement associated with Pyarmor obfuscation tooling. No malicious activity, network communication, or data leaks are present. The comment indicates a trial license, which is typical in protected codebases. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: ~0.2, securityRisk: ~0.1) are consistent with the benign, obfuscation-related purpose of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's simplicity and context suggest it is part of a legitimate obfuscation or licensing mechanism, not malicious or vulnerable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a runtime import for obfuscation or licensing enforcement. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
