  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module for code protection or obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code imports a module named __pyarmor__ from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only performs an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates a trial version of Pyarmor with an expiration date; no suspicious or malicious code behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a runtime component of Pyarmor, which is a legitimate obfuscation/protection tool for Python code. The comment references a trial version with an expiration date. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows that could lead to security issues. The code's simplicity and lack of network or file operations suggest no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward import statement for Pyarmor runtime, used for obfuscation or license management, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
