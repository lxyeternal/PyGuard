{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for code obfuscation or licensing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing __pyarmor__ from the current package",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the import is static and does not process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicating usage of Pyarmor trial version; no suspicious code behavior or hardcoded credentials observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment and a single import statement. The comment specifies the version of Pyarmor, a known obfuscation tool, and that it is a trial version. The import statement loads a runtime component, likely for executing obfuscated code. There are no dynamic or suspicious behaviors, no data processing, and no network or system modifications. The code appears to be part of an obfuscation or licensing mechanism, which is typical in protected Python applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a runtime import for obfuscation or licensing purposes. There are no indicators of malicious activity, malware, or security risks.",
