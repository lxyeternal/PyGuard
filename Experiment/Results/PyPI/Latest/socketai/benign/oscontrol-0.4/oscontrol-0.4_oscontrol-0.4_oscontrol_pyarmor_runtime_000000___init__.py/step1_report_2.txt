{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for code obfuscation or licensing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing __pyarmor__ from the local package.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; import statement does not involve untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of Pyarmor trial version comment, which suggests obfuscation or licensing management, but no malicious code or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a single import statement from a relative module __pyarmor__, which is associated with the Pyarmor obfuscation tool. The comment indicates a trial version of Pyarmor 9.0.6. No other code, network activity, or data handling is present. This is a minimal, legitimate import statement. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident based on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement related to Pyarmor licensing or obfuscation, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be part of an obfuscated or protected script, but the code snippet itself is benign.",
