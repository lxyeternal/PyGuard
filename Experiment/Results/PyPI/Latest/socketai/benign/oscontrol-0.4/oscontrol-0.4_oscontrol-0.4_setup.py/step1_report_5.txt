{
  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for the Python package 'oscontrol' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools; hardcoded package metadata (name, version, author, description, classifiers, python_requires).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or user input; no network, file, or environment variable usage.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code primarily sets package metadata and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration file for packaging a Python library. It imports the necessary functions from setuptools, specifies package metadata, and calls setup() with predefined values. The only dynamic element is the Python version requirement ('==3.13.*'), which is consistent with a specific Python version. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The code follows common packaging practices and contains no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
