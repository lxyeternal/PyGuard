  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'oscontrol' Python package, including metadata and package discovery settings.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data; it primarily specifies static package configuration data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; the code only declares package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The python_requires spec '==3.13.*' is unusual but not malicious, potentially indicating a restrictive dependency requirement.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and defines a setup configuration for a package named 'oscontrol'. It specifies package metadata, version, package inclusion, and compatibility with Python 3.13.*. The setup function is standard, with no dynamic code execution or external data handling. The strict 'python_requires' could prevent installation on other Python versions, but it does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a straightforward package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The most notable aspect is the highly specific Python version requirement, which is not malicious but somewhat unusual.",
