  "purpose": "A standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields such as name, version, packages, description, author, classifiers, and python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; the script does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "The 'python_requires=\"==3.13.*\"' line specifies a Python version that is not yet released, which is unusual and could cause deployment issues but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup configuration with no dynamic code, external data, or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature and note the unusual Python version requirement. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately set to 0. The security risk score is minimal (around 0.1), reflecting the potential deployment problem rather than malicious intent. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The minor version specification issue does not constitute a security threat but should be corrected for proper deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration script with a minor misconfiguration in the Python version requirement. All reports are accurate, and no malicious activity or security risks are detected. The overall security posture is safe, with a very low risk primarily due to the version specification anomaly.",
