{
  "purpose": "The code provides a comprehensive framework for handling HTTP responses, including parsing, streaming, response wrapping, and file operations, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous workflows.",
  "sources": "Response objects (`httpx.Response`), request parameters, headers, response content, response stream generators, input parameters for response type and streaming options.",
  "sinks": "File system (writing binary data), response data parsing into models or primitives, header manipulations, response object returns, response stream iteration.",
  "flows": "Response data flows from `httpx.Response` into parsing functions, stream generators, or file writers; headers influence response behavior; wrapper functions modify request headers and response handling; response parsing may lead to model instantiation or raw data return.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or covert malicious code detected. Response wrappers and header manipulations are standard for flexible HTTP client libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard HTTP response handling library supporting sync/async, streaming, parsing, and response wrapping. It uses common libraries (`httpx`, `pydantic`) and patterns typical in HTTP client implementations. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident. File operations are performed with safe practices. Response wrapping functions modify headers to control response behavior but are standard techniques. The overall design emphasizes correctness, flexibility, and resource safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-designed HTTP response management library with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The minimal security risk score reflects potential misuse in response handling or file operations, which are common in such libraries but do not indicate malicious activity.",
