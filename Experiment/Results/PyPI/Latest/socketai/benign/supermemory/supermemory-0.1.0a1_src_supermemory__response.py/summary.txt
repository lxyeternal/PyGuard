  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-designed HTTP response management library with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The minimal security risk score reflects potential misuse in response handling or file operations, which are common in such libraries but do not indicate malicious activity."
