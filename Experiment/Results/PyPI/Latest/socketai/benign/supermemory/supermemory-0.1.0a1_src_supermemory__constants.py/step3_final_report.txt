  "purpose": "Configuration setup for an HTTP client using the httpx library, defining constants for headers, timeouts, retries, and connection limits.",
  "sources": "Constants defining headers, timeouts, retries, and connection limits; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration without data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining constants for HTTP client configuration. It contains no dynamic input, network requests, or data processing. All reports correctly identify the code as benign setup code with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's static and standard nature. Confidence is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration code for an HTTP client, with no security concerns or malicious intent. The current assessment and scores are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
