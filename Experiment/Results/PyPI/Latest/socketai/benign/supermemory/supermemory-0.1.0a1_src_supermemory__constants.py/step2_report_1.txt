  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code defines constants for headers, timeouts, retries, and connection limits. No malicious code, anomalies, or suspicious patterns are present.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is purely configuration, with no data flow or untrusted input. The confidence is high, and the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero.  \n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard setup without network actions or data processing.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is straightforward configuration.  \n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, standard constants and no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign setup code.  \n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern—configuration constants, no anomalies.  \n- **Assessment:** Valid. No malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports—standard setup, no dynamic input or suspicious code.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.  \n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify the code as not obfuscated.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the code is purely configuration with no data handling, no network actions, and no external inputs, the risk score should be very low, close to zero.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code provided.\n- No evidence suggests any malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for the minimal potential if future modifications introduce risks, but currently negligible)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign configuration setup for an HTTP client, with no security concerns. The current scoring is justified.",
