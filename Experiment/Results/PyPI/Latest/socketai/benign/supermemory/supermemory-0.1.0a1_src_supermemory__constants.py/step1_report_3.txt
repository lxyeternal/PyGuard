  "purpose": "Define constants and default settings for HTTP client configuration, including headers, timeout, retries, and connection limits.",
  "sources": "Constants defining headers, timeout, retries, and connection limits; imported httpx module.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no direct untrusted data handling or data leaks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only sets static configuration variables without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the httpx library and defines several configuration constants for HTTP requests, such as header names, timeout durations, retry counts, and connection limits. These are standard practices for setting up an HTTP client and do not involve any dynamic or untrusted input processing. No sensitive data, environment variables, or user input handling is observed. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or covert operations in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration setup for an HTTP client using the httpx library. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears legitimate and intended for standard API request handling.",
