  "purpose": "Define constants and default settings for HTTP client configuration used in an OpenAPI-generated Python client.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; constants are hardcoded and static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data outputs; configuration parameters are static.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets default values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; straightforward configuration setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports httpx, a common HTTP client library, and sets various constants for headers, timeout, retries, and connection limits. These are standard parameters for network communication and do not involve dynamic or untrusted input handling. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be boilerplate setup for an HTTP client with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration snippet for setting up an HTTP client with default parameters. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is standard and benign.",
