  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is mainly type annotations, data structures, and protocols for an HTTP client library. No untrusted data processing, no network activity, no suspicious logic.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, justified by the absence of active logic or data handling.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type definitions and protocols. No data processing or network calls.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Static type definitions, protocols, no runtime logic or data handling, no external input processing.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Clearly safe, standard code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on type safety and protocols, no active data flow or network activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Again, type definitions and protocols, no runtime logic or data processing.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports indicate no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The code is purely type and protocol definitions for an HTTP client library.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Risk scores:** The initial risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the static nature of the code.\n- **Malware scores:** Consistently 0, matching the analysis.\n\n### Final Justification:\nThe code snippets are standard type annotations, class definitions, and protocol interfaces typical of a well-structured Python HTTP client library. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external data handling that could be exploited.\n\n### My Overall Estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, justified by the lack of active logic but acknowledging the potential for future extensions.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, well-structured, and free of malicious content. No further action or suspicion is warranted based on this static analysis.",
