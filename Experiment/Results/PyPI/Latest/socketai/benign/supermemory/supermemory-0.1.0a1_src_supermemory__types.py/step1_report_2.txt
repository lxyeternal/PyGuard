{
  "purpose": "The code defines type aliases, protocols, classes, and utility functions for handling HTTP requests, file uploads, and data models within a Python HTTP client library, likely for use with httpx.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (httpx, pydantic, typing), type definitions, class and function definitions, and constants.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no code writes or transmits data beyond defining types and classes.",
  "flows": "No active data flow; this code primarily defines types and protocols without runtime data handling or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type definitions, protocols, classes, and constants used to support a robust HTTP client interface. It includes support for file uploads, response handling, and request options, with no runtime logic or data processing that could be malicious. The imports and type annotations are standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or backdoors. All elements appear to be legitimate support code for a client library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for an HTTP client library with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It primarily defines types and protocols for safe, structured HTTP interactions. No security risks or malware detected.",
