  "purpose": "This code defines types, protocols, and utility classes for handling HTTP requests and data models in a Python HTTP client library, likely for use with httpx.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party modules (httpx, pydantic), and local module references.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks or malicious effects. No direct network operations, file writes, or command executions present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily establishes type definitions and protocols; no active data flows, network calls, or untrusted data processing are observable within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected. The code is predominantly type definitions, protocol interfaces, and helper classes, with no executable logic or side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type aliases, protocols, and data structures for a larger HTTP client framework. No execution logic, data processing, or I/O operations are present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms are identified. The code adheres to standard Python typing and protocol patterns without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of type definitions and protocols for an HTTP client library. There are no indications of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks within this code fragment.",
