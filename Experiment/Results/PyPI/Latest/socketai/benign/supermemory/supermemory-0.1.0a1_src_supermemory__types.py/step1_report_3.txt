{
  "purpose": "This code provides type definitions, imports, and protocol interfaces for an HTTP client library built around httpx, mainly for request configuration, data handling, and type safety.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type annotations, imported modules, and class/method definitions. No user input or untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks processing untrusted data, no network calls, no external data handling, and no operations that could leak or manipulate user data.",
  "flows": "The code primarily defines types and protocols without runtime data flow logic; no source-to-sink data flow is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be straightforward type and protocol definitions for an HTTP client library.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists of static type definitions, import statements, class and protocol declarations, and type aliases, with no runtime data handling or network activity. It does not process external input or perform any actions that could be exploited maliciously. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code's purpose is to set up types and protocols for a larger HTTP client system, and it appears to be well-structured, standard, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions and protocol interfaces for an HTTP client library. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. It appears safe and intended for type safety and clarity within a larger project.",
