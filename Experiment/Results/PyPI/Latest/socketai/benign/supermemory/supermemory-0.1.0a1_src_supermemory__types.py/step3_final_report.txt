{
  "purpose": "The code provides static type annotations, protocol definitions, data structures, and constants for an HTTP client library built around httpx, with no runtime logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class definitions, and protocol methods that do not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code defines types and protocols without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type aliases, protocol classes, data structures, and constants intended for an HTTP client library. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or runtime logic. All reports agree that the code is static, free of obfuscation, and lacks malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the static and non-executable nature of the code. The high confidence scores are justified given the static analysis. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations and protocols for an HTTP client library, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its static, non-executable nature. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
