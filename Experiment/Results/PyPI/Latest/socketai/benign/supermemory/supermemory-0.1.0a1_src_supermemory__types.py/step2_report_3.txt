  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, logical flaws, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is primarily type annotations, data structures, and protocol classes for an HTTP client library. No external input, no network activity, no data leaks, or suspicious logic are identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.1) seems reasonable given the code's nature. The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. The confidence is high (0.95). No issues detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on type definitions and protocols. No runtime logic or untrusted data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The zero scores for malware and obfuscated code are justified. The security risk is zero, consistent with the code's static nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, static type definitions and protocols with no runtime or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The high confidence (1.0) is justified. No issues with the scores.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focused on static type definitions and protocols, no malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The assessment and scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, no runtime logic, no untrusted data processing, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The scores and confidence are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** The minimal risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.1) are justified considering the code is purely type definitions and protocols with no runtime or external data handling.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 (from Report 1) — considering the code's static, non-executable nature, this is acceptable.\n\n**Note:** The scores are consistent and justified. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the code's benign nature. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of type annotations and protocols for an HTTP client library, with no malicious or obfuscated content detected.",
