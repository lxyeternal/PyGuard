{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for parsing and serializing URL query strings with support for different array and nested formats.",
  "sources": "Input query string in parse method; parameters in stringify and stringify_items methods; data in _stringify_item method from params and nested structures.",
  "sinks": "Return value of parse method (parsed query parameters); output of stringify and stringify_items methods (URL-encoded strings); internal _stringify_item method that converts data to string.",
  "flows": "Input query string -> parse method -> parsed data (safe); parameters -> stringify / stringify_items -> URL-encoded string; nested structures processed through _stringify_item -> flattened into key-value pairs for encoding.",
  "anomalies": "Use of _primitive_value_to_str converts various data types into strings, including booleans and None; no evident insecure handling of data. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors present. Use of NotImplementedError for unsupported formats; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of query string parsing and serialization. It handles nested data structures, different array formats, and primitive types. No user input is directly executed or executed as code. No data leakage, network communication, or malicious actions are present. The only potential concern is that unsupported formats raise exceptions, but this is standard for such implementations. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors identified. The logic for converting values to strings is benign and does not involve security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for handling query strings with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The implementation appears correct and safe.",
