{
  "purpose": "Provides URL query string parsing and serialization with customizable array and nested formats.",
  "sources": "Input strings to parse(), parameters to stringify() and stringify_items()",
  "sinks": "Uses standard library functions parse_qs and urlencode for URL encoding/decoding",
  "flows": "Input query string -> parse_qs; Params -> urlencode -> output string; Params -> _stringify_item -> flatten",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or external network activity; uses standard safe libraries",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for URL query string handling, relying on standard Python libraries and internal utilities assumed safe. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The minimal security risk stems from inherent URL encoding concerns, not from code flaws. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscation score 0, and security risk score 0.1 reflects inherent URL handling risks, justified by the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for URL query string parsing and serialization with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
