{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for parsing and serializing URL query strings, including handling nested data structures and various array formats.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function parameters such as 'query' (string input), 'params' (mapping of data), and internal variables like 'value' during serialization.",
  "sinks": "The code serializes data into URL-encoded strings via 'urlencode' and 'flatten', and parses query strings with 'parse_qs'. These are standard library functions, not sinks for untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Input data (query string or parameters) flows through parsing or serialization functions, which generate URL-encoded strings. No data flows into system commands or network connections.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code uses standard libraries and safe data handling practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions to handle URL query string parsing and serialization. It includes multiple methods to convert data structures into URL-encoded strings with configurable formats. There are no signs of malicious code such as code injection, data theft, or network communication. The use of 'urlencode' and 'parse_qs' is standard and safe. The only potential concern is that the code handles data serialization/deserialization, but this is a typical operation and does not involve executing untrusted code or malicious behaviors. There are no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign utility for URL query string handling with no malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, uses safe practices, and does not contain any malware or suspicious anomalies.",
