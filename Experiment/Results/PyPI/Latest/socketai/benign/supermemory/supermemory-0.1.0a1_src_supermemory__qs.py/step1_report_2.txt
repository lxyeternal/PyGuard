{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for parsing and serializing URL query strings with customizable formats for arrays and nested objects.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from method parameters such as 'query' string in 'parse' and 'params' in 'stringify' methods.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the 'urlencode' function, which constructs URL query strings from data. No other external or system sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input query string -> parse_qs (parsing); Params data -> _stringify_item (serialization) -> urlencode -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or dynamic code execution. The code only manipulates data structures and strings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for managing query string parsing and serialization with configurable formats. It uses standard Python libraries like urllib.parse without any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external resource access. No hardcoded credentials, no data leaks, and no malicious activities are apparent. The use of 'flatten' and custom options is controlled and limited to data formatting. The code structure is clear, and the logic focuses solely on URL encoding/decoding tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for handling URL query parameters with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware or security flaws based on the provided content.",
