{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for handling API errors, encapsulating request and response data from 'httpx' for debugging and error reporting.",
  "sources": "Reads class definitions, exception initializers, and 'httpx' Request and Response objects.",
  "sinks": "Stores request, response, message, and body data within exception instances; no external data leaks or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Error classes are instantiated with request/response objects; no dynamic or unsafe data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of exception classes for API error handling, relying on 'httpx'. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, data manipulation, or network operations beyond encapsulating error details. The consistent absence of obfuscation, malicious patterns, or data leaks indicates benign intent. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1) are aligned with the code's nature and the detailed reviews. No evidence suggests malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of API error classes with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content and analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
