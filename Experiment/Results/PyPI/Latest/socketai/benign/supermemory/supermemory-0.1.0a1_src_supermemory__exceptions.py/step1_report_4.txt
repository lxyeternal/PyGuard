  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various API error responses and connection issues.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ and typing_extensions, class definitions, and exception initializers.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted input or perform data output.",
  "flows": "Exception constructors assign request and response objects to class attributes, but no untrusted data is used in security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of exception classes for API error handling, utilizing the httpx library. It employs standard Python class inheritance and type annotations. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. No data leaks, code injection points, or malicious behavior detected. All classes are for error handling, with no external input processing or sensitive operations. The code appears to be part of a client library for API communication, with proper error encapsulation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical error handling module for an API client, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured and does not perform any suspicious activities.",
