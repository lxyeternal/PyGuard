{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling various API error responses, facilitating error management in a Python application that interacts with an HTTP API.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'httpx' library's Request and Response objects, and from the constructor parameters for the exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the raising and handling of exceptions which may process or log error details, but no malicious data flows or unsafe operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the API responses or request objects into exception instances, which are then used to handle error scenarios; no untrusted data is processed in a harmful way.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard exception class definitions for API error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'httpx' and defines various custom exception classes inheriting from a base error class. These classes encapsulate information about API errors, including request and response data, and assign specific HTTP status codes for common errors. The implementation uses straightforward inheritance, type annotations, and clear documentation. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious logic. The use of 'httpx' objects is limited to data encapsulation, with no unsafe operations or data leaks evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of API error handling classes with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a structured way to manage API errors within a Python application. Overall, it is safe and does not pose security threats.",
