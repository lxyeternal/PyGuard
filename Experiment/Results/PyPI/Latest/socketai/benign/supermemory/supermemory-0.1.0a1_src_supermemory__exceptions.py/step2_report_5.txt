  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a standard, straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling.\n- They emphasize that the code only encapsulates request and response objects from 'httpx' and does not perform any dangerous operations, dynamic code execution, or data manipulation.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The malware score across reports is consistently 0.\n- The security risk scores are very low (0.1), reflecting minimal concern, mainly due to potential data leak points (storing request/response objects and error messages), but no actual vulnerabilities are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- It is a standard error handling module, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.\n- The data flows are limited to error encapsulation; no untrusted data is processed insecurely or written to external systems.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are apparent.\n- The code correctly assigns status codes and encapsulates request/response data.\n- No issues with the use of 'httpx' or the exception hierarchy.\n\n### Score Reasonableness:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 is reasonable, considering the potential for data leaks but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The low security risk score is justified because, while the code stores request and response objects, it does not process or leak sensitive data maliciously.\n- The malware score remains at 0 because there is no indication of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0, given the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n\n### Potential Claims and Assumptions:\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as standard.\n- No suspicious patterns or assumptions are made about malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Overall, the code is a standard, well-structured set of API error classes with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.** The current scores are appropriate.\n\n**My personal estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports, given potential data leak points but no actual risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, non-malicious, and suitable for its purpose.",
