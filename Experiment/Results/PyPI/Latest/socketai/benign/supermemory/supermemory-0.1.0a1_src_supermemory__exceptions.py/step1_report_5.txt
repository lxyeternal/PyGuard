  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling API errors and HTTP response status codes.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (__future__, typing_extensions), third-party library (httpx), and class definitions with attributes and initializers.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes to external systems, outputs, or performs network operations. It mainly handles errors and exceptions.",
  "flows": "Error handling flows are confined within exception classes, passing data between constructors and superclasses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The classes and structure follow standard error handling conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for API error handling, including specific status code exceptions. It relies on httpx objects for request and response data. No data is read from or written to external sources outside of these classes. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or malicious patterns are observed. The code appears to be a typical error handling module with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This module serves as a structured exception framework for API error responses, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is well-structured and contains no suspicious or harmful code.",
