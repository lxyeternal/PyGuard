{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling API errors and responses in an HTTP client context, likely for a Python package interacting with an API.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, exception initializers, and imported modules such as 'httpx' and 'typing_extensions'.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points include storing request and response objects and error messages; no untrusted data is directly written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Errors are raised with API response objects and request data; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks that perform dangerous actions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and standard for error handling; no unusual or suspicious code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes for API error handling, utilizing data from 'httpx' request and response objects. No input/output handling, no dynamic code execution, and no data manipulation that could indicate malicious intent. The structure is typical for client-side API error management, with clear separation of error types based on HTTP status codes. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of API error classes for a Python HTTP client. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is unlikely to be harmful or malicious.",
