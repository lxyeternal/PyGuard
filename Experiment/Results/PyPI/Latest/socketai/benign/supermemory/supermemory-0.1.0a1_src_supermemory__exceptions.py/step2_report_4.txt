  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines API error classes.\n- Source: Reads class definitions, exception initializers, 'httpx'.\n- Sinks: Stores request/response/error messages; no external data leaks.\n- Flows: Errors created with request/response data; no untrusted data processed maliciously.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, secrets.\n- Analysis: Standard error classes, no malicious behavior, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Safe, normal API error handling code.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (minimal, typical for error handling code)\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard structure and no malicious patterns.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion: straightforward exception classes, no malicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Consistent with prior findings: standard error classes, no suspicious code.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern: well-structured, no malicious intent.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm the code is a set of exception classes for API error handling, using 'httpx'.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; typical error handling code with minimal exposure.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** Given the minimal security risk (0.1) and the nature of the code, a risk score of **0.1** remains appropriate.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code does not process untrusted data in a dangerous way.\n- No data leaks, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- The structure is typical for client libraries interacting with APIs.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of API error classes with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores are reasonable and should remain as is.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the code's benign nature and low security risk.",
