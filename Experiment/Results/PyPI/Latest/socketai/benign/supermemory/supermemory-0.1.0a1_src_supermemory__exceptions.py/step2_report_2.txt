  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the provided scores.\n\n**Summary of the code:**  \nThe code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for handling API errors in a Python HTTP client context, relying on the 'httpx' library. It encapsulates request and response data within exceptions for debugging or error reporting, with specific classes for common HTTP error statuses.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues\n- The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to standard practices for API error handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- No external data leaks or unsafe operations are evident.\n- The exception classes only store and propagate error information; they do not perform any dangerous actions.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of API error classes, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Scores and Reasoning\n\n#### Malware Score\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis that there's no malicious behavior.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious code snippets.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score\n- All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is consistent given the code's clarity.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n#### Security Risk Score\n- The reports assign a low risk score (~0.1), citing potential data leaks through stored request/response objects but emphasizing that no untrusted data is processed insecurely.\n- Given the code's purpose and implementation, this is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Points of Attention\n- The code is primarily for error encapsulation, with no dynamic code execution, data manipulation, or network operations beyond exception creation.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on actual code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n**Based on all reports and the code review, my estimates are:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (No malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (Code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** (Minimal, mainly due to potential data exposure in error objects, but no actual security flaw)\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security threat.**",
