  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the validity of their conclusions, especially regarding malware, obfuscation, and security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines standard API error classes, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n- **Findings:** The code is straightforward, using 'httpx' objects to encapsulate request/response data, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is typical for API error handling, with no evidence of malicious activity. The low security risk score seems appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of the exception classes, no malicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic code, no data leaks, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code remains standard, and the conclusion that it is safe is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard error class definitions, with no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Findings:** No obfuscation, no malicious code, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code content. The risk score is even lower here, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard API error handling classes, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No external data processing or unsafe operations.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. The code appears benign and typical for its purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard exception classes, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No obfuscation, no malicious behavior, no data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the previous reports. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is straightforward, defining exception classes for API error handling. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. There is no evidence of malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1 or 0), reflecting minimal security concern due to error handling logic, which is standard and safe.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a typical, well-structured set of exception classes used in API clients. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very low, standard error handling code)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the assessments in the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and free from malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
