  "purpose": "Metadata declaration for the Python package 'supermemory', likely used for package identification and versioning.",
  "sources": "Constants '__title__' and '__version__' definitions, which are hardcoded string assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the code only assigns static string values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and typical for package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of metadata variables defining the package title and version. No input reading, no data processing, and no suspicious or malicious code present. The structure and content are typical for package metadata files generated from an API spec. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard metadata snippet with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
