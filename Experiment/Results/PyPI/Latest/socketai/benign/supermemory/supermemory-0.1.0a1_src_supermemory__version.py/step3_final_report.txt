  "purpose": "The code defines static package metadata variables (__title__, __version__) for the 'supermemory' package, generated from an OpenAPI spec.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static variable assignments",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external interactions",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignments only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, generated, and static",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments for package metadata, with no input, output, or external interactions. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code is generated from an OpenAPI spec, which is standard. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero, consistent with the benign nature. The confidence level is high, as the analysis is based on static inspection. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
