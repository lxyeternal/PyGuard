  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple, static variable assignments for package metadata (__title__, __version__).\n- No input, output, data flows, or external interactions are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The code appears to be auto-generated from an OpenAPI spec, which is standard practice.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code snippets provided match the descriptions: they are just static string assignments.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n**Analysis of scoring:**\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's content.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, reflecting high certainty that these are benign metadata definitions.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- Since all reports are consistent and describe the same benign pattern, there's no basis to suspect hidden malicious intent.\n- The code is standard for package metadata and contains no dynamic or suspicious elements.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Given the uniformity and the nature of the code, I agree with the current scores.\n- I would not elevate the malware or security risk scores.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0, as there's no sign of obfuscation.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
