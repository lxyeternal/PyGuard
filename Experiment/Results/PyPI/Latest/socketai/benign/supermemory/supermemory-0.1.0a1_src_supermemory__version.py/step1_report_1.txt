  "purpose": "Metadata assignment for a Python package, specifying the package name and version.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of string values to variables; no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink as the code only assigns static strings to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected in the given code.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, setting package metadata variables. It does not process data, execute dynamic code, or perform any operations that could be malicious. There are no input sources, sinks, or data flows. The code is standard for Python package metadata files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as package metadata with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
