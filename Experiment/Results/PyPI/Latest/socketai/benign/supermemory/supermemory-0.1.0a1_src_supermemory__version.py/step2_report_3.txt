  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of static string assignments for package metadata (__title__, __version__).\n   - No input reading, data processing, external system interaction, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - The code is generated from an OpenAPI spec, likely via Stainless, which is a standard code generation tool.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No report indicates any suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n   - The code is straightforward and typical for package metadata files.\n   - No signs of malware, hidden code, or obfuscated logic.\n\n3. **Risk & Malware Scores**:\n   - All reports assign a risk score and malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Any Logical Flaws or Inconsistencies**:\n   - The reports are consistent and correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No report suggests any assumptions that could be challenged or any overlooked malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Scores Justification**:\n   - Since the code is purely static metadata, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should all be zero.\n   - The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned are accurate and reasonable.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a standard, auto-generated package metadata file with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are thorough and accurate.",
