  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \nAll reports describe the code as simple static assignments of package metadata variables (__title__, __version__). There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors. The code is straightforward and generated from an OpenAPI spec, which is typical for such files.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**  \nNone of the reports identify any anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code does not perform any operations beyond defining static strings, which is standard for package metadata.\n\n3. **Scores & Reasonableness**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, non-obfuscated code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All are 0, correctly reflecting the absence of security issues.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Logical Errors**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll claims are based on the code's static, straightforward nature. No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n6. **Scores Justification & Recommendations**  \n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n- Since the code is purely declarative, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, standard package metadata with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concern signals. The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign, metadata-only nature of the code.\n\n**Note:** If future code includes dynamic behaviors, external data handling, or suspicious patterns, reassessment would be necessary.",
