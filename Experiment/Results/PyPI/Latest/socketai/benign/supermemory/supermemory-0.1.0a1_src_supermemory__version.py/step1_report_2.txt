  "purpose": "Metadata definition for the 'supermemory' Python package, including title and version information.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting __title__ and __version__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as only static variable assignments are present.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies, suspicious behavior, or obfuscated constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines package metadata variables (__title__, __version__) with static string values. There is no input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external data sources or sinks. The code appears to be auto-generated from an OpenAPI spec, which is typical and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only static metadata variable assignments with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is a standard header for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
