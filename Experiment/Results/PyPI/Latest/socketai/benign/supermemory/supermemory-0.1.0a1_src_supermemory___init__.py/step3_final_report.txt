{
  "purpose": "Standard package setup and initialization, importing modules, defining constants, and configuring error handling and logging.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules, setting __module__ attributes, and setup functions.",
  "sinks": "No data flow to external systems, no network or file operations, no untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "Initialization code runs at import time; no runtime data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Reassignment of __module__ attribute for multiple symbols, which is unusual but benign and often used for error message clarity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package setup script with imports, constants, error class definitions, and a loop modifying __module__ attributes. These modifications are unconventional but not malicious; they do not involve data leaks, network activity, or obfuscation. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with the slight risk increase justified by the unusual attribute reassignment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard, and contains no signs of malware or security risks. The minor modification of __module__ attributes is benign and likely for internal error message clarity. Overall, the package initialization code is trustworthy.",
