{
  "purpose": "The code defines and exports components of a Python package, including imports, constants, error classes, and utility functions, to facilitate API client functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules, internal functions, and constants; setup_logging call at the end.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily imports, sets up, and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard package setup tasks; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. The __module__ attribute reassignment is benign in context of package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various internal modules and components, sets up logging, and adjusts the __module__ attribute for exported symbols to improve error message clarity. All actions are standard package setup procedures. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code present. No network, file, or sensitive data handling observed. The __module__ attribute change is benign and common for internal package organization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization and export script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and legitimate in its purpose to organize package components.",
