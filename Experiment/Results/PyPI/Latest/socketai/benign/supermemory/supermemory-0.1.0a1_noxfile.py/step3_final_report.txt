{
  "purpose": "This code defines a nox session to install dependencies from a lock file, install a specific version of pydantic, and run pytest with custom arguments, serving as a testing automation script.",
  "sources": "Reads dependencies from 'requirements-dev.lock', installs 'pydantic<2', and accepts session arguments for pytest execution.",
  "sinks": "Executes 'pytest' command which runs test code; no untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Dependency installation flows into test execution via 'session.run', with no external data or network activity involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical nox configuration for testing, involving dependency installation and test execution. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behaviors are present. The dependency lock file and version constraints are standard practices. No anomalies or security issues are evident. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign testing setup with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
