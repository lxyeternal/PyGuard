  "purpose": "Define a nox session for testing pydantic version less than 2 with specific requirements.",
  "sources": "requirements-dev.lock file for dependencies, nox script parameters for session configuration",
  "sinks": "Running pytest with arguments; potential execution of untrusted code during tests",
  "flows": "Dependencies are installed from requirements-dev.lock and pydantic<2, then pytest is run with specified arguments",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed. Usage appears standard for a testing setup.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a nox session named 'test-pydantic-v1' that installs dependencies from a requirements lock file and a specific version constraint for pydantic. It then runs pytest with certain flags. No indications of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity. The script appears to be a standard testing automation configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical testing setup without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It manages dependencies and executes tests in a controlled environment.",
