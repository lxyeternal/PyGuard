  "purpose": "Defines a nox session for testing a Python project with specific dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'requirements-dev.lock' file during 'session.install' calls.",
  "sinks": "Runs 'pytest' command with passed arguments.",
  "flows": "Installs dependencies from 'requirements-dev.lock' and 'pydantic<2', then executes pytest with specific options.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Usage of nox and pytest appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code uses nox to manage testing sessions, installing dependencies from a lockfile and a specific package version. It then runs pytest with certain flags. No data is sent over the network, no sensitive information is accessed or leaked, and no unusual code patterns are present. The dependencies are typical for testing environments. The code does not perform any obfuscated or malicious activities. The overall structure and content appear standard and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical test setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages dependencies and runs tests using nox and pytest.",
