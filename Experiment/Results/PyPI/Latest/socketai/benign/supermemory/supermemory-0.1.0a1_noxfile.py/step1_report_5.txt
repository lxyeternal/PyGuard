  "purpose": "Defines a nox session to run tests with specific dependencies and configurations",
  "sources": "Requirement file 'requirements-dev.lock', function arguments, and the code itself",
  "sinks": "session.install commands and session.run command potentially executing external code or dependencies",
  "flows": "requirements file and install commands provide dependencies, then pytest is executed with specific arguments",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected; straightforward test setup",
  "analysis": "The code defines a nox session for testing Python code with specified dependencies. It installs dependencies from a lockfile and a specific version of pydantic, then runs pytest with options. There are no suspicious commands, no dynamic code execution, or external network activity within this snippet. The use of nox and explicit dependencies suggests a standard test environment setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard test setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It performs typical dependency installation and test execution steps.",
