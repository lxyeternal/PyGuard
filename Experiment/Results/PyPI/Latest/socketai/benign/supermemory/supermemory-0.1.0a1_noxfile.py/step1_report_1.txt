  "purpose": "Defines a nox session to install dependencies and run pytest for testing pydantic v1.",
  "sources": "Reads requirements from 'requirements-dev.lock' and installs specific pydantic version.",
  "sinks": "Executes pytest command with provided arguments.",
  "flows": "Installs dependencies from a lock file and runs pytest with specified arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. Uses standard nox session configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a nox session to automate testing. It installs dependencies from a lock file, which is a common practice for reproducible environments, and installs a specific version of pydantic. It then runs pytest with certain arguments. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is observed. The code appears straightforward, primarily automating testing procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard automation for testing a Python project with no apparent malicious intent or security risks.",
