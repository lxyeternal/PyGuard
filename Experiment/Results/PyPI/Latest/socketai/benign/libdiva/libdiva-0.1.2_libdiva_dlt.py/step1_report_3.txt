{
  "purpose": "Provide classes to read from and write to DLT files, managing file contents and entries.",
  "sources": "File paths specified during class initialization and method calls, reading from and writing to the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations that output user-added entries to disk.",
  "flows": "Reading data from files into memory, and writing user-provided entries from memory to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes, DLTReader and DLTWriter, which handle reading from and writing to files. The reading method simply loads file content into memory; the writing method outputs user-supplied entries to a file. Both operations use standard file I/O with specified encoding. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code appears straightforward and intended solely for file handling. No suspicious or anomalous behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of file read/write classes with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages file I/O for DLT files and does not include any harmful or malicious behavior.",
