{
  "purpose": "To read from and write to DLT files, likely for data logging or processing.",
  "sources": "File paths provided during object initialization; reading from the file system.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations; writing user data or processed contents to specified files.",
  "flows": "File content read during 'read()' to 'contents' attribute; 'add_entry()' appends data to entries; 'write()' writes entries to file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual code patterns observed. No external data input besides file I/O.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes for file operations: reading and writing DLT files. The 'read()' method reads file contents; 'print_contents()' displays them. The 'write()' method writes user-provided entries to a file. All operations are straightforward file I/O. No input sanitization or security mechanisms are implemented, but given the context, this is standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The code appears purely for file handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic file read/write operations with no evident malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. Overall risk is minimal.",
