  "purpose": "Classes for reading and writing DLT files with standard file I/O operations.",
  "sources": "File path provided during class initialization, file read/write functions.",
  "sinks": "Printing contents to terminal, writing entries to file.",
  "flows": "Reading file content into memory, printing it, appending entries, writing entries back to file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file reading and writing with no dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscation. It handles input via file paths and entries, with outputs to console and files. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The data flow is limited to local file operations and printing, with no external data exfiltration or code injection. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns justify a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of file I/O classes for DLT files. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
