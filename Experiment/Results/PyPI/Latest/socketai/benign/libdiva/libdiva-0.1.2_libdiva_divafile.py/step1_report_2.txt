{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions to encrypt and decrypt files using AES encryption in ECB mode, specifically for files identified as DIVAFILE format.",
  "sources": "File input read in 'encrypt_divafile' and 'decrypt_divafile' functions; file paths used to generate output files.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted data written to output files; decrypted data written back to disk; print statements for debugging info.",
  "flows": "Reads file data, pads and encrypts it (encrypt_divafile), then writes header and encrypted payload to a new file; reads encrypted file, verifies magic header, decrypts payload, and writes decrypted data to a new file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ECB mode which is insecure; hardcoded key 'file access deny'; print statements reveal internal sizes; no input validation or sanitization; simplistic padding scheme.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward encryption/decryption pipeline for files with minimal obfuscation or concealment. The use of ECB mode is a known security flaw, but not malicious by itself. The hardcoded key is a security concern, as it is static and embedded in code, but does not indicate malicious intent. The print statements could leak sensitive information if logs are accessible, but are not inherently malicious. No evidence of backdoors, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. Overall, the code does not contain malicious behavior but has security weaknesses that should be addressed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic implementation of file encryption/decryption with security weaknesses such as static keys and insecure mode. There is no malicious behavior or sabotage detected. The primary concern is security best practices, not malicious intent.",
