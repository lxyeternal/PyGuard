  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the issues, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's function.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; files are read and written, debug info via print statements.\n- **Anomalies:** Correctly identifies use of ECB mode, fixed key, and debug print statements as security weaknesses, not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately notes security flaws but no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct, no malicious behavior)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.4 (moderate, due to security flaws)  \n  - Confidence: 0.8 (reasonable)\n\n**Verdict:** The report is consistent and reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with slight variation in language and confidence.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Correctly highlights ECB mode, static key, print statements, and security concerns.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (no malicious activity)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.3 (slightly lower, but still significant)  \n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent, accurate, no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar observations: ECB mode, hardcoded key, insecure padding, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.6 (higher, reflecting increased security concern)  \n  - Confidence: 0.8\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same pattern: insecure cryptography, static key, no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.4 (moderate)  \n  - Confidence: 0.8\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar analysis, with no indication of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.4  \n  - Confidence: 0.8\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation observed.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports acknowledge insecure cryptography but no malicious intent. The scores are generally between 0.3 and 0.6, which is appropriate given the security flaws.\n\n### My Overall Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malware observed or implied)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** Considering the repeated insecure cryptography (ECB mode, static key, poor padding), I would assign a **risk score around 0.6**. The code does not appear malicious but has significant security flaws that could be exploited or lead to vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No evidence of malicious intent or malware.\n- The primary concern is insecure cryptography practices, which are well-acknowledged in the reports.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.6\n\nThe scores in the reports are reasonable, but I would slightly elevate the overall risk to 0.6 to reflect the insecure cryptographic practices more strongly.",
