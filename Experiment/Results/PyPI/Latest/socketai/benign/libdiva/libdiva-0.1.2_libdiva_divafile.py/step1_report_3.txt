{
  "purpose": "Provides encryption and decryption functionality for files using AES in ECB mode, specifically designed for DIVAFILE format.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from specified file path; reads encrypted data from file during decryption.",
  "sinks": "Writes encrypted/decrypted data back to disk; outputs file paths.",
  "flows": "Reads file input -> encrypts/decrypts data -> writes output file, with headers indicating payload and plaintext sizes.",
  "anomalies": "Uses ECB mode, which is insecure; hardcoded key and magic bytes; minimal data validation; no input sanitization or secure key management.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file encryption/decryption with fixed key and magic header. It pads data with null bytes and uses ECB mode, which is vulnerable to pattern leaks and cryptanalysis. No user input validation or secret management is present, but there are no indications of backdoors or malicious code. The logging statements could potentially leak sensitive information in some contexts, but they are general info logs here. No obfuscated code or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The module provides basic encryption/decryption functionalities with insecure cryptographic mode and hardcoded keys. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malware, but the insecure design presents security risks. No malicious behavior observed, but the security practices are weak.",
