{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for encrypting and decrypting files using AES in ECB mode with a fixed key, adding a custom header with magic bytes and payload lengths.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from files during encryption and reads entire encrypted files during decryption.",
  "sinks": "Writes encrypted/decrypted data to output files; debug print statements leak internal info.",
  "flows": "Input file data is padded and encrypted, then combined with header and written to output; during decryption, header is read, data is decrypted, and output file is written.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ECB mode with a static key, debug print statements revealing internal info, minimal validation, no integrity checks, fixed header structure.",
  "analysis": "The code employs insecure cryptographic practices such as ECB mode and a hardcoded key, which are security flaws but do not indicate malicious intent. It reads and writes files straightforwardly, with no network activity or obfuscation. The debug print statements and lack of validation could lead to information leakage or vulnerabilities but are not malicious. The overall structure is simple and clear, with no signs of sabotage or covert channels.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign but suffers from significant security weaknesses due to insecure cryptography and lack of validation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The security risk is moderate, but the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero.",
