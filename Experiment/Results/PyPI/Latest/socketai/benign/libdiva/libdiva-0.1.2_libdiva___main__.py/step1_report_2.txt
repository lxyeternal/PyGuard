  "purpose": "A command-line utility for manipulating files specific to the Project Diva series, including encryption, decryption, extraction, and reading of custom file formats.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments (filepath, output_dir, options such as --encrypt, --decrypt, --extract, --read, --write, --entries).",
  "sinks": "File operations (encrypt_divafile, decrypt_divafile, DLTWriter, ExtractFARC), printing output, sys.exit() for error handling.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from command-line args to functions such as encrypt_divafile and decrypt_divafile, or file reading via DLTReader and ExtractFARC. Outputs are printed or files written based on user options.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. The code performs standard command-line parsing, file handling, and function calls based on user input. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution identified.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a CLI front end for various file manipulation routines tied to Project Diva files. It reads user input, dispatches to relevant functions, and handles files accordingly. The imported functions such as encrypt_divafile, decrypt_divafile, DLTReader, and ExtractFARC are assumed to be standard utility functions related to file processing, with no malicious intent apparent. The code does not include network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It performs expected file processing tasks securely and transparently.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward command-line tool for file manipulation with no malicious or suspicious behaviors detected. It relies on external libraries for core functionality, which appear to be standard file processing routines. No evidence of malware or security risks is present.",
