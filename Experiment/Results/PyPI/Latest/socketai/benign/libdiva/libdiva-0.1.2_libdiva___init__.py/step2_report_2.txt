  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the validity of the conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code snippet is a minimal module that imports specific functions and classes from the `libdiva` package and re-exports them via `__all__`.\n- There is no logic, control flow, or data processing in this snippet.\n- The functions imported (e.g., `encrypt_divafile`, `decrypt_divafile`, `ExtractFARC`) suggest file manipulation, encryption, and extraction, but their internal implementations are not visible here.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and that any security risks depend on the implementations within `libdiva`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Potential Issues:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior?**  \n  No. The code is a straightforward API surface exposing functions from `libdiva`.  \n  **Scores:** All reports correctly assign `malware: 0`.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No obfuscation is evident. All reports assign `obfuscated: 0`.\n\n- **Data flow or security risks?**  \n  The code only re-exports functions; actual data flows occur within those functions.  \n  The reports' low `securityRisk` scores (mostly 0.1 or 0.2) seem reasonable, considering potential risks in the imported functions, but nothing suspicious is visible here.\n\n---\n\n### Specific score review and justification:\n\n**Malware scores:**  \nAll reports assign `0`, which is appropriate given the code snippet. No malicious activity is detectable at this level.\n\n**Obfuscated scores:**  \nAll reports assign `0`, consistent with the code's clarity.\n\n**Risk scores:**  \nMost reports assign very low risk scores (0.1 or 0.2). Since the code is just an API surface, these are reasonable, assuming that the imported functions are safe or their maliciousness depends on their internal implementation.\n\n**Confidence levels:**  \nHigh confidence (mostly 0.9 or 1) is justified, as the code is simple and clear.\n\n---\n\n### Potential inconsistencies or issues:\n\n- **Any overestimation of risk?**  \n  No. The low scores align with the code's simplicity.\n\n- **Any underestimation?**  \n  Without internal implementation details, it’s impossible to definitively assess whether `encrypt_divafile` or `decrypt_divafile` could be malicious. However, based solely on this snippet, the risk appears minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The scores reflect the actual content accurately.\n- No anomalies, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident.\n- The security posture is very low risk based on this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, based on potential risks in imported functions, but no direct evidence here)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, and the scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and justified. The actual security depends on the implementation of the functions within `libdiva`, which are not visible here. For this snippet, no further action is necessary.",
