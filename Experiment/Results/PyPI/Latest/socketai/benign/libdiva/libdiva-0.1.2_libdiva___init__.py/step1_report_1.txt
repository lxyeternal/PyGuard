{
  "purpose": "To provide a library for manipulating files specific to the Project Diva series, including reading, writing, encryption, decryption, and extraction functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from the libdiva module, which may involve reading external files or data streams within the imported functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the functions encrypt_divafile and decrypt_divafile, which may process sensitive data, and ExtractFARC, which may handle file extraction. These could lead to data leaks if misused.",
  "flows": "Data can flow from external inputs into the imported functions (e.g., decrypt_divafile), and then possibly be written or extracted via the exported functions. However, specific data flow is not explicit in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward with simple imports and an exports list.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal library stub that re-exports specific functions from the libdiva package. It does not contain logic or control flow, only import statements and __all__ declarations. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident. The functions imported suggest file manipulation and encryption tasks, which are standard for such libraries. No anomalies or signs of malicious intent are detected in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign library interface exposing file manipulation functions related to Project Diva. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on this snippet.",
