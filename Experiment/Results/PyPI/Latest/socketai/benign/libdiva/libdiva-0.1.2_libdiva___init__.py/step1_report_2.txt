  "purpose": "Library for manipulating files specific to the Project Diva series",
  "sources": "Import statements from libdiva modules",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "Not explicitly present; only module imports and exports without data flow logic",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscation or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from the libdiva package and exposes them via __all__. No data processing, user input handling, or network operations is present. The imported functions like encrypt_divafile and decrypt_divafile could potentially manipulate sensitive data, but there is no evidence of misuse or malicious intent within this snippet. The code is straightforward, minimal, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple module exposing selected functions and classes from the libdiva package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks within this snippet.",
