{
  "purpose": "A library for manipulating files specific to the Project Diva series, providing interfaces for reading, writing, encrypting, decrypting, and extracting FARC files.",
  "sources": "Imports from libdiva modules: libdiva.dlt, libdiva.divafile, and libdiva.farc",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable operations present in this code snippet",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines imports and exports without runtime data flows or input processing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The functions imported could potentially be malicious in their own implementations, but from this code alone, no malicious activity is evident",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes from the libdiva package and declares them in __all__ for module exports. It appears to be a straightforward module interface definition with no execution logic, data handling, or external interactions. Without the implementation details of libdiva modules, no malicious behavior can be determined from this snippet. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple interface declaration for a file manipulation library related to Project Diva. There are no suspicious behaviors or malicious intent visible in this snippet. However, the actual security of the functions depends on the implementations within libdiva, which are not included here.",
