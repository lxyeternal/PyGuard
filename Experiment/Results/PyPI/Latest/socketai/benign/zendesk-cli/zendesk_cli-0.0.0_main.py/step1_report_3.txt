  "purpose": "Simple script that prints a greeting message.",
  "sources": "No input sources; no data read from external sources.",
  "sinks": "Uses print() function, which outputs to standard output.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or unusual code structures, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious imports or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: defines a main function that prints a message, then calls main() if the script is executed directly. There are no input reads, no data leaks, no network calls, or other potentially malicious behaviors. The structure and content are typical for a simple Python script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves a basic purpose of printing a message, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
