  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code simply executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic Python script that defines a main function to print a message. It then calls main() when executed directly. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious behavior. The code does not interact with the network, handle user input, or manipulate sensitive data. Its structure is standard for a simple script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, straightforward script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It serves only to output a greeting message and contains no suspicious or malicious code.",
