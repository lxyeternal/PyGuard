{
  "purpose": "Simple script that prints a greeting message to the console",
  "sources": "User input or external data sources are not present; no data is read",
  "sinks": "Output to console via print statement; no data leakage or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks, as the code only outputs a static message",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior; the code is straightforward and minimal",
  "analysis": "The code defines a main function that prints a static message. It then calls main() if the script is executed directly. There are no inputs, no external data reads, no network operations, or other potential security concerns. The code appears to be a basic hello-world example with no malicious intent or risky behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It only outputs a static message and contains no suspicious or harmful code.",
