  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report and compare it with the original code.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\ndef main():\n    print(\"Hello from zendesk-cli!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Analysis of the Reports:**\n\n1. **Purpose & Functionality:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the script is a simple, static greeting message. The code only prints a fixed string and does not read external data or perform any network operations.\n\n2. **Sources & Sinks:**  \n   Consistently, no external data sources or untrusted inputs are involved. The sink is a straightforward `print()` statement, which outputs to the console. No data leakage or external communication occurs.\n\n3. **Flows & Anomalies:**  \n   The reports correctly note the absence of data flows from external sources to sinks, and no anomalies like hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n4. **Security & Malicious Behavior:**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature. The overall security risk is also 0, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Confidence & Scores:**  \n   The confidence level is 1 across all reports, which seems reasonable given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n6. **Obfuscation & Malware Scores:**  \n   The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n**Potential Issues & Observations:**\n\n- **Consistency of Scores:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Justification for Risk Scores:**  \n  Since the code is entirely benign, no risk score higher than 0.1 is justified. The reports' assignment of 0 is correct.\n\n- **Malware Score Justification:**  \n  The malware score of 0 is justified, as there is no malicious activity or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Assumptions & Claims:**  \n  All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the script as benign.\n\n**Summary & Final Justification:**\n\n- The code is a minimal, straightforward script that outputs a static message.\n- No external inputs, no data leaks, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No adjustments are necessary. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that appropriately.",
