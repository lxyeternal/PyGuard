  "purpose": "Simple script that prints a greeting message to the console.",
  "sources": "Input sources are none; the code does not read external data or user input.",

  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only executes a static print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a main() function that prints a static message and a conditional block to execute main() when run directly. It contains no external data input, no data processing, and no suspicious or malicious code segments. The simplicity and static nature indicate no malicious intent or malicious behavior patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to output a greeting message. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks.",
