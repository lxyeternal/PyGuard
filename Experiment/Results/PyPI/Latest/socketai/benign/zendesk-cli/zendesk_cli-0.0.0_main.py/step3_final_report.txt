  "purpose": "A minimal Python script that prints a static greeting message.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs; the code does not read data from files, network, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "The print() function outputs to the console; no untrusted data or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only executes a static print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward script defining a main() function that prints a fixed message and executes it if run as the main module. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward greeting program with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments to scores are necessary.",
