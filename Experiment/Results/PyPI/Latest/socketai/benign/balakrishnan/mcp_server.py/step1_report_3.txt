{
  "purpose": "The code defines a module that sets up a FastMCP instance with tool and resource decorators for adding numbers and generating personalized greetings.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the parameter 'name' in get_greeting function, which is used in the resource URL. No other data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The get_greeting function returns a string that includes the 'name' parameter, potentially leading to injection if used in a context that executes the output. The add function performs a simple addition, which is safe.",
  "flows": "The 'name' parameter flows from the resource URL 'greeting://{name}' into the get_greeting function, which then returns a string containing the name.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses decorators for registering tools and resources but does not include any network activity, file access, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a FastMCP instance, registers a tool for addition, and a resource for personalized greetings. The input 'name' is used directly in a string returned to the user, but without further context, this appears benign. The absence of network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution suggests low risk. The use of decorators and string formatting is standard. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward setup of a FastMCP server with two endpoints: one for adding numbers and another for greeting. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code is benign, with no anomalies or malware detected.",
