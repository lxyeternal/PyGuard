{
  "purpose": "Define a FastMCP server with two registered resources: a tool for addition and a resource for personalized greeting.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; the code reads parameters 'name' from the resource URL.",
  "sinks": "No dangerous sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' flows from URL resource to string formatting in get_greeting function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of decorators for resource registration is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external module and creates an instance. It registers a tool function 'add' and a resource 'get_greeting' with the MCP server. Both functions are simple and do not perform any insecure operations. There are no network calls, no data leaks, and no obfuscated or malicious code detected. The code structure is straightforward and appears intended for simple functionality provision without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a basic MCP server with harmless resource definitions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
