{
  "purpose": "Registering a tool for addition and a resource for personalized greeting within the FastMCP framework.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a', 'b', and 'name' used in functions; imported class 'FastMCP'.",
  "sinks": "Return statements outputting formatted strings; no external sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into return statements directly without execution or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'name' in string formatting could be a concern if misused, but in this context, it is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a framework component, creates an instance, and registers two simple functions: one for addition, one for greeting. No network, file, or environment interactions are present. The functions perform benign operations; 'name' is used in string formatting but only returned as a string, posing minimal risk. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are detected. The potential injection concern is overestimated, as no code execution occurs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the minimal potential for misuse, but the code remains fundamentally safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
