{
  "purpose": "This code defines a module that registers tools and resources with the mcp server framework, enabling addition operations and personalized greetings.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters: 'name' for get_greeting, and 'a' and 'b' for add.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the return statements that output the results; however, no untrusted data is directly sent to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters ('name', 'a', 'b') into functions and then back to the output; no external network or file I/O is involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code relies on an imported module 'mcp.server.fastmcp', which appears to be a framework component, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a server framework component and registers two functions: 'add' and 'get_greeting'. Both functions are simple, safe, and perform basic operations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions' inputs are straightforward, and outputs are returned directly without manipulation. No anomalies or obfuscation detected. The code appears to serve a typical purpose of defining tools and resources within a framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply registers functions with a framework, performing basic operations with no suspicious activity.",
