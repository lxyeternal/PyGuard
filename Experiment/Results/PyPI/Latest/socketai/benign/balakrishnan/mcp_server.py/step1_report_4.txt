{
  "purpose": "This code defines a module that utilizes the 'mcp.server.fastmcp' library to register tools and resources, such as an addition function and a greeting function, with a resource identifier.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters 'a', 'b', and 'name'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data lead to data leaks or security effects; functions are simple and do not involve external data outputs or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a', 'b', and 'name' flow into functions but are only used for benign operations like addition and string formatting; no external or system calls are made.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The use of decorators and resource registration appears straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external module and registers two functions as tools/resources via decorators. The 'add' function performs simple addition, and 'get_greeting' returns a formatted greeting string. There are no external network calls, file I/O, environment variable accesses, or other potentially malicious actions. No anomalies or signs of obfuscation are present. The functions serve clearly defined, benign purposes within a tool/resource registration framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module registering utility functions for addition and greeting within a framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks identified.",
