{
  "purpose": "Define and register a tool function for addition and a resource function for personalized greeting using the mcp.server.fastmcp framework.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; the functions receive parameters from their respective callers or framework.",
  "sinks": "The functions return values; potential concern if untrusted input reaches these functions via resource parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (name) from resource URL flow into get_greeting, output is a greeting string; add takes two integers and returns their sum.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code structures. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a framework and defines two functions: one for addition and one for greeting. Both functions are decorated for registration with the framework, possibly exposing them via an API. The get_greeting function accepts a string parameter 'name' from the resource URL and returns a greeting message, which could include untrusted input. However, the use of the input does not lead to code injection or data leakage as it only formats and returns the string. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code appears straightforward, intended to register simple tools and resources within the framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign registration of a tool and a resource within a framework. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It simply registers two functions with the framework, with safe handling of parameters.",
