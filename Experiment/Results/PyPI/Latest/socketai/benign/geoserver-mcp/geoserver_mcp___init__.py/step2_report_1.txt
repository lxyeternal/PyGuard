  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   The code is simply a package metadata snippet: a docstring and a version string assignment. There are no input/output operations, data flows, or executable logic.  \n   **Confirmed:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n   All reports correctly identify the code as minimal, benign, and free of suspicious behavior. They uniformly note the absence of data handling, external interactions, or obfuscation.  \n   **No significant errors or flaws** are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - confidence: 1\n   - obfuscated: 0\n   - malware: 0\n   - securityRisk: 0  \n   \n   These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features. No adjustments seem necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n   Since all scores are zero for malware and security risk, and the code is purely a version declaration, there is no justification for higher scores.  \n   **Confirmed:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n   The code does not perform any malicious activity, obfuscation, or hidden behavior. The malware score of 0 is accurate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   All reports avoid speculative claims and base their conclusions on the code's actual content.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature—simple, benign, and metadata-only.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a straightforward version declaration with no security concerns, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The current evaluation correctly reflects the code's benign nature.",
