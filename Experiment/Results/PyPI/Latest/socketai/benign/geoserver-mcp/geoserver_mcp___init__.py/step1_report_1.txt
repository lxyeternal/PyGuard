  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a docstring describing the package, a version string, and no executable logic or external interactions. There are no sources, sinks, or data flows indicating potential security issues or malicious behavior. The version string is a standard practice for package versioning, and the docstring provides descriptive context. No secrets, obfuscated code, or risky behavior is present.",
