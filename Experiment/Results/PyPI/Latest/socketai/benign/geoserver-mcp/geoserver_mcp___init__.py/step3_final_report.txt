{
  "purpose": "Declare the package version and provide a brief description of the module.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only a static string assignment (__version__ = \"0.1.0\") and a docstring.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data, nor does it interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is static metadata without dynamic execution or data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module with a descriptive docstring and a version string assignment. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and do not require modification.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
