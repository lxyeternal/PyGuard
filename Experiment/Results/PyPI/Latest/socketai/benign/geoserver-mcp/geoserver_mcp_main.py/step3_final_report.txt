{
  "purpose": "This code implements a GeoServer resource management API wrapper, facilitating geospatial data operations via REST API calls, including resource listing, creation, deletion, querying, and map generation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for credentials, user inputs for resource identifiers, external HTTP requests in 'query_features' and map generation functions.",
  "sinks": "External HTTP requests to GeoServer REST endpoints, data returned from these requests, and environment variables for credentials.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (credentials, resource identifiers, filters) are used in functions that perform REST API calls, with responses processed and returned as JSON objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected. Credential defaults are present but configurable via environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper with standard practices: credentials via environment variables, REST API interactions, external HTTP requests for data and map services. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present. Error handling is routine, and external requests are typical for geospatial operations. The use of default credentials ('admin', 'geoserver') is a common initial setup but should be secured in deployment. No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage are evident. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscated as 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to credential handling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured GeoServer management API with no malicious intent or behaviors. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality. No modifications are necessary.",
