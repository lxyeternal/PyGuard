{
  "purpose": "The code implements a MCP server that connects to GeoServer REST API to provide geospatial data management functionalities, including listing, creating, deleting resources, querying features, and generating maps.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (GEOSERVER_URL, GEOSERVER_USER, GEOSERVER_PASSWORD); command-line arguments for URL, user, password; API request parameters (filters, layer info, styles, map options); external requests to geo.get_* methods and requests.get() for WFS queries.",
  "sinks": "Calls to geo.* methods that perform resource modifications (create, delete, update resources); external HTTP requests (requests.get) for querying features; URL construction for WMS map generation.",
  "flows": "User provides inputs via environment variables, command-line args, or API parameters, which flow into geo.* API method calls or external HTTP requests. Data flows from sources through API calls or external requests, potentially returning resource info, map URLs, or query results.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for credentials and URL, which is common but could be misused if env vars are compromised. No hardcoded secrets other than default credentials. External requests for feature queries are made with user-provided filters, but no explicit injection or unsafe execution is evident. No obfuscated code, code injection, or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly performs standard API interactions with GeoServer, managing resources, querying data, and generating map URLs. Credentials are fetched from environment variables with default fallbacks, which is typical but should be handled securely. External requests to WFS are constructed with user inputs (filters, properties) but are used as URL parameters, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but this is a typical pattern for such services. No hardcoded credentials beyond defaults. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors like data exfiltration, network backdoors, or system modification. The external requests are limited to data retrieval. Overall, the code appears to be a standard API wrapper and server implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a geospatial management server interacting with GeoServer. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It correctly handles resource management, data querying, and map generation without suspicious or malicious patterns.",
