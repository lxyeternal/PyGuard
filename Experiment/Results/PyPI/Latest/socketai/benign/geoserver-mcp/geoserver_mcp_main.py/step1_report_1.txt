  "purpose": "Implement a GeoServer management API that allows listing, creating, deleting resources, querying features, and generating maps via a REST API connection, enabling AI assistants to manage geospatial data.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (GEOSERVER_URL, GEOSERVER_USER, GEOSERVER_PASSWORD), command-line arguments, HTTP requests to WFS service, REST API calls within geo.Geoserver methods.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external WFS/WMS endpoints, environment variables, and REST API calls within geo.Geoserver methods.",
  "flows": "Inputs from environment variables and command-line arguments flow into the get_geoserver() function to establish a connection. Resource handlers and tools invoke geo.Geoserver methods, which may send HTTP requests to external services, retrieve data, and process it for responses.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for credentials is standard; no hard-coded secrets found. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. No hidden backdoors or suspicious network activity detected. Logging of errors could potentially leak info if logs are exposed but is standard practice. No code injection or unsafe evals identified.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a REST API interface for GeoServer management, relying on environment variables and command-line args for configuration. It uses the geo.Geoserver class to perform operations like listing resources, creating/deleting layers, workspaces, styles, and querying features. HTTP requests are made to external WFS/WMS services for feature data and map images, with parameters constructed from function inputs. No hardcoded credentials other than defaults, no use of eval or exec, and no network activity beyond standard REST and HTTP requests. Error handling logs errors but does not expose sensitive data. The code structure appears straightforward and intended for legitimate geospatial management functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate management and querying of GeoServer resources with no indicators of malicious intent. It uses environment variables for credentials, which is typical but should be monitored for secrets exposure in logs or external storage. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful network activity are detected. Overall, it appears to be a standard, functional API wrapper for GeoServer without malicious behavior.",
