{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform image pre-processing and inference using a pre-trained SPAGHETTI model, including transformations and saving output images.",
  "sources": "Reading model checkpoint from a file path; loading images from list inputs; reading environment and device info",
  "sinks": "Saving images to specified directory; loading model state_dict from disk",
  "flows": "Model checkpoint is loaded from disk and used for inference; images are transformed, processed, and optionally saved to disk",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors observed. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a neural network model, loads weights from a specified checkpoint, performs image transformations (default or custom), runs inference on images, normalizes outputs, and optionally saves the results. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or suspicious operations are present. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are evident. All operations appear consistent with typical image processing and model inference workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for image preprocessing and inference using a deep learning model. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code does not contain obfuscation or malware; it functions as expected for its purpose.",
