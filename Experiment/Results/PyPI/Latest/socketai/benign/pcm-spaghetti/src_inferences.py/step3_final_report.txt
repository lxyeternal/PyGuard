{
  "purpose": "Perform inference on images using a pre-trained SPAGHETTI model, including preprocessing, model loading, and optional saving of output images.",
  "sources": "Model checkpoint file loaded via torch.load; image inputs from list of PIL.Image, torch.Tensor, or numpy.ndarray; image transformations applied in _default_transform.",
  "sinks": "Saving transformed images to specified directory; no data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Images are input into pre_processing (source), transformed via default or custom transform, then passed into inference (source), which outputs processed images, optionally saved to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. Model loading from disk is standard but relies on source trust.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image preprocessing, model inference, and output saving. No network activity, backdoors, or malicious code are present. Model checkpoint loading is typical but should be from a trusted source. No obfuscation or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code structure is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external model trustworthiness, which is acknowledged but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for image inference with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The minor security concern about external model source is justified and does not elevate the overall risk significantly.",
