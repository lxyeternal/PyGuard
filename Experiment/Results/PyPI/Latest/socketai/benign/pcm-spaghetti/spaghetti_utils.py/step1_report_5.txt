  "purpose": "Utility function to find the latest checkpoint file in a directory for PyTorch Lightning.",
  "sources": "Reads directory structure via os.walk; accesses file names and paths; uses os.path.getctime for file creation time.",
  "sinks": "None that lead to data leaks or security effects; no untrusted data output or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Reads directory contents -> filters files ending with .ckpt -> determines the most recent by creation time.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious external calls, no unusual logic beyond standard file handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward directory traversal using os.walk, filtering for checkpoint files, and returning the most recent one based on creation time. All operations are standard library calls without any external network or system modifications. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. It appears to be a utility function intended for managing model checkpoints.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for finding checkpoint files; it does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
