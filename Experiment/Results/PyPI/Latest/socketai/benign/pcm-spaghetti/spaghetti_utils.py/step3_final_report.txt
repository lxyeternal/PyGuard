  "purpose": "Utility function to locate the most recent checkpoint file (.ckpt) in a directory hierarchy.",
  "sources": "Filesystem traversal via os.walk, reading directory contents, and file metadata via os.path.getctime.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only filesystem access and retrieval of file paths and metadata.",
  "flows": "Input directory path -> os.walk traversal -> filtering files ending with .ckpt -> selecting max by creation time -> returning path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard library functions, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple recursive search for checkpoint files and returns the latest based on creation time. It uses standard Python functions with no external calls or malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity are present. The only minor platform-dependent behavior is the use of os.path.getctime(), which may vary across OSes but does not impact security. The code is benign and aligns with typical ML checkpoint management routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and very low risk scores. The overall assessment confirms the code's benign status, and the scoring is appropriate.",
