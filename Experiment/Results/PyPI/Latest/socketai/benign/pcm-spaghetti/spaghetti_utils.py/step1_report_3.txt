  "purpose": "Utility function to find the latest checkpoint file with .ckpt extension in a given directory for PyTorch Lightning.",
  "sources": "os.walk() to iterate through directory files, os.path.join() to build file paths, os.path.getctime() to get file creation time.",
  "sinks": "max() function to determine the most recent file based on creation time.",
  "flows": "os.walk() reads directory structure -> collects checkpoint files -> max() with getctime() determines latest file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated code detected. The function performs straightforward file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, defines a function to locate checkpoint files with .ckpt extension, traverses directory structure, and returns the most recent checkpoint based on creation time. It appears to be a utility function without any hidden or malicious behavior. No network activity, data leakage, or suspicious code execution is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for locating checkpoint files and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It operates safely within its intended scope.",
