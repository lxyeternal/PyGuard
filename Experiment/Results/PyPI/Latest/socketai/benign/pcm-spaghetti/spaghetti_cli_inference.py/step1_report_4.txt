  "purpose": "CLI interface for performing image translation inference using the SPAGHETTI model",
  "sources": "Reads input path, output path, and checkpoint file from command-line arguments; reads image files from filesystem",
  "sinks": "File system operations (reading images, checking checkpoint existence, saving output images)",
  "flows": "User provides input paths and checkpoint; code loads images; model processes images; results are saved to output directory",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected; no obfuscated code, backdoors, or data exfiltration observed",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard CLI wrapper for image inference using a pre-trained model. It verifies the checkpoint file exists, loads images from a directory or single file, and performs inference. The code uses well-known libraries (os, argparse, PIL) and a model class from 'spaghetti' which appears to be a legitimate package. There are no signs of malicious data handling, network activity, or secret exfiltration. No hardcoded credentials or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical CLI interface for image inference. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe based on the provided code.",
