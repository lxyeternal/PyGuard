  "purpose": "CLI interface for running inference on images using the SPAGHETTI model.",
  "sources": "User-provided input and output paths, checkpoint path, files read during os.walk and Image.open.",
  "sinks": "Image.open() reads image files; os.path.exists() checks checkpoint existence; inferences.Spaghetti() loads model; model.inference() likely processes and saves images.",
  "flows": "Input paths are processed, images are loaded via Image.open(), paths are passed to model.inference for processing and saving.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. Use of os.walk and PIL.Image is standard. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a command-line interface for image translation. It reads input paths, verifies checkpoint existence, loads images with PIL, and performs inference using a model. The checkpoint path is validated for existence, which is standard. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of standard libraries and calls appears normal and appropriate for the purpose. No obfuscated patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI tool for image processing using the SPAGHETTI model. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the analysis. It follows typical patterns for such applications and does not exhibit anomalies indicative of malware or sabotage.",
