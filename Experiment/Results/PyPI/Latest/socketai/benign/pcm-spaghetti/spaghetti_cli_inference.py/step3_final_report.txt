  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for image inference using the SPAGHETTI model, handling input paths, checkpoint validation, image loading, and inference invocation.",
  "sources": "Input arguments for input path, output directory, and checkpoint file; reading image files; loading checkpoint file.",
  "sinks": "Loading images with PIL; invoking model inference; saving output images to specified directory.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> input validation -> image file loading -> model instantiation -> inference processing -> output saving.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected. Code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a CLI tool for image inference, handling directory and file inputs, validating checkpoint existence, loading images, and performing inference via an external 'spaghetti' library. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted commands. External dependencies are standard for image processing and model inference. The scoring of malware as 0, obfuscation as 0, and low security risk (~0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are identified. The code's logic is clear, and the absence of malicious indicators supports a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe CLI utility for image inference with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
