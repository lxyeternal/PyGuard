  "purpose": "CLI inference script for processing images using the SPAGHETTI model.",
  "sources": "Reads input path (file or directory), checkpoint file path, and image files from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Image processing functions, model inference, and file system operations (loading/saving images, checking file existence).",
  "flows": "Input path → os.path.isdir or os.path.basename → Image.open → model.pre_processing → model.inference → saving images.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network activity or obfuscated code; only standard library and 'spaghetti' library usage. No data leakage, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard CLI argument parsing, input validation, image loading, and inference using a model from an external library. It checks for the existence of the checkpoint file. No untrusted data is sent over the network. All file handling appears typical. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present. The script's purpose aligns with normal image processing workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool for image inference with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It utilizes external libraries appropriately and does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
