  "purpose": "CLI entry point for performing image inference using the SPAGHETTI model.",
  "sources": "os.path.isdir, os.walk, os.path.join, os.path.basename, os.path.exists, Image.open, inferences.Spaghetti, argparse argument inputs",
  "sinks": "Image.open (reads image files), model.inference (potentially processes data, but no direct sink for untrusted data), print statements",
  "flows": "User inputs (input path, output path, checkpoint) -> validation and file reading -> model instantiation -> image processing -> inference output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads input paths and checkpoint files, opens image files for processing, and performs inference with the imported model. It validates the existence of checkpoint files, handles directory traversal for images, and uses standard libraries. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. The code relies on external libraries such as 'spaghetti' and 'PIL', which are standard for image processing. No network connections or suspicious data handling are observed. The overall flow is typical for an inference CLI, with no anomalous or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a safe CLI tool for image inference, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It properly handles inputs and utilizes external libraries without suspicious activity.",
