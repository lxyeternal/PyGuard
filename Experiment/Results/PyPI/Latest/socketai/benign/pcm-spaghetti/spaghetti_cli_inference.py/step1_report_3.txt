  "purpose": "CLI utility for performing inference on images using the SPAGHETTI model.",
  "sources": "Reads input paths (files or directories), checkpoint file path, and processes images with PIL.",
  "sinks": "Uses image processing functions and file system operations; no direct untrusted data sinks found.",
  "flows": "Input paths -> os.walk or os.path functions -> Image.open() -> model.inference() -> save outputs",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input paths and checkpoint file paths, performs standard image processing, and runs inference via imported model. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of os and PIL libraries is standard. The only user-input-dependent operations are reading files and running inference, with no malicious commands or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a straightforward CLI wrapper for image inference using the SPAGHETTI model. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
