  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some operation involving data processing or network communication, though the specific intent is unclear without detailed context.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from user input, environment variables, or external files, but no explicit source code for data input is provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writes, or system commands if present; however, no such functions are explicitly identified in the code snippet provided.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows are observable from the code snippet, as the code primarily consists of definitions and straightforward logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution, are evident. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python constructs without signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful network activity. Usage of third-party libraries, if any, appears typical. No suspicious data handling, environment variable misuse, or unsafe SQL/database operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign with no malicious behavior detected.",
