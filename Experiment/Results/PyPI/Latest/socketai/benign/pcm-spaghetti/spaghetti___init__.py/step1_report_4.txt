  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task, but the exact intent is unclear due to missing or unspecified code segments. It likely involves data processing or interaction with external systems.",
  "sources": "Data is read from user input, environment variables, or external files. Specific source locations are not provided due to missing code context.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands. Exact sink locations are not evident from the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables, files) to sinks (network, file system, system commands). Due to incomplete code, specific paths cannot be fully traced.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious functions are detected from the incomplete snippet. Lack of context limits thorough detection.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is incomplete, making it difficult to analyze comprehensively. No malicious patterns, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are apparent in the visible segments. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious by itself. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code behaviors are identified. The absence of specific details prevents full source-to-sink mapping.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign; however, due to missing parts, a low-confidence assessment is necessary. No evidence of obfuscation or malware is observed.",
  "confidence": 0.4,
  "obfuscated": 0,
