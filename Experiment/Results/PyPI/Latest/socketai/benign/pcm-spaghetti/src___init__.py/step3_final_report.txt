  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on supply chain threats.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network connections, dynamic execution functions (eval), hardcoded secrets, input/output functions.",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints, file system, environment variables, logs, console output.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval() or environment variables leading to network connections or file modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval(), obfuscation, suspicious network activity, hardcoded credentials, unusual imports, dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to eval() usage, obfuscation, and network activity, indicating malicious intent with high malware (0.8), obfuscation (0.7), and security risk (0.8). Benign scripts show no suspicious patterns, with scores appropriately low. Limited or no code results in low scores with high confidence. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors, and the analysis supports the high risk in the malicious case.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency contains high-risk malicious code as indicated by eval(), obfuscation, and network activity, warranting caution. Benign scripts are correctly scored as low risk. Overall, the supply chain risk is dominated by the malicious code, with a score of approximately 0.8.",
