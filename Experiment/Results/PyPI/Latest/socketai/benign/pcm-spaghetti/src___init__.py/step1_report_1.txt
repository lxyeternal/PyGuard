{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, potentially for data processing or utility functions, but no explicit purpose is clearly indicated.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from environment variables and potentially from external files or network sources if present in omitted parts.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to the console, logs, or external files. No evidence of data leaks or untrusted data handling found in visible parts.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or inputs through processing functions to outputs such as print statements or file writes. No suspicious flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs identified. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code was reviewed for malicious patterns, including network connections, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No such patterns were detected. The code uses standard library functions, with no suspicious external calls or suspicious data handling. The structure appears typical for a utility or processing script, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. Absence of encrypted or encoded segments, dynamic imports, or hidden code suggests a benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. It appears to be a standard, benign script with no indicators of malware or supply chain threats.",
