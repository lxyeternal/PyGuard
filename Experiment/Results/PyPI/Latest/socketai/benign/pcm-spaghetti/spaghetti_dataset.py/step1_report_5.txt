  "purpose": "Define a dataset class for training a machine learning model on paired image data from two domains.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from specified directory paths using os.listdir and os.path.join.",
  "sinks": "Uses Image.open() to load image files; no data written or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Reads image files from disk, applies transformations, and returns processed images.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or malicious behavior detected. No use of unsafe eval, exec, or network connections.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes by collecting image file paths from provided directories, with optional sampling. It employs random.seed for reproducibility. The dataset length is set to the maximum number of images across domains. __getitem__ loads images via PIL.Image.open and applies transformations. No external network activity, no code injection, or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign dataset loader for machine learning tasks. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
