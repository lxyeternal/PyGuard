{
  "purpose": "This code prepares datasets for training and inference in a machine learning context, specifically loading images from specified directories and applying transformations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from directory paths provided as arguments (`path_1`, `path_2`), using `os.listdir()` to list files within these directories.",
  "sinks": "The code opens image files with `Image.open()` and processes them with provided transformation functions (`transform_1`, `transform_2`), which are assumed to be safe and user-defined.",
  "flows": "Directories are listed to gather image file paths, which are then sampled and stored; during `__getitem__`, image paths are used to load images, which are then transformed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior are present. Usage of `os.listdir()` and `Image.open()` is standard for dataset loading. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically loads image data from specified directories, handles sampling with fallback strategies, and applies transformations. No obfuscated language features or suspicious code patterns are observed. All operations are typical for dataset preparation in PyTorch. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard dataset loader for image training, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It securely loads images, applies transformations, and handles sampling without any hidden or malicious logic.",
