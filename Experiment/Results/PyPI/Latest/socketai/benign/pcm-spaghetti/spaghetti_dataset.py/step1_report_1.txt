{
  "purpose": "Prepare datasets for training and inference of the SPAGHETTI model, involving image loading, transformation, and sampling.",
  "sources": "Paths to image directories provided in path_1 and path_2, reading filenames with os.listdir.",
  "sinks": "Image.open used to load images from paths, and potentially transform functions applied to images.",
  "flows": "Paths are generated from directory listings, images are loaded via Image.open, then transformed, and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behaviors. Usage of random.seed for reproducibility is normal. No hidden network activity or backdoors observed. The code appears to handle file paths securely, relying on standard libraries. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes datasets by collecting image file paths from provided directories, with optional sampling. It handles multiple image formats and ensures consistent dataset size through modulo indexing. Image loading and transformation are straightforward and use standard libraries. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious patterns identified. The code's purpose is data preparation, and it does not perform any network operations or secret data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dataset loader for image data with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It uses common practices for data sampling and image processing. No security concerns are evident.",
