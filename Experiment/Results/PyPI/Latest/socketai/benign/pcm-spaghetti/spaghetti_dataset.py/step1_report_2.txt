  "purpose": "Prepare datasets for training and inference in a machine learning model involving image data from two domains.",
  "sources": "Reads directory contents with os.listdir() to gather image file paths; loads images using PIL.Image.open().",
  "sinks": "Uses Image.open() to load images; accesses file paths from the provided directory lists.",
  "flows": "Directory paths -> os.listdir() -> file list -> path joining -> Image.open() -> transforms applied -> returned images.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no malicious code; no obfuscated code; only standard library and typical image processing libraries are used.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a dataset class that collects image file paths from provided directories, samples a subset if specified, and loads images with PIL for training. It does not execute any network operations, system modifications, or execute code from untrusted sources beyond reading directory contents and loading image files. The code uses standard Python functions and well-known libraries (random, os, PIL, torch). There are no signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The logic is straightforward for dataset preparation, with no hidden or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dataset loader for image data in machine learning. It performs directory traversal, file path handling, image loading, and transformation application in a typical manner without any malicious activity or sabotage indications.",
