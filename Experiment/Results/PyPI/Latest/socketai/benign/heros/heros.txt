The potential risks are typical for callback systems executing untrusted functions and transmitting data over networks, but these do not indicate malicious intent. The scores and evaluations across the reports are accurate and justified."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard serialization/deserialization utility supporting complex objects and remote references. It does not contain malicious code but presents a moderate security risk if untrusted data is deserialized, primarily due to the use of getattr on remote objects. Proper validation, sandboxing, or strict data validation is recommended when handling untrusted inputs. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly 0; the security risk score should be adjusted to 0.5 to reflect the potential exploitation vector."

The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the potential for unhandled exceptions but not a security threat."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 assigned in some reports slightly overstates the risk but remains conservative. The malware score is correctly 0. Given the analysis, the code is safe for use, and the scores are appropriate."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate HERO management framework over Zenoh, with no signs of malicious behavior. The primary security risk stems from deserialization of untrusted data, which could be exploited if payloads are malicious. However, the code itself does not contain malicious payloads or sabotage. The risk is moderate, primarily due to lack of input validation, but overall the code appears intended for legitimate remote object management."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The main security issue is the use of eval() in lambdify(), which can execute arbitrary code if the input expression is malicious. No malware or obfuscation is present. The security risk should be rated high (around 0.7–0.75) due to the potential for code injection. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0. Recommendations include replacing eval() with safer parsing methods or validating inputs to prevent exploitation."
