  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\nThe code is a set of import statements from local modules:\n```python\nfrom .heros import *  # noqa: F401, F403\nfrom .datasource.datasource import LocalDatasourceHERO, PolledLocalDatasourceHERO, DatasourceObserver  # noqa: F401\nfrom .event import event  # noqa: F401\n```\nThis pattern suggests a modular package structure, possibly an `__init__.py` file or similar, intended to expose certain components for use elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct.\n- **Malicious activity:** No code execution, network activity, or data handling is visible here.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code; the code is straightforward import statements.\n- **Suspicious patterns:** The only potentially risky pattern is the use of `from .heros import *`, which can obscure imported symbols.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the report's reasoning\n- The reports correctly identify the wildcard import as a potential maintainability issue but do not consider it inherently malicious.\n- They correctly note the absence of runtime data flows, network activity, or code execution.\n- The assumption that these imports could hide malicious code is unfounded here because the code is static and only involves local module imports.\n\n### Scoring analysis\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign `0`, which is reasonable.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly low (around 0.1-0.2), which aligns with the minimal security concern here—mainly maintainability and clarity issues due to wildcard import.\n\n### Justification for scores\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0** since no malicious behavior is detected.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay at **0**; no obfuscation is present.\n- The **risk score** could be slightly higher if considering maintainability and clarity, but since no security vulnerability is present, scores around 0.1-0.2 are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (due to wildcard import and style considerations)\n\n---\n\n### Final notes\n- The reports are consistent in their reasoning.\n- The main concern is style/maintainability rather than security.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent or activity.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0              |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1 to 0.2     |\n\nThe code appears benign; the only potential issue is the wildcard import, which should be replaced with explicit imports for clarity and maintainability but does not pose a security threat.",
