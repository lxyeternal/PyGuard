  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scores provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n```python\nfrom .heros import *  # noqa: F401, F403\nfrom .datasource.datasource import LocalDatasourceHERO, PolledLocalDatasourceHERO, DatasourceObserver  # noqa: F401\nfrom .event import event  # noqa: F401\n```\nThis code only performs import statements from local modules, with no execution, data handling, or external interactions visible.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as import statements, notes the use of wildcard import which can obscure imported symbols, but finds no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.8\n- **Assessment:** The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The security risk is minimal, given no execution or data flow.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the wildcard import and lack of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.8\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The minimal risk score aligns with the absence of suspicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Repeats the same observations, notes the wildcard import and no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The zero risk score matches the analysis. High confidence is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous reports, acknowledges the wildcard import but finds no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.6\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score due to the wildcard import, which is a style concern but not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable; wildcard import warrants caution but not suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above, notes the import pattern, finds no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is straightforward import statements; no execution, data flow, or network activity.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** The scores are low across the board, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n- **Wildcard import concern:** The main point of contention is the use of `from .heros import *`. While not inherently malicious, it can obscure imported symbols, which is a maintainability concern but not a security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **My assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to wildcard import which could cause maintainability issues but not security risks.\n\n**Final justification:** The code is typical for a module's import section, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The wildcard import is a style issue but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe scores given in the reports are reasonable, and I agree with the overall assessment that this code is safe and not malicious.",
