  "purpose": "Import statements for modules and classes within a Python package, likely setting up dependencies for further code execution.",
  "sources": "Import statements accessing local modules and classes: 'heros', 'datasource.datasource', and 'event'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; import statements do not typically involve data flows or untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present; code only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import from '.heros' could obscure imported symbols, but this is a common practice and not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains import statements bringing in modules and classes from local package components. The wildcard import from '.heros' is a notable point but not suspicious by itself. No dynamic code execution, no network operations, no obfuscated code, and no evident malicious logic. The imports suggest modular design, possibly for a larger application, but do not pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs straightforward import operations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The wildcard import is a stylistic choice but not inherently dangerous. Overall, this code fragment appears safe.",
