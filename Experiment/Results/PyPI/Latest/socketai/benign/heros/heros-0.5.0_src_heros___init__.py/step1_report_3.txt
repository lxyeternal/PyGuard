{
  "purpose": "This code imports modules and components from the same package or submodules, likely for use in a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "Imports from .heros, .datasource.datasource, and .event modules",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Imports may flow into the current namespace for further use, but no data flow from untrusted sources is evident",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*) from .heros can obscure which symbols are imported; no explicit malicious activity evident",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports of modules and classes, including a wildcard import which is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious. No code execution, data handling, or network activity is present. The use of 'noqa' comments suggests adherence to linter rules, but nothing suspicious is directly visible. Without additional context or code execution, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard module imports with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The wildcard import could be a maintainability concern but does not imply malicious activity.",
