{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module import statement, intended to include various components such as heroes, data sources, and events for use in a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .heros, .datasource.datasource, and .event",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet; it only imports components",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow is observable in these import statements alone",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('from .heros import *') which can obscure which components are imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended imports; no explicit suspicious code or hardcoded secrets present",
  "analysis": "The code only performs import operations from local modules, with no execution of untrusted input, network activity, or code injection. The wildcard import could mask imported elements, but alone, it is not inherently malicious. No other suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code are evident. The import statements suggest modular design but do not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on these import statements, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is typical of a Python package structure, with a note on the use of wildcard import which can be risky for maintainability but not malicious.",
