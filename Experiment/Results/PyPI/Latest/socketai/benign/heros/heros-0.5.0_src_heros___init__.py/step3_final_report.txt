{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules and symbols from local package components, likely to expose functionality for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Local module files: '.heros', '.datasource.datasource', and '.event' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only performs static import statements.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code simply imports symbols from local modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import 'from .heros import *', which can obscure imported symbols and affect maintainability but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, with no runtime logic, data handling, or network activity. The wildcard import is a stylistic concern rather than a security issue. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate, reflecting the benign nature of the code and minor maintainability considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The primary concern is maintainability due to the wildcard import, but it does not pose a security threat. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the code can be considered safe.",
