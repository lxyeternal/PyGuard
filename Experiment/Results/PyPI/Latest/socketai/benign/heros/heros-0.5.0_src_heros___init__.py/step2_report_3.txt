  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Code snippet for reference:**\n```python\nfrom .heros import *  # noqa: F401, F403\nfrom .datasource.datasource import LocalDatasourceHERO, PolledLocalDatasourceHERO, DatasourceObserver  # noqa: F401\nfrom .event import event  # noqa: F401\n```\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- All reports recognize that this is a module import statement.\n- The primary concern raised is the use of `from .heros import *`, which is a wildcard import.\n- No evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, network activity, or obfuscated code is observed.\n- The reports assign low security risk and malware scores, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code does **not** contain any executable logic, untrusted data handling, or network activity.\n- The import statements are local, referencing internal modules.\n- The wildcard import could obscure which symbols are imported, potentially leading to maintainability issues but not malicious behavior.\n\n### Flaws or reasoning issues:\n- The reports are consistent in their assessment: no malicious activity, no vulnerabilities evident from import statements.\n- They correctly identify that the wildcard import is a stylistic or maintainability concern, not a security threat.\n- The scores for malware (0) and obfuscated (0) are appropriate.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- The **malware score** is 0 across all reports, which is justified given the code.\n- The **security risk** scores are low (~0.1-0.2), which is reasonable.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The only point of contention is the wildcard import. While it can hide imported symbols, it is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n- The reports seem to overemphasize the risk of wildcard imports, but in the context of security, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** approximately 0.1-0.2 (low, mainly maintainability concern)\n\n---\n\n### **My conclusion:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, **there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk**. The scores assigned are reasonable, and the reasoning is sound.\n\n**If I were to assign scores myself:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to wildcard import concern but not a security issue)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. The main concern is maintainability, not security.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways consider broader context, but based solely on this snippet, no malicious activity is present.",
