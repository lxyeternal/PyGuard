  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a set of import statements, with a wildcard import from `.heros`. No suspicious activity, code execution, or malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. The risk score is low, reflecting minimal concern.\n- **Assessment:** The use of wildcard import is noted as a potential maintainability issue but not malicious. The confidence is 0.8, which is reasonable given the limited context.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the wildcard import and standard import patterns. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, indicating very low concern.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the previous report; the risk score seems appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—import statements, wildcard import from `.heros`. No malicious activity observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, suggesting negligible risk.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with prior assessments; wildcard import is a style concern but not malicious.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar import statements, wildcard import noted. No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score, possibly due to the wildcard import, but still low overall.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, straightforward imports, wildcard import present, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code snippet is purely import statements.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation is apparent.\n- **Risk Scores:** The risk scores are very low (0 to 0.2), which aligns with the fact that import statements alone are unlikely to pose significant security risks unless they involve malicious modules or obfuscated code.\n\n### Notable points:\n- The wildcard import from `.heros` is repeatedly flagged as a potential concern, mainly for maintainability and clarity, not malicious intent.\n- No evidence of code execution, network activity, or embedded secrets.\n- The overall structure appears standard for a Python package's `__init__.py` or module import section.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of malicious activity and the nature of the code, a risk score of around 0.1 seems appropriate, with a slight possibility of concern due to the wildcard import, but overall very low.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value |\n|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware         | 0               |\n| Obfuscated      | 0               |\n| Risk            | 0.1             |\n\nThis reflects that the code is benign, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation, and minimal security risk primarily due to coding style choices.",
