  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for parsing key expressions and retrieving class names.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'key_expr' in object_name_from_keyexpr function",
  "sinks": "re.search function which extracts data from 'key_expr'",
  "flows": "Input 'key_expr' -> re.search pattern matching -> extraction of groups",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex with dynamic pattern; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns; no external network or system calls",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries 're' and 'logging', defines a logger, and implements two functions. The 'object_name_from_keyexpr' function uses regex to extract a segment from a string based on a pattern that includes parameters. The pattern is constructed dynamically but does not contain hardcoded secrets or external data sources. The 'full_classname' function retrieves an object's class and module name, handling built-in modules distinctly. Both functions perform straightforward, non-malicious operations, with no evident data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for string pattern matching and class name retrieval. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are detected based on the provided code segment.",
