  "purpose": "Utility functions for extracting object names from key expressions and retrieving fully qualified class names.",
  "sources": "The function object_name_from_keyexpr reads the key_expr string; full_classname accesses the object's __class__ and __module__ attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present; functions operate on input parameters and object attributes only.",
  "flows": "The regex search extracts a substring from key_expr; full_classname constructs a string from object's class info. No external data flow or output manipulation occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Potential unhandled exception if re.search does not find a match, leading to an AttributeError when calling groups()[0]. No obfuscation or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions with minimal complexity. The regex operation relies on input that may not match, risking runtime exceptions but not malicious activity. The class name retrieval is safe and standard. The logger is instantiated but unused, which is benign. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The main concern is exception handling, not security compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions with a minor runtime exception risk due to unvalidated regex matching. No malicious activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the potential for unhandled exceptions but not a security threat.",
