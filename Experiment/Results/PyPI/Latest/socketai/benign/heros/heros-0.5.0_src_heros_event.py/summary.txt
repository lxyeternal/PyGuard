  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign callback and event management framework with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. The potential risks are typical for callback systems executing untrusted functions and transmitting data over networks, but these do not indicate malicious intent. The scores and evaluations across the reports are accurate and justified."
