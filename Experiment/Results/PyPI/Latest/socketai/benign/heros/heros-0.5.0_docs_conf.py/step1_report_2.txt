  "sources": "Reads project metadata (project, author, copyright), configuration settings, and extension lists from the code.",

  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Extensions used are standard for documentation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation. It specifies project info, extensions, templates, HTML options, and autoapi settings. No dynamic execution, no input parsing, and no data transmission functions are present. All extensions are common and relevant for documentation, with no indication of malicious intent. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical configuration file for Sphinx documentation with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity. The code appears safe and intended solely for documentation setup.",
