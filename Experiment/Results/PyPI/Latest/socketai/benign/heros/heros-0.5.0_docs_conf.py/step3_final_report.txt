  "purpose": "Static configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder, defining project info, extensions, themes, and options.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static code with predefined configuration values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows; no data leaks or external effects; purely static setup.",
  "flows": "None; static configuration without data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and static with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured Sphinx configuration file. It imports standard extensions, sets project info, themes, and options without any dynamic code, input handling, network calls, or obfuscated elements. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. The configuration is typical and safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration file for Sphinx documentation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, are appropriate and justified.",
