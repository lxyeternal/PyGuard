  "purpose": "Manage and maintain a global Zenoh session with dynamic configuration updates and automatic cleanup.",
  "sources": "Configuration dictionary input for session setup, JSON serialization of config values.",
  "sinks": "zenoh.open() for session creation, session.close() for cleanup, atexit.register for cleanup at program exit.",
  "flows": "Config data is inserted into zenoh.Config() from _config_dict, then zenoh.open() initiates a session. Session is closed via close() method during cleanup or exit.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code manages a singleton zenoh session with reference counting. Configuration is inserted via insert_json5 with JSON dumps of values, which is safe assuming the values are controlled or sanitized. Session cleanup is handled properly with automatic and manual methods. No external inputs are used directly in a way that could lead to injection or data leaks. Usage of atexit for cleanup is standard. No suspicious or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward session management utility for Zenoh with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It manages resources properly and safely. No malicious or suspicious code is present.",
