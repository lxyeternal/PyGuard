{
  "purpose": "Manage a global Zenoh session with dynamic configuration and reference counting, ensuring proper cleanup on exit.",
  "sources": "Initialization of config_dict in __init__, request_session method reads config_dict to set up the session, no external input streams",
  "sinks": "zenoh.open(config), session.close() methods, which manage network connections; potential to send or close sessions, but no malicious data transmission observed",
  "flows": "config_dict data flows into zenoh.Config via insert_json5; session creation and closure based on reference counting, no untrusted data flow identified",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code, no obfuscated code. Use of json.dumps on values is standard; no signs of malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines a session manager that maintains a singleton zenoh session, creates it when needed, and closes it when no longer referenced. It updates configuration dynamically. There are no input sources that could inject malicious data; session management appears standard and secure. No network communications are initiated outside the zenoh library calls, and no data leaks or backdoors are evident. The code follows typical patterns for resource management without any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward session manager with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It does not perform any harmful actions, data exfiltration, or backdoor activities. It is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
