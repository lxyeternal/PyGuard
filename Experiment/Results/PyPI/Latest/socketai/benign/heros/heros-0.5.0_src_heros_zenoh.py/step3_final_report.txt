  "purpose": "Manage Zenoh sessions with creation, release, configuration updates, and cleanup.",
  "sources": "Configuration dictionary in __init__, internal method calls, json.dumps() on config values before insert_json5",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; configuration data is internally supplied",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from self._config_dict to zenoh.Config via insert_json5; session creation and release manage internal state",
  "anomalies": "Use of json.dumps() on config values before insert_json5 is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code manages sessions via a singleton pattern with reference counting, proper cleanup with atexit, and configuration updates. No external input is processed, and no suspicious network activity or data leaks are present. The use of json.dumps() on config values is unconventional but benign. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The resource management appears correct, and the code structure is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured session manager with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified given the absence of external inputs, secrets, or malicious patterns. All reports' scores are consistent with this analysis.",
