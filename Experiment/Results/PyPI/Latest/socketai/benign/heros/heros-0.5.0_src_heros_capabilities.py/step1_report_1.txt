{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures and utility functions for representing and converting various capabilities, parameters, and annotations used in a remote object or API system.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function signatures (inspect.signature), dictionaries (from_dict methods), and class attributes. It also accesses function names and annotations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted data (e.g., from dictionaries or external sources) are improperly used, but the code does not perform any network operations or data output. No apparent sinks exist that could lead to data exfiltration or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input data from external sources (dictionaries or function signatures) flows into object instantiation and attribute setting, then potentially back into dictionaries for serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior, are present. The code is primarily data structure definitions with straightforward conversion methods. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides classes for representing parameters and capabilities, with methods for serializing/deserializing and extracting information from functions. It uses standard Python libraries and best practices without any suspicious patterns. No network or system-level operations are performed. All functions and methods are standard data processing routines, and the overall structure is typical for defining API schemas or remote procedure capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured implementation for capability and parameter management. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. It does not contain obfuscated or suspicious code segments. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero.",
