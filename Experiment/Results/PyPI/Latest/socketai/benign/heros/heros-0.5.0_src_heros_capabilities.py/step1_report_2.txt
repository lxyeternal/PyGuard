{
  "purpose": "Define data structures and utilities for representing capabilities, parameters, and methods, likely for remote object or API interaction.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports (dataclasses, inspect, typing, types); no external input reading; no user input or external data sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks for untrusted data or dangerous operations. No network, file, or system commands are executed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; code primarily constructs and manipulates in-memory data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. The code appears to be well-structured and typical for defining capabilities and parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes to model parameters and capabilities with methods for serialization/deserialization. Uses standard library features like inspect and dataclasses. No external inputs are processed, and no dynamic code execution or system calls are present. No hardcoded credentials, network communication, or other malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward implementation of data models and utilities for managing capability definitions, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is likely part of a larger system for remote object management or API description. The code is benign and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious behaviors.",
