{
  "purpose": "Define data structures and methods for handling capabilities and parameters, including serialization/deserialization and method signature generation.",
  "sources": "Code reads its own definitions, inspect signatures, class attributes, and default values.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data affects external systems; serialization/deserialization might process external input but no direct harmful operations.",
  "flows": "Data is transformed from dictionaries and class attributes to objects and back, with no external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Usage of inspect and dynamic signature creation is standard for reflective operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines classes for capabilities and parameters, with methods for converting between dicts, signatures, and objects. It uses inspect to analyze function signatures and generate method capabilities. No code injections, network operations, or harmful behaviors are present. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious manipulations. Overall, it appears to be a utility module for capability management with standard reflection techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of capability and parameter data structures with serialization and signature utilities. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on its content. It is safe for use.",
