  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 assigned in some reports slightly overstates the risk but remains conservative. The malware score is correctly 0. Given the analysis, the code is safe for use, and the scores are appropriate."
