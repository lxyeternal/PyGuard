{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for marking and checking attributes on callables, likely for categorization or behavior control within a larger system.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines functions and constants, does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the functions are primarily used for setting and getting attributes on callables.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and primarily utility-based, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants representing attribute names and provides functions to mark callables with these attributes and check for their presence. The functions `_mark` and `_is_marked` abstract attribute setting and checking, respectively. Several specific marker functions are defined for marking callables as hero events, hero methods, local-only, or force remote. The code is clean, well-documented, and does not perform any operations that could be exploited for malicious purposes. There are no input/output operations, network calls, or data processing beyond attribute manipulation. The design appears intended for internal use to categorize functions based on custom attributes. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple attribute marker utility, used for tagging and identifying callables with specific flags. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security risks. It appears safe and intended for internal categorization purposes only.",
