{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators and utility functions for marking and checking specific attributes on callables, primarily for categorizing functions as hero events, methods, or location constraints.",
  "sources": "The code reads the input in the form of callable functions passed to the decorators and check functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that execute or evaluate untrusted data, nor do they perform network I/O or access sensitive system components.",
  "flows": "The functions assign attributes to callables and check for these attributes, which is straightforward and does not involve data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code exclusively deals with marking functions via attributes, with no suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated behavior. No data leaks, malicious injections, or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for attribute names and utility functions for marking and checking callables with these attributes. Marking is done by setting attributes, and checking involves reading these attributes. The implementation is simple and explicit, designed for debugging or categorization purposes. There is no evidence of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code execution vulnerabilities. The code is well-structured and maintains transparency, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for tagging functions with specific roles or constraints, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs straightforward attribute assignment and checks, with no harmful side effects.",
