  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines constants for attribute names related to \"hero\" events, methods, and location constraints.\n- Provides utility functions to mark callables with these attributes (`_mark`, `mark_*`) and to check for these attributes (`_is_marked`, `is_*`).\n- The marking functions are simple decorators or functions that set attributes on callables.\n- The checking functions verify if a callable has a specific attribute.\n\n**Overall impression:**\n- The code is straightforward, clean, well-documented, and designed for internal tagging.\n- No external data handling, no code injection, no network activity.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or hidden behaviors.\n- The purpose appears to be internal categorization or permission tagging.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1-5:**\n- All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, utility-based, and free of malware or security risks.\n- They note the absence of external data flows, suspicious logic, or obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned are:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**\n\nYes. The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or that are inherently risky. It merely sets and checks attributes on functions, which is a benign operation.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Presence of malware or malicious behavior:** None detected. The code does not execute untrusted code, handle external input, or perform network operations.\n- **Obfuscation:** None. The code is explicit and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** None. No vulnerabilities or exploitable behaviors are evident.\n- **Potential for misuse:** While theoretically, someone could misuse the tagging system internally, it does not pose a security threat on its own.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious intent or payload.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and transparent.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- Could misuse of the attribute system cause security issues? Unlikely, unless the larger system interprets these attributes insecurely. But based solely on this code, no.\n- Are there any hidden behaviors? No.\n- Is there any reason to assign a higher risk? No, because the code's purpose is internal tagging, and it does not perform any risky operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|--------|\n| **0**     | **0**        | **0**  |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways consider the context in which this code is used. If the larger system interprets these attributes insecurely or exposes them externally, risks could arise. But based solely on this snippet, it is safe.",
