{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions to mark and check certain attributes (such as hero_event, hero_method, local_only, force_remote) on callables, likely for use in a larger framework or system to identify behavior or roles of functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only manipulates function objects by setting and checking attributes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks for untrusted data or external communication; all operations are confined to setting and checking function attributes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to dangerous sinks exists in this code. It merely marks and inspects attributes on functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, well-documented, and uses attribute setting/checking on functions. No obfuscation, hidden code, or unusual patterns are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The functions `_mark` and `_is_marked` abstract the process of setting and checking custom attributes on callables. The specific marker functions (e.g., `mark_hero_event`, `is_hero_event`) are simple wrappers. The code appears to serve as a tagging system for functions within a larger framework. It does not execute external code, does not handle untrusted input, nor does it perform any dangerous operations. All operations are purely metadata manipulations. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware-like activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for marking and identifying functions based on custom attributes. It does not contain malicious intent or security risks. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
