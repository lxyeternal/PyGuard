{
  "purpose": "The code defines utility functions to mark and check specific attributes on callables, used for categorizing or flagging functions with certain roles or behaviors such as hero events, methods, local-only, or force remote.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function arguments when marking or checking attributes, specifically the 'func' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The code sets or gets attributes on functions; potential risks could involve misuse of these markers, but no external data or untrusted input handling is present.",
  "flows": "Functions mark functions by setting attributes; other functions check these attributes to determine their state. No external data flow or untrusted input processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward, defining and checking attributes on functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility module for marking functions with specific roles via attributes. It includes simple helper functions to mark and verify these attributes. There are no code injection points, external data inputs, or network operations. The functions are standard decorators and attribute checkers. The logic appears benign and primarily for internal categorization of functions. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The code structure is clean, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for marking and identifying function roles, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply manipulates function attributes for internal logic purposes.",
