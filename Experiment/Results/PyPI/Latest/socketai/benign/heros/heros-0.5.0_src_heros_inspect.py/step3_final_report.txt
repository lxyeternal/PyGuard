  "purpose": "Utility functions for marking and checking attributes on callables to categorize their roles (e.g., hero_event, hero_method, local_only, force_remote).",
  "sources": "Functions that set attributes on callables (_mark, mark_* functions).",
  "sinks": "Attribute accessors (_is_marked, is_* functions) checking for specific markers on callables.",
  "flows": "Mark functions assign attributes to callables; check functions read these attributes to determine roles.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; straightforward attribute manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple, well-documented utility functions for tagging functions with specific attributes and checking for these tags. It does not handle external data, perform network operations, or execute untrusted code. The functions are purely for internal categorization, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. The code's operations are transparent and standard for internal tagging mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for internal function tagging, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with its functionality.",
