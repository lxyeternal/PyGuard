{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to mark and check certain attributes on callables, likely for categorization or permission purposes within a larger system.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read by this code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks, code execution, or other vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The flow involves marking functions with specific attributes and checking those attributes later. No untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are detected. The code uses straightforward attribute setting and checking functions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple utility functions for marking callables with specific string attributes and checking for these attributes. The marking functions assign attributes to functions, and the checking functions verify if those attributes are present. The code appears to be for internal use to categorize functions, possibly in a plugin or event system. No external inputs, data, or risky operations are involved. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for function categorization. It does not contain malware, security risks, or suspicious behaviors. The purpose seems to be for internal tagging and inspection of functions within a larger system, with no evident security concerns.",
