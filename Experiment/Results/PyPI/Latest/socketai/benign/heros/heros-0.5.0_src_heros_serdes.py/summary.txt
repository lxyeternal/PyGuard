  "conclusion": "The code is a standard serialization/deserialization utility supporting complex objects and remote references. It does not contain malicious code but presents a moderate security risk if untrusted data is deserialized, primarily due to the use of getattr on remote objects. Proper validation, sandboxing, or strict data validation is recommended when handling untrusted inputs. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly 0; the security risk score should be adjusted to 0.5 to reflect the potential exploitation vector."
