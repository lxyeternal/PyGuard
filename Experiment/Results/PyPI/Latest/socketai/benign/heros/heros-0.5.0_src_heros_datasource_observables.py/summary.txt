  "conclusion": "The main security issue is the use of eval() in lambdify(), which can execute arbitrary code if the input expression is malicious. No malware or obfuscation is present. The security risk should be rated high (around 0.7–0.75) due to the potential for code injection. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0. Recommendations include replacing eval() with safer parsing methods or validating inputs to prevent exploitation."
