  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate HERO management framework over Zenoh, with no signs of malicious behavior. The primary security risk stems from deserialization of untrusted data, which could be exploited if payloads are malicious. However, the code itself does not contain malicious payloads or sabotage. The risk is moderate, primarily due to lack of input validation, but overall the code appears intended for legitimate remote object management."
