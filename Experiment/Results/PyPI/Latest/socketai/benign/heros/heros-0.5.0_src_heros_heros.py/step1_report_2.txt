{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and methods for HERO communication, discovery, and management over a zenoh backend, enabling remote and local HERO interactions and monitoring.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from method parameters, environmental context (e.g., zenoh selectors, payloads), and network responses via zenoh sessions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points include the _query_selector and _query_endpoint methods where data is deserialized, processed, and possibly exposed via callbacks or query replies. Also, in _serialize and _deserialize functions that handle data transmission.",
  "flows": "Data flows from network replies to deserialization (_query_selector), then to callbacks or method executions, and back via query replies or event subscriptions; capabilities are dynamically mapped to remote calls and event handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are visible. No suspicious or malicious code patterns like system commands, file access, or network exfiltration. Usage of dynamic class creation for RemoteHERO is noted but is a legitimate pattern here. No obfuscated code detected. The presence of detailed exception handling and logging is standard. No backdoors or hidden malicious logic evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured, focusing on HERO discovery, remote interaction, and event handling over zenoh. It serializes and deserializes data, manages subscriptions, and dynamically maps remote capabilities. No signs of malicious behavior such as data theft, system modification, or covert channels are present. The methods for callbacks and queryable declarations are typical for such frameworks. The code does handle network communication and remote procedure calls, but these are aligned with its purpose and do not appear malicious. The dynamic creation of classes and method capabilities is legitimate and necessary for remote interactions. The code lacks any hardcoded secrets, unusual obfuscation, or hidden payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a HERO management framework over zenoh, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard patterns for remote procedure calls, event subscriptions, and object discovery. Overall, it is a secure, purpose-driven codebase with no suspicious behaviors detected.",
