{
  "purpose": "This module initializes the package by importing various machine learning models, metrics, and optimizers for use in the library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported classes and functions within the package modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external input or output data directly.",
  "flows": "The code flows from module import statements to the package namespace, with no data processing or external data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward and standard for a package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import aggregator for models, metrics, and optimizers, with no embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The reports are empty, providing no evidence of issues. The code does not perform any data handling, dynamic execution, or network activity. Given the lack of any claims or detailed findings, the overall security posture appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initializer with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The empty reports do not indicate any issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is minimal, reflecting the safe and straightforward nature of the code.",
