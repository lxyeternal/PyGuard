  "purpose": "This code provides functions to calculate various statistical metrics for evaluating machine learning model performance, such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, root mean squared error, R-squared, and adjusted R-squared.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the function parameters y_true, y_pred, n, and p, which are used to perform calculations on provided datasets and parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data beyond mathematical computations; no data is sent over networks or written to files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs (y_true, y_pred, n, p) into calculations for statistical metrics, with intermediate arrays created via numpy functions, ending with returned numerical scores.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution are present. Usage of numpy is standard for numerical calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions utilizing numpy for mathematical operations on input arrays. The inputs are standard datasets and parameters for statistical calculations. No external data sources, network communications, or potentially malicious patterns are evident. The functions perform standard error and score calculations common in machine learning evaluation, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a straightforward implementation of statistical evaluation metrics for machine learning models. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
