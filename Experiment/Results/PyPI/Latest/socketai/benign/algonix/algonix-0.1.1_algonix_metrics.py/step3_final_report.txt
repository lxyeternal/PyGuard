{
  "purpose": "Provides statistical evaluation metrics for model performance, including MSE, MAE, RMSE, R2, and adjusted R2.",
  "sources": "Input parameters y_true, y_pred, n, p; data read from function arguments.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data exfiltration points; computations are internal and purely mathematical.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through numpy operations to output metrics within each function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code constructs detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements common statistical metrics using numpy, with clear data flow and no external system interactions. All functions operate on passed parameters, performing standard calculations. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is benign, and the implementation is correct and well-structured. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of statistical evaluation functions with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is effectively zero. All reports' assessments and scores are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
