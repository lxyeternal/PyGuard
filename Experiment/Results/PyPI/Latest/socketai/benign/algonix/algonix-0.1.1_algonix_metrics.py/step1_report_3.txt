{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to compute various regression evaluation metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, root mean squared error, R-squared, and adjusted R-squared.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters y_true, y_pred, n, and p, which are used as data inputs for the metric calculations.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit data externally, nor does it invoke functions or APIs that could lead to data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input data (y_true, y_pred, n, p) is processed through mathematical operations within functions to compute statistical metrics; no external data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present. Usage of numpy for calculations is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple standard regression metric functions using numpy for calculations. It performs mathematical operations such as mean, sum, difference, and square root. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. All functions operate on parameters passed explicitly; no external or hidden data manipulation occurs. The code appears straightforward and intended solely for statistical calculations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of common statistical functions for regression analysis with no malicious intent detected. It shows no signs of malware or malicious behavior, and security risks are minimal.",
