{
  "purpose": "The code implements various statistical error metrics for evaluating model predictions, such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, root mean squared error, R-squared, and adjusted R-squared.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through function parameters: y_true, y_pred, n, p.",
  "sinks": "The code performs calculations internally; no external data sinks or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs (y_true, y_pred, n, p) through numpy array operations to the return values of each metric function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present. All operations are straightforward mathematical calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy for numerical computations and defines functions for statistical error metrics. Each function processes input arrays or values, performs mathematical operations, and returns scalar metrics. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious patterns. The use of numpy is standard for numerical operations, and all functions serve common statistical purposes. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign implementation of error metric functions commonly used in machine learning evaluations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It solely performs statistical calculations with standard libraries.",
