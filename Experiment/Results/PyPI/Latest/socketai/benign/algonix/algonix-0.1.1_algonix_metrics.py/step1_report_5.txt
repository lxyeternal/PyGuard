{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to calculate various statistical metrics for model evaluation, such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, root mean squared error, R^2 score, and adjusted R^2 score.",
  "sources": "np (numpy library) imported at the beginning, used throughout the code to perform mathematical operations and array manipulations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network communication, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (y_true, y_pred, n, p) flows into functions which perform calculations using numpy functions; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward mathematical functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy for numerical computations and defines functions to compute error metrics and R^2 scores. All calculations use numpy arrays and standard mathematical operations. There are no signs of malicious code, external data handling, or obfuscation. The functions are typical for model evaluation and do not contain any hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of statistical evaluation functions with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
