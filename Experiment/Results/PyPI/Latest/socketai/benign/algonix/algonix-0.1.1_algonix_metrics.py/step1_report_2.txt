{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to compute various statistical metrics for evaluating predictive models, such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, root mean squared error, R-squared, and adjusted R-squared.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through function parameters: y_true, y_pred, n, and p.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions perform unsafe operations, system calls, network connections, or write data to external sources. No sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (sources) through calculations to return the computed metrics; no untrusted data is used in a dangerous context.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy for numerical operations and defines functions for model evaluation metrics. All data processing involves only safe, standard mathematical operations on provided input arguments. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or external communications. The functions do not invoke external systems, execute dynamic code, or handle sensitive credentials. The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for statistical analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious utility for computing statistical metrics. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior, and there are no security concerns based on the provided content.",
