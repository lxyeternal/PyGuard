There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or very low) are consistent with the analysis and appropriate given the benign nature of the code."

Scores are appropriate, with minor room for adjusting confidence and risk levels to better match the absence of code or suspicious activity. Overall, the dependency appears benign, and the security posture is low risk."
