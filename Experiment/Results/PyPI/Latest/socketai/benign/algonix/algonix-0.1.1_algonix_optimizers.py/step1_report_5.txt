  "purpose": "Implementation of gradient descent algorithms (batch and stochastic) for linear regression optimization.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the parameters X and y provided to the optimize methods.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities are present; no external data is transmitted or executed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (X, y) through calculations to the returned optimized weights and bias.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code appears to be straightforward mathematical optimization routines.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes for gradient-based optimization: batch and stochastic. Both use numpy for matrix operations, reading input data via function parameters. There are no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The methods perform standard gradient descent steps for linear regression, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The code does not include any backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious side effects. It solely implements mathematical algorithms for model training.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of linear regression optimization algorithms using gradient descent. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is detected. The code is safe and performs as expected for mathematical model training.",
