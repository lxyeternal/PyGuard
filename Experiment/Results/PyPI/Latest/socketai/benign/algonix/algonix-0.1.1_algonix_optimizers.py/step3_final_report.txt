  "purpose": "Implementation of gradient descent algorithms (batch and stochastic) for linear regression optimization.",
  "sources": "Input data X and target y used for training; model parameters weights and bias read and updated during optimization.",
  "sinks": "Updated weights and bias; no external data or network communication present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input X and y through predictions to error calculation, then to gradient updates, which modify weights and bias.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard gradient descent routines for linear regression, using numpy for numerical operations. No external data sources, network activity, or malicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward, with clear variable usage and no obfuscation. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The logic aligns with typical implementations, and no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of gradient descent algorithms for linear regression. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or very low) are consistent with the analysis and appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
