  "purpose": "Implementations of gradient descent algorithms for optimizing weights in machine learning models, specifically batch and stochastic gradient descent.",
  "sources": "Import of numpy library for numerical computations.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data leakage, system modification, or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input features X and labels y into the optimize methods, where calculations are performed locally; no external data flow or network communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses standard gradient descent algorithms with typical implementations. No obfuscation or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two classes implementing gradient descent optimization techniques for machine learning models. Both classes perform iterative parameter updates based on input data, with no external data fetching, storage, or network communication. The libraries used are standard scientific libraries for numerical computation. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of common algorithms, with no hidden or malicious instructions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign implementation of gradient descent algorithms without malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical machine learning optimization routines without any suspicious behaviors or security vulnerabilities.",
