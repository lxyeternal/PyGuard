  "purpose": "Implementations of gradient descent optimization algorithms for linear regression models.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the parameters X and y provided to the optimize methods.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions; no external data transmission or harmful system modifications present.",
  "flows": "Input data (X, y) flows through the prediction and error calculations during optimization; no external outputs or network activities observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or unusual functions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes implementing gradient descent algorithms for linear regression. It performs standard calculations of predictions, errors, and weight updates using numpy operations. There are no external data transmissions, no code injections, and no suspicious behaviors. All operations are confined to mathematical computations on input data, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of gradient descent algorithms for linear models with no signs of malicious or sabotage activity. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior, no external communications, and no hidden backdoors. The overall security risk is minimal.",
