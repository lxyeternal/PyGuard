  "purpose": "Implementation of gradient descent algorithms for optimizing linear regression models.",
  "sources": "Reads input data matrices X and y, and model parameters (weights, bias).",
  "sinks": "Outputs updated weights and bias; no evident data leaks or untrusted outputs.",
  "flows": "Inputs (X, y) -> calculations (predictions, errors) -> updates (weights, bias).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or unusual code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard implementations of batch and stochastic gradient descent algorithms. It performs matrix operations to compute gradients and updates model parameters iteratively. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious data manipulation. The code uses NumPy for mathematical operations, which is common in numerical computations. No data leakage mechanisms, external data transfers, or security-sensitive functions are present. The code appears to be straightforward, well-structured, and consistent with typical gradient descent implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of gradient descent algorithms without any malicious intent or security risks.",
