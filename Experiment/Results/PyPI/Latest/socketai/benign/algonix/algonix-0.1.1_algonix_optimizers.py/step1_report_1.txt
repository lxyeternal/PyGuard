  "purpose": "The code implements two classes for gradient descent optimization algorithms (batch and stochastic) for linear regression.",
  "sources": "Reads input data matrices X and y, and parameters weights and bias from function arguments.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (X, y) through calculations to output weights and bias updates; no external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. No obfuscation or malicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward implementation of common algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes for gradient descent optimization: batch (GradientDescent) and stochastic (StochasticGradientDescent). Each class initializes with learning rate and iteration count. The optimize methods perform iterative updates on weights and bias based on input data, following standard formulas for gradient descent. No external data sources, network activity, or suspicious operations are present. The code is well-structured, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. All operations are typical for machine learning model training.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of gradient descent algorithms for linear regression without any malicious behavior or security issues detected. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
