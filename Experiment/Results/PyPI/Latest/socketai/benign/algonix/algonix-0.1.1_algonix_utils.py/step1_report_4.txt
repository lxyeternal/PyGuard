  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python script performing some data processing or utility functions. No explicit malicious intent is evident.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly shown; no obvious input reading functions or data sources like files, environment variables, or network inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include print statements or data writes, but none are present. No network calls, file modifications, or sensitive data exfiltration points are visible.",
  "flows": "There are no apparent source-to-sink data flows. The code mainly consists of definitions and straightforward logic without untrusted data paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are observed. The code structure is typical and clear.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard function definitions, variable assignments, and control flow. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated segments, or suspicious imports are present. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this module.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility or application component with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
