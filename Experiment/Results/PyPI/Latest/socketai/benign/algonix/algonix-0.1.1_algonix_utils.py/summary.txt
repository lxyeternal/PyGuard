  "conclusion": "The reports are well-aligned with the code content, showing no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Scores are appropriate, with minor room for adjusting confidence and risk levels to better match the absence of code or suspicious activity. Overall, the dependency appears benign, and the security posture is low risk."
