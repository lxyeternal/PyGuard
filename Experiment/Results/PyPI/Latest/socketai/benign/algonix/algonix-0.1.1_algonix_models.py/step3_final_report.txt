  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python ML code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "In-memory data processing, standard library functions, plotting, and parameter initialization.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or file operations detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through model computations without external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard ML algorithms (linear regression, logistic regression, clustering, decision trees, ensemble methods) implemented with common libraries like numpy and sklearn. No network calls, no hidden code, and no obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the use of randomness in clustering, which is standard. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free from malicious intent. The security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. Minor security risk scores (~0.1) in some reports are justified but could be lowered to zero for accuracy. Overall, the dependency is safe.",
