  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free from malicious intent. The security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. Minor security risk scores (~0.1) in some reports are justified but could be lowered to zero for accuracy. Overall, the dependency is safe."
