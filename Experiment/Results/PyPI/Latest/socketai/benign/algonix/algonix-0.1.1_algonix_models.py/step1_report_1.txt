  "purpose": "Implementation of various regression, classification, clustering, and model selection algorithms in Python for machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data during fit and predict methods, primarily from function parameters and data structures passed into methods.",
  "sinks": "Predictions returned by predict methods; no evidence of data leakage or insecure data handling points observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through model computations to output predictions; no suspicious data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no hidden network activity, and no unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard implementations of common machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, logistic regression, ridge and lasso, decision trees, KNN, KMeans, and gradient boosting. All data operations appear to be confined to in-memory data structures, with no external data exfiltration, network calls, or use of sensitive environment variables. No malicious or sabotage behaviors such as backdoors, hidden network communications, or malicious file operations are evident. Use of random sampling in KMeans is standard; no suspicious randomness or seed manipulation is observed. The code does not manipulate system files, invoke shell commands, or perform any suspicious I/O. Overall, the code appears to be standard, academic or industrial ML implementations without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code consists of standard machine learning algorithm implementations with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs in-memory data processing and model training/prediction tasks typical of open-source ML libraries. No malicious or sabotage features are detected.",
