  "purpose": "Implementation of various regression and classification algorithms, including linear, logistic, ridge, lasso, decision trees, k-NN, k-means clustering, and gradient boosting.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters (X, y), and in some classes, reads data for fitting and predicting processes.",
  "sinks": "Outputs predictions, plots, and metrics such as accuracy and mean squared error. No evident data leaks or external data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to model fitting and prediction methods; no untrusted data sources or external network communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code or unusual code constructs. Plot functions and print statements are standard for visualization and debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple machine learning models implemented in a straightforward manner, utilizing numpy and scikit-learn. There are no signs of malicious data handling, network activity, or code that could be used maliciously. The code performs common machine learning tasks with standard practices. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious data leaks are present. The plotting functions and print statements are typical for analysis workflows. All methods seem to follow their respective algorithms without hidden or malicious modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of standard machine learning algorithms without any malicious or sabotage-related behavior. It appears safe for use, serving as a typical ML library implementation. No malicious intent or security risks detected.",
