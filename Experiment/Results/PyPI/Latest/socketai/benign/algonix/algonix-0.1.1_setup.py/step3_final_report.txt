  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() function, including package info, dependencies, author details, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static configuration without dynamic or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools to specify package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It contains only static, hardcoded information with no dynamic code execution, external data reads, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. There are no signs of hidden malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is a standard, benign package configuration file with no security concerns or malicious elements. The reports accurately reflect this, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
