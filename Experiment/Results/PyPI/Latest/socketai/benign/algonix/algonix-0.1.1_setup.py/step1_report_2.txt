{
  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for the 'algonix' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads static package metadata (name, version, author, description, URL, classifiers, python_requires) and dependencies listed in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or environment variable modifications are present.",
  "flows": "The code does not process or pass untrusted input; it only declares static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from 'setuptools' to configure the package. It sets package metadata (name, version, author info, description, URL), specifies dependencies in 'install_requires', and includes classifiers to categorize the package. All data are static and hardcoded, typical for setup scripts. No external input, user data, or dynamic execution is involved. The code performs a standard package setup configuration without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious activity, and no security risks. It is safe to use and deploy.",
