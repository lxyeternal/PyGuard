{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'algonix' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static data defined in the setup() function parameters; no external data inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external untrusted sources or outputs; no untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; the code only defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, author info, and classifiers. All elements are static and typical for Python package setup files. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network calls, dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. No external data sources are read or written, and the code does not include any logic beyond package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project with no malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file.",
