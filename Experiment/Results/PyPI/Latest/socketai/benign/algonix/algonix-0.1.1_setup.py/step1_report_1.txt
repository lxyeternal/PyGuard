{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'algonix' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and package details.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata from the script itself, including package name, version, dependencies, author info, description, URL, classifiers, and Python version requirement.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions. It mainly prepares package information for distribution.",
  "flows": "The data flows from static configuration variables into the setup() function, which processes this data to prepare package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and typical of a setup script.",
  "analysis": "This is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. It specifies package metadata and dependencies without executing any dynamic or external code. No hardcoded credentials, external data reads, or malicious logic are present. The script solely defines package info and requirements, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal, benign setup configuration for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
