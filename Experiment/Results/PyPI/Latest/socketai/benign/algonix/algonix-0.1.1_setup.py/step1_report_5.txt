  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for the 'algonix' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data for package metadata, dependencies, and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or input sources; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic data flows; static data is used for configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or hidden behaviors detected. The code follows standard package setup practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for package configuration and calls 'setup()' with predefined arguments. All information is hardcoded and there are no external input sources or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, code injection, or secret handling. The code appears to be a typical, legitimate package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward package setup configuration with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
