  "purpose": "Utility functions for string manipulation, URL encoding, timestamp generation, JSON serialization, variable resolution, and XML property extraction within a larger system.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as xml_file_path, strings for replacement, concatenation, and URL encoding, environment variables, and configuration dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Execution of system commands via os.system() for HDFS file retrieval, potential reading of external XML files, and data serialization functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., xml_file_path) flow into os.system() calls for file fetching; configuration strings flow into functions like replace_all, append_all, concat, and resolve_variables; data is read from files and parsed into properties.",
  "anomalies": "The trim() function appends '.strip()' as a string instead of calling the method; use of os.system() with external inputs without sanitization; to_json_str, to_properties_str, and to_configuration_str functions do not serialize data properly, possibly incomplete.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions with straightforward logic. The main security concern is the use of os.system() to fetch files from HDFS without input validation, which could lead to command injection if xml_file_path is controlled by an attacker. The trim() function is incorrectly implemented, which is a bug rather than malicious. No signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The functions are generally safe if inputs are sanitized, but the potential for exploitation exists due to unsafe system calls. The malware and obfuscated scores are zero, reflecting the absence of malicious code. The security risk score is moderate (~0.35-0.4) due to the unsafe execution pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily benign utility functions with a notable security concern regarding the unsafe use of os.system() for fetching files from HDFS, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. The faulty trim() implementation is a bug, not malicious. No malware or obfuscation is detected. To improve security, input validation and safer command execution methods are recommended.",
