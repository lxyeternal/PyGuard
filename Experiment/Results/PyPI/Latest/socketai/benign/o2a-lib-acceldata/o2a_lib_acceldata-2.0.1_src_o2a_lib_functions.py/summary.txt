  "conclusion": "The code is primarily benign utility functions with a notable security concern regarding the unsafe use of os.system() for fetching files from HDFS, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. The faulty trim() implementation is a bug, not malicious. No malware or obfuscation is detected. To improve security, input validation and safer command execution methods are recommended."
