{
  "purpose": "This module provides tools for translating Expression Language (EL) to Jinja templates, including parsing, syntax translation, and variable substitution.",
  "sources": "Reads input expressions to parse and translate EL syntax; accesses constants, functions, and parameters during translation.",
  "sinks": "Uses evaluate_function for function invocation translation; modifies token values and generates string code for variables, functions, and expressions.",
  "flows": "Input expression -> Parsing -> Token and tree analysis -> Variable/constant resolution or function translation -> Output string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious hardcoded IPs or domains; use of regex for parsing appears standard; the code mainly focuses on translation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs parsing of EL syntax, converting it into equivalent Jinja syntax, with functions for token translation, operator mapping, and variable handling. It translates constants, function calls, and operators, maintaining syntactic correctness. The _translate_el function manages source-to-sink translation, while _convert_variables_to_params_get enhances variable safety. There are no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious system interactions. It employs standard libraries (re, typing) and a third-party parser (lark) with no suspicious external network activity or code injection points. The core logic is for translation and variable resolution, not for data exfiltration or malicious control.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward translation utility for EL to Jinja, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It handles parsing, syntax translation, and safe variable substitution without external or covert communications. No malware or security risks are detected.",
