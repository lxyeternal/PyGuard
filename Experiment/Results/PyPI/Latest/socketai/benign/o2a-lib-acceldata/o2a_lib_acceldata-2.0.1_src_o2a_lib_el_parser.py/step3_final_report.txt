{
  "purpose": "This module translates Expression Language (EL) syntax into Jinja templates, parsing EL expressions and converting them into safe, executable Jinja code.",
  "sources": "Input EL expressions provided as strings to the translate function, which are parsed by the Lark parser into an AST.",
  "sinks": "Variable substitution via regex replacing variables with params.get(), and the evaluate_function call within _translate_function.",
  "flows": "Input expression -> parsing into AST -> translation functions process AST nodes -> variable substitution or function invocation -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation or hidden code; reliance on external evaluate_function which could execute arbitrary code if malicious, but no evidence here.",
  "analysis": "The code performs syntactic parsing of EL expressions, translating operators, functions, and variables into Jinja syntax. Variable substitution is handled via regex, wrapping variables with params.get(). The evaluate_function is an external dependency that could pose a risk if malicious, but no malicious code or obfuscation is present. The code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The main security concern is trusting evaluate_function, but as provided, no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate EL to Jinja translation utility with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The primary risk stems from the external evaluate_function, which could be malicious if untrusted. Overall, the code is low risk, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a security risk score of 0.2 due to external dependency reliance.",
