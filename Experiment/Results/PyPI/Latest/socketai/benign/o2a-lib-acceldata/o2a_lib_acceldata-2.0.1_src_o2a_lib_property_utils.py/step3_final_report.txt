  "purpose": "A utility class for managing and merging property dictionaries with XML escaping for safe output.",
  "sources": "Input dictionaries and lists provided during initialization, such as job_properties, config, action_node_properties, and action_node_paths.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is processed internally with escaping for XML safety.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into class attributes, then optionally through xml_escaped for sanitization, and merged for combined properties.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard use of escape function for XML sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data container class with methods for deep copying with XML escaping and merging properties. It relies on standard libraries and performs no network, file, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The data flow is internal and safe, with proper type hints and clear structure. The use of escape is appropriate for XML safety, not malicious intent. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and very low security risks (0 or 0.1). The code's logic is simple, safe, and standard for property management tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for managing properties with XML escaping. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores across reports are accurate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
