The faulty trim() implementation is a bug, not malicious. No malware or obfuscation is detected. To improve security, input validation and safer command execution methods are recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code is not malicious but contains a significant security vulnerability related to command injection due to passing unvalidated input strings directly to subprocess. No malware or obfuscation is detected. The primary concern is the unsafe execution pattern, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. The overall malware and obfuscation scores are zero; the security risk score should be set at approximately 0.75 to reflect the potential for exploitation."
