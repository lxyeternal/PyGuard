  "purpose": "The code appears to be a header comment block for a Python script, likely related to an Airflow DAG, providing licensing and copyright information.",
  "sources": "No active data input sources are present in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow is present in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely comments and licensing information with no executable logic or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments and a brief note about Airflow DAG import requirements. There are no actual code statements, data reads, or potential data sinks. No malicious or unusual behavior is detectable from comments alone. This is a typical license header block found in open-source projects.",
  "conclusion": "There is no malicious behavior, malware, or security risk present in this code snippet. It is a standard licensing comment block with no executable or suspicious content.",
