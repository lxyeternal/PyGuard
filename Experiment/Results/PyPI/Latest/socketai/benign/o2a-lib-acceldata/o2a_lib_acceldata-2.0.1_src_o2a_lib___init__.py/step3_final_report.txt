  "purpose": "This code contains only licensing comments and a brief note about Airflow DAG import requirements, serving as a header or metadata block.",
  "sources": "Licensing comments, copyright notices, and import notes; no data input or output points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flow or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow; purely static comments.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns; standard licensing header.",
  "analysis": "The code is a non-executable header with licensing info, typical in open-source projects. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the content. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are indicated or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign licensing header with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified given the content.",
