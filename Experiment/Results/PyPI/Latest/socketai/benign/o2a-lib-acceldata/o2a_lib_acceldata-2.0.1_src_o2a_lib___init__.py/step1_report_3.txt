{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a header or boilerplate for a Python script, likely related to an Airflow DAG, with licensing information and copyright notice.",
  "sources": "No input sources are present; no data reading or external input is evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are identifiable due to the absence of executable code or logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only comments and licensing headers with no executable statements, which is unusual for a typical script but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is purely comments and licensing information, with no actual code logic, data handling, or functionality. There are no source, sink, or flow elements. Its structure suggests it is a fragment or header of a larger script, likely a placeholder or file header. No suspicious or malicious activity can be inferred from such content. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is detectable in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, consisting solely of licensing comments and a brief note about Airflow DAG requirements. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in this fragment.",
