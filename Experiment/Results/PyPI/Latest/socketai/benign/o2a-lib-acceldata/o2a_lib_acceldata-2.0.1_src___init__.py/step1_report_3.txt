  "purpose": "Commented header indicating licensing information for an Airflow DAG",
  "sources": "No code reading input or data; only comments and license information",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths as no executable code exists",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code; only licensing comments, no suspicious or unusual code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a brief note about Airflow DAG requirements. No functions, variables, data input/output, or code logic are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The comments reference licensing and copyright, which are standard for open-source files. The mention of 'airflow DAG' is just a note and does not introduce any executable or malicious component.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely comments with licensing information and a note about Airflow DAG import requirements. There is no executable code, no suspicious activity, and no signs of malware or security risks.",
