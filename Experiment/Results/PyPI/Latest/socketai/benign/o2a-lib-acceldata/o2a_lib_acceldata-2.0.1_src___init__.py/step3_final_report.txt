  "purpose": "This code serves as a licensing header and comment indicating requirements for an Airflow DAG, with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "Comments and license text; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only static comments and license info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard licensing comments with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a licensing and comment header with no executable statements, data processing, or logic. It contains no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The absence of data input/output, code execution, or network activity indicates no security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign licensing header with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
