  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing and querying Airflow workflow context, task states, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Context variables, database queries for task instances and DAG run data.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no external data transmission or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from context and database queries to internal processing functions; no external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Placeholder functions with incomplete implementations; no malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions for workflow management, accessing context data, querying the database via ORM, and performing simple data transformations. No external network calls, file operations, or code execution are present. Placeholder functions are incomplete but benign, serving as stubs for future implementation. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected. The functions operate within expected parameters for internal workflow management, with proper exception handling. Given the absence of malicious activity, external threats, or obfuscation, the code appears safe and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of utility functions for Airflow workflows, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. Placeholder functions are incomplete but do not introduce vulnerabilities. The overall security assessment is that this code poses minimal risk and can be considered safe.",
