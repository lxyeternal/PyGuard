  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and dynamic execution.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, function arguments, external data fetches, user inputs, network sockets, files, dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, system commands, dynamic code execution, data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user inputs to sinks like network sockets, files, or dynamic execution points, often via obfuscated or unvalidated paths.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of eval/exec, hardcoded IPs/credentials, suspicious imports, complex control flow, dynamic code execution, lack of code or standard patterns in some reports.",
  "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify benign patterns in Report 1 and 4, with low scores reflecting no malicious activity. Reports 2 and 3 highlight obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common indicators of potential malicious intent, justifying higher malware (0.3-0.4) and obfuscation (0.7) scores. The suspicion is moderate, with no confirmed malicious payloads. Reports 5 lack code for analysis, appropriately scored zero. Overall, the evidence suggests moderate suspicion primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code patterns, but no definitive malicious activity is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits patterns such as obfuscation and dynamic execution that raise suspicion but lack concrete malicious payloads. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. The overall malware score is around 0.4, obfuscation at 0.7, and security risk approximately 0.55, reflecting moderate concern without confirmed malicious activity.",
