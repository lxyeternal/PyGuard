  "conclusion": "The code exhibits patterns such as obfuscation and dynamic execution that raise suspicion but lack concrete malicious payloads. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. The overall malware score is around 0.4, obfuscation at 0.7, and security risk approximately 0.55, reflecting moderate concern without confirmed malicious activity."
