{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, possibly within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from variables or function parameters; no explicit external data sources like files, environment variables, or network inputs are visible.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements, data returned from functions, or operations that could lead to data exposure if untrusted data is used, but no dangerous functions (e.g., eval, exec, or system calls) are detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (parameters or variables) through processing functions, with no evident untrusted data flows leading to insecure or harmful operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL connections, or backdoors are evident. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or dynamic code execution detected. No malicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and appears to perform standard data processing tasks without involving external inputs or dangerous functions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns. The absence of network calls, file manipulations, or environment variable misuse indicates a low likelihood of malicious intent. The code does not access or modify system files or sensitive data. Overall, the code seems benign based on the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be a normal utility script or component without any malicious intent.",
