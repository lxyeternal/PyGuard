  "conclusion": "Most reports accurately reflect their content, with some overestimation of malware potential in the absence of concrete malicious code. The main adjustment is increasing the security risk score for reports involving eval() with untrusted inputs. Overall, the scoring aligns well with the observed patterns, emphasizing cautious interpretation where eval() and obfuscation are present."
