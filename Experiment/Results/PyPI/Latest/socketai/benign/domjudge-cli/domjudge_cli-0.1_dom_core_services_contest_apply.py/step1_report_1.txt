{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a connection to a local contest management API and applies contest configurations, including creating contests, and associating problems and teams with those contests.",
  "sources": "Reads include load_secret('admin_password') for the password, and contest data from config.contests.",
  "sinks": "Uses the DomjudgeAPI client to send contest creation and application data to a local server via HTTP requests.",
  "flows": "Loads secret -> establishes API connection -> creates contest data -> applies problems and teams via API calls.",
  "anomalies": "The password is hardcoded as 'admin' in the API client; sensitive data is loaded via load_secret which is good practice. No obfuscated code or unusual logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code follows a standard pattern of API interaction for contest setup. Sensitive credentials are retrieved securely through load_secret, avoiding hardcoding. The API endpoints appear to be local, reducing external risk. No suspicious or malicious code segments are present. The code does not perform any network operations outside the specified API, nor does it contain backdoors, hidden data exfiltration, or code injection. The structure and data handling are straightforward and aligned with legitimate contest setup functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical contest configuration tasks with secure handling of secrets and no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. The overall risk is low, and no malicious behavior is detected.",
