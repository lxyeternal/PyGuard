{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a contest environment by creating contests, applying problems, and teams via an API client.",
  "sources": "load_secret(\"admin_password\") reads sensitive data from an external secret manager.",
  "sinks": "The retrieved secret is used as a password in the API client; API calls to create contests and apply problems/teams.",
  "flows": "load_secret() → DomjudgeAPI constructor (password) → API calls (create_contest, apply_problems_to_contest, apply_teams_to_contest).",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded username \"admin\"; loading secret directly for password; no validation or encryption of secrets; API endpoint is localhost, which is typical but worth noting.",
  "analysis": "The code reads sensitive credentials via load_secret and uses them in API authentication. The API calls appear standard for contest management. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The secrets are stored externally, which is good practice. No obfuscation or malicious data flows are detected. All operations are straightforward API interactions to set up contests.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard contest setup script with no evident malicious behavior. It securely loads secrets, but the use of hardcoded username and localhost endpoint could be minor security considerations. Overall, it does not exhibit malware or malicious supply chain behavior.",
