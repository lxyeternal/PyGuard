{
  "purpose": "Provides data models and packaging functions for contest problem files, including INI, YAML, data, validators, and submissions, into a ZIP archive.",
  "sources": "Class attributes and methods that read/write data to ZIP files, parsing INI content, and class initializers.",
  "sinks": "Writing data into ZIP files via zf.writestr; no external or untrusted data execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data from class attributes flows into ZIP archive entries through write methods; no external data flow or code execution detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward data serialization and validation.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard data models with pydantic, serializes data into ZIP files, and performs validation on file completeness. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or obfuscation are present. The parsing of INI content is simple and controlled. The write methods serialize data directly, assuming prior validation. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for packaging contest problem data. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security flaws. The low risk score (around 0.1) is justified, assuming external data is sanitized or trusted. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for its purpose.",
