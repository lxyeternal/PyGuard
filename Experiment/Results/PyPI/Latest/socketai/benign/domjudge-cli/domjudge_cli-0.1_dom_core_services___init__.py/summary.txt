  "conclusion": "The dependency shows minimal malicious intent overall, with some signs of obfuscation and dynamic code that warrant monitoring. The current scores are appropriate, but a cautious stance would slightly elevate malware suspicion in Reports 2 and 3. The supply chain appears relatively secure, but further static and dynamic analysis is recommended for confirmation."
