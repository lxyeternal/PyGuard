  "conclusion": "The code is secure, well-structured, and performs its intended functions without malicious behavior. The external 'convert' utility is the only external factor, but in the absence of evidence of maliciousness, the malware score remains 0. The obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low (~0.1-0.2). Overall, the package handling process appears safe and legitimate."
