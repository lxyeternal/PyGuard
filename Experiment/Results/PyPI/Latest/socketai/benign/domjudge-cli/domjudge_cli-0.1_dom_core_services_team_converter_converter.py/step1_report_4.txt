{
  "purpose": "This code loads, converts, and validates problem packages from archives, supporting formats like 'domjudge' and 'polygon', and extracting relevant problem data for further processing.",
  "sources": "Reads include archive files (archive_path), internal ZIP files (via zipfile), text files (domjudge-problem.ini, problem.yaml), and various directory contents (data, submissions, output_validators).",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe data flows into problem data structures and file extractions. No direct sinks like network, system command execution, or sensitive data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from archive files and ZIP extraction (sources) into in-memory models (sinks), with conversion and validation steps in between; no untrusted command execution or network communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code performs standard file handling and parsing. No unusual dynamic code execution or misleading variable usage is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically extracts and loads problem data from archives, converting formats when needed. It validates presence of required files and parses configurations securely with standard libraries. There are no indications of malicious code, external network access, or data exfiltration. The file handling and ZIP extraction are typical for such applications, with proper error handling for missing files. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, secure implementation for loading and converting problem packages with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It relies on safe libraries and performs appropriate validation. No malware or malicious behavior is detected.",
