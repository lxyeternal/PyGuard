{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'domjudge-cli', including its dependencies and entry point for command-line execution.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; standard setup.py configuration files with static data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; the script does not process external data or user input directly.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code only defines package metadata and configuration, no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and follows typical setup.py patterns without suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup functions from setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, and console entry points. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or embedded malicious logic. All dependencies are standard, and no sensitive data, credentials, or system calls are present. The code is a conventional setup configuration for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply specifies package information and dependencies without processing external data or executing any runtime logic.",
