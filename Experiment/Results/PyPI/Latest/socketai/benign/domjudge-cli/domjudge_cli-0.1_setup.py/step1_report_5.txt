  "purpose": "Defines setup configuration for the 'domjudge-cli' Python package, including dependencies and entry point for command-line execution.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools (setup, find_packages), and the setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "N/A, the code is a static configuration script with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded strings are typical for package configuration, no suspicious code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools. It specifies package name, version, packages to include, dependencies, and entry point for CLI. There are no signs of malicious code, no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, nor suspicious behaviors. The dependencies are common, and the code structure is straightforward. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
