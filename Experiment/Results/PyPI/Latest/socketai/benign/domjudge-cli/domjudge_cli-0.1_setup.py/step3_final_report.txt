  "purpose": "Defines package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point for the 'domjudge-cli' Python package.",
  "sources": "Package metadata fields, dependencies, and entry point specification in setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; only configuration data for package installation",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the entry point may invoke external code at runtime",
  "anomalies": "None detected; standard setup script with no obfuscation or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, specifying package info, dependencies, and CLI entry point. It contains no dynamic code, obfuscation, or embedded secrets. The actual executable logic resides in an external module 'dom.cli.__main__', which is outside this script's scope. The setup script itself is benign and follows standard practices. The only potential concern is the entry point executing external code, but this is normal for CLI tools and does not indicate malicious intent within this script.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated code. The primary security consideration is the content of the external 'dom.cli.__main__' module, which is outside this analysis. The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the script, with a very low security risk score reflecting the potential for malicious code in the invoked module, not in the setup script itself.",
