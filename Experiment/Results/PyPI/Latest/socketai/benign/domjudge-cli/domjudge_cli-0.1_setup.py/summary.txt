  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated code. The primary security consideration is the content of the external 'dom.cli.__main__' module, which is outside this analysis. The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the script, with a very low security risk score reflecting the potential for malicious code in the invoked module, not in the setup script itself."
