  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Content:** Confirms that the code is a standard setup script with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the setup script is straightforward, with no signs of malicious code. The confidence is high, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Content:** Similar to Report 1, with added emphasis that the actual executable code resides in 'dom.cli.__main__:main', which is outside this script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The note about potential risk due to the entry point is valid but not a direct security concern in the setup script itself. The script is standard; the actual risk depends on the implementation of the 'main' function, which is outside this scope. The securityRisk score of 0.1 seems reasonable, considering the potential for malicious code in the entry point, but the script itself remains benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Content:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the standard nature of the setup script and that any malicious behavior would depend on the 'dom.cli.__main__:main' module.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The script itself is safe; the potential risk is external. The scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Content:** Reiterates that the script is standard, with no suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; the script is a typical setup configuration.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Content:** Similar to others, confirming the script's standard nature and lack of malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code Presence:** The code is a standard setup.py script with no suspicious or malicious code embedded.\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign malware=0.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign obfuscated=0.\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation, with one report (Report 2) assigning 0.1 due to the entry point potentially executing external code. This is a cautious but reasonable assessment, given that the actual code executed at runtime isn't present here.\n- **Confidence:** Generally high; the reports correctly identify the script as benign.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The only point to consider is whether the securityRisk score should be slightly higher, say 0.1, across all reports, given that the entry point could execute malicious code if the 'dom.cli.__main__' module is compromised. However, since the setup script itself is benign, and the risk depends on external code, the current scores are acceptable.\n\n### Final judgment:\n- The setup script is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The risk primarily hinges on the contents of the 'dom.cli.__main__:main' module, which is outside the scope of this script.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for potential malicious code in the entry point, but the setup script itself remains safe)\n\n**Conclusion:** The setup script is safe, with minimal inherent risk. The main concern is external code execution at runtime, which cannot be assessed here.",
