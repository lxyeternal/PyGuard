  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'domjudge-cli' for distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reading package dependencies (pyyaml, typer), package discovery via find_packages(), and setup configuration data.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; the code strictly sets up package metadata and dependencies without processing user input or external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code follows standard Python package setup practices without suspicious patterns or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools to configure a Python package. It specifies package name, version, packages included, data inclusion, dependencies, and console script entry point. All elements are typical for package distribution. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears safe and legitimate.",
