  "purpose": "Import a function named import_problem from a local module named converter.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import statement, which accesses the local package's converter module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow beyond module import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific function from a local module, which is a standard practice in Python. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage. The code is extremely simple, consisting only of an import statement, and does not perform any actions that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard module import with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
