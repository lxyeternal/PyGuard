  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code presence and correctness**: All reports describe a simple import statement:\n   ```python\n   from .converter import import_problem\n   ```\n   This is a standard Python import syntax for relative modules within a package.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes**: None of the reports identify any errors or flaws in the code. The code is minimal, syntactically correct, and follows typical Python conventions.\n\n3. **Scores assigned**:\n   - **Obfuscated**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - **Malware**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious activity.\n   - **Security risk**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5**: None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a higher risk score. The code is purely an import statement with no dynamic execution, no external data, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations**:\n   - The code only imports a function from a local module; there is no indication of malicious behavior such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n   - The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions**:\n   - All reports correctly avoid speculative claims; they recognize the code's simplicity and benign intent.\n\n7. **Score consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), which is justified given the straightforwardness of the code.\n\n**Overall assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, benign import statement.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risk.\n- The assigned scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear and straightforward code)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code snippet is benign, and there is no need for concern regarding supply chain security here.",
