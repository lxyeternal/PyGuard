  "purpose": "Import the 'import_problem' function or object from a local module named 'converter'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a relative module within the package, specifically 'converter'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code snippet; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The code only performs an import statement; no data flow or execution of untrusted code occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no unusual or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import statement in Python, used to include 'import_problem' from the 'converter' module. It contains no dynamic execution, external data sources, or suspicious behavior. The snippet is very minimal, focusing solely on module importation, which is typical in modular Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a standard part of a larger codebase without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
