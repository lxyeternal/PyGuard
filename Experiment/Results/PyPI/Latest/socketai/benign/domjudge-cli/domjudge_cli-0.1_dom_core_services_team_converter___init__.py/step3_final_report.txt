  "purpose": "To import the function 'import_problem' from a local module named 'converter' within the same package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module 'converter' via a relative import statement.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "The import statement loads 'import_problem' from 'converter' into the current namespace; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import in Python, which is standard practice. It involves no dynamic execution, external data, or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. All indicators support a safe assessment, and no modifications to the scores are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
