  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports describe a single, straightforward import statement: `from .converter import import_problem`. This is a standard Python import pattern for local modules. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are indicated by this code snippet. The reports are consistent in stating that the code is minimal and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are quite thorough and consistent. They correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement with no data flow, external data sources, or suspicious patterns. There are no apparent logical errors or flawed reasoning in their assessments.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign a confidence level of 0.9 or 1, with malware and security risk scores at 0. They are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. Since the code is trivial and does not perform any risky operations, these scores seem reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nAll scores are at or below 0.5, aligning with the absence of any malicious or risky behavior. Therefore, no justification for higher scores is needed.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious activity, and the report descriptions support this.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nThe reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as a benign import statement without any suspicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent across reports and appropriate given the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk present.\n\n### Overall Recommendation:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code snippet, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's characteristics.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and thorough. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements are present in this import statement.",
