  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement; no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement importing 'import_problem' from a module named 'converter' in the same package. This is a standard practice in Python to organize code into modules and does not involve any data handling, user input, or network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
