  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, input functions, file operations, network calls, subprocesses.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, subprocess executions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input functions to sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; minimal or incomplete code snippets.",
  "analysis": "All provided reports indicate minimal or incomplete code with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The malware scores are consistently 0, aligning with the benign assessments. Security risk scores are low (0.2–0.3), reflecting cautious but justified evaluations given limited code context. Confidence levels are appropriate, high where detailed reasoning is provided, very low where code is absent. The scores across reports are coherent and justified based on the descriptions, with no indications of supply chain threats or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code snippets are benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scoring and reasoning are consistent and appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
