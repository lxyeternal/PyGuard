{
  "purpose": "To configure the setup and packaging of the 'snapdroid' Python project, including reading version info, long description, and defining entry points and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading '__version__' from '__init__.py' and long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks where untrusted data flows into dangerous functions or causes security issues.",
  "flows": "Reading data from files ('__init__.py' and 'README.md') with no transformation into executable or network functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Use of regular expressions and file reading is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup configuration tasks: extracting version information with regex, reading a markdown file for description, and configuring package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears straightforward and typical for Python package setup files. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. All operations are static and within the expected scope of a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical package metadata reading and setup tasks without suspicious behaviors.",
