{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'snapdroid' with metadata and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "File reading operations: reading '__init__.py' for version info and 'README.md' for description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the setup process mainly reads static files and defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from source files; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or network.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements. No dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs static file reading to gather package metadata and configure the setup process. It uses regex to extract the version number from a source file, which is a standard practice. The 'setup()' call contains no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of untrusted input. The package metadata appears legitimate and typical for a Python project. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It performs no malicious actions or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
