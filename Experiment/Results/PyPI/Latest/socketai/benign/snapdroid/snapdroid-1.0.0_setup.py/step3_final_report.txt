  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'snapdroid' project, defining metadata, version extraction, and CLI entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'snapdroid/__init__.py' via regex; reads long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Static file reads for version and description; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; code follows typical setup patterns with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script that loads version info and description from static files, then configures package metadata and CLI entry points. No dynamic execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The regex for version extraction is standard and safe. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are detected. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and very low security risks. The code's structure and content are consistent with a typical, safe package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
