{
  "purpose": "Command-line entry point for the SnapDroid application",
  "sources": "Importing the main function from the snapdroid.snapdroid module",
  "sinks": "Calling the main() function, which could execute potentially untrusted code if the module is malicious",
  "flows": "The script imports and executes main(), which may execute untrusted or malicious code within the snapdroid module",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code structure; reliance on external module's behavior; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The script serves as a simple entry point, importing and executing the main() function from a local package. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns are present. However, since the actual malicious or benign behavior depends on the content of the imported main() function, the script itself appears benign but cannot guarantee safety without examining the imported module. The code itself is minimal and standard for a command-line interface.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward entry point script with no evident malicious behavior or security issues. Its safety depends on the implementation of the imported main() function. Based solely on this code, there are no signs of malicious intent.",
