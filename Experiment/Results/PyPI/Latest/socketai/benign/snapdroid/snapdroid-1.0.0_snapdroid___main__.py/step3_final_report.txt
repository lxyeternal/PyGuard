{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a command-line entry point for the SnapDroid application, importing and executing the main function.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports the main() function from the snapdroid.snapdroid module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: when executed, it calls the imported main() function, which is the primary action.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscation are present. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI launcher that imports and runs main(). It contains no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of the imported main() function, which is not provided. All reports correctly identify this, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2). The confidence in these assessments is high. No issues or malicious behavior are evident within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard for a command-line entry point. The security posture relies on the trustworthiness of the imported main() function. Based solely on this snippet, there is no malicious activity or obfuscation; the risk is minimal and scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
