{
  "purpose": "Command-line entry point for the SnapDroid application, serving as the main script that invokes the main function from the snapdroid module.",
  "sources": "The 'main' function imported from snapdroid.snapdroid module.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of main() when the script is run directly.",
  "flows": "Execution begins at the script, imports 'main', then calls main() if the script is run as the main program.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and follows standard entry point conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the main function from a local module and executes it when run directly. There are no hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. The code structure is typical for a command-line interface entry point.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign entry point script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply delegates execution to the main function of the snapdroid module.",
