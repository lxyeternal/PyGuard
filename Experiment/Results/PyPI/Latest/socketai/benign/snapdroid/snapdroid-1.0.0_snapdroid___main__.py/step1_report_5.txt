{
  "purpose": "Command-line entry point for the SnapDroid application",
  "sources": "The script imports the main function from the snapdroid.snapdroid module",
  "sinks": "Execution of the main() function, which may internally process data or perform actions",
  "flows": "The script calls main() when executed, passing control to the imported module",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple entry point that imports and executes a main function from another module. It contains no embedded or dynamic code, no data handling, no network operations, or system modifications. Its simplicity indicates it is a standard launcher script, assuming the main() function is well-behaved and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and functions as a straightforward entry point without any malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on the imported module for core functionality, which is outside the scope of this snippet.",
