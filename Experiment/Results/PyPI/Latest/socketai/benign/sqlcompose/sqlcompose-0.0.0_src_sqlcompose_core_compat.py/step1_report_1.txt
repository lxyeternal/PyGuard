  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to normalize file paths and compute relative paths.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'file_path' and 'root' in 'fix_path' and 'get_relative_path' functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted data leading to potential vulnerabilities or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through 'fix_path' for path normalization, then potentially used in 'get_relative_path' for relative path calculation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The code performs straightforward path manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for Windows and UNIX path separators. The 'fix_path' function replaces all separators in a given path with the system's standard separator, which is a typical normalization process. The 'get_relative_path' function computes a relative path from a root to a file path, using common prefix logic. Both functions rely on standard library methods and perform no suspicious operations or data exfiltration. No malicious behavior or malware signatures are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be utility functions for path handling with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs simple, standard path normalization and relative path calculations. There are no signs of malware, obfuscated code, or security threats.",
