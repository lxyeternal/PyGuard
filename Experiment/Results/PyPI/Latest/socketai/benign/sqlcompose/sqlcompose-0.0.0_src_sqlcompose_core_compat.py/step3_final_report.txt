  "purpose": "Utility functions for path normalization and relative path calculation using standard library functions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'file_path' and 'root' for path processing.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "Input paths are processed through string replacement and os.path functions without external data flow or execution.",
  "anomalies": "Variable shadowing of 'str' in 'fix_path' function; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward path normalization and relative path computation, relying solely on standard library functions. No suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The variable shadowing of 'str' is a minor style issue but does not impact security. The code handles untrusted input paths but does not execute or process them insecurely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard path handling, and shows no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only minor concern is variable shadowing, which is a style issue, not a security risk.",
