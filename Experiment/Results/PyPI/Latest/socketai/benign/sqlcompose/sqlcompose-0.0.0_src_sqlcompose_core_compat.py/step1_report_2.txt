  "purpose": "Utility functions for normalizing and obtaining relative file paths",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'file_path' and 'root' in functions 'fix_path' and 'get_relative_path'",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points that lead to security issues",
  "flows": "Inputs are processed within functions, primarily for string replacement and path manipulation; no external data flows or network activity",
  "anomalies": "Code performs straightforward string and path operations; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for normalizing file paths and computing relative paths. 'fix_path' replaces all path separators with the system's default separator, which is a standard approach for handling cross-platform file paths. 'get_relative_path' computes relative paths based on common prefixes; it uses 'path.relpath' and 'path.commonprefix', which are standard library functions. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or malicious behavior such as network communication or system manipulation. No suspicious code patterns or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains straightforward path handling utilities with no malicious or security-compromising behavior. It appears safe and benign, intended for normal path normalization tasks.",
