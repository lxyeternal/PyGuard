{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that exports specific functions from the sqlcompose.core.functions package, likely intended for loading SQL-related data or configurations.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement: 'from sqlcompose.core.functions import load, loads'.",
  "sinks": "The code itself does not contain sinks or direct data handling that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows within this code snippet as it only performs import and exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports two functions from a library and exposes them via the __all__ list. No user input handling, data processing, or untrusted data sources are present. The imported functions' security cannot be assessed here, but the module itself contains no malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export statement with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It does not contain any obfuscation or malware indications.",
