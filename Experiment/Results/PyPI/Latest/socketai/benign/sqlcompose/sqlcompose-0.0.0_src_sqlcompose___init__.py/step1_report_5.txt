  "purpose": "This code re-exports functions 'load' and 'loads' from the 'sqlcompose.core.functions' module, likely for simplified import elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing specific functions from an external module",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks",
  "flows": "Code imports functions and re-exports them; no data flow, input, or output processing present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports specific functions from a module and defines __all__ for export. There are no embedded or dynamic code execution, no data leaks, and no suspicious logic. It serves as a simple module re-export, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, acts as a simple re-export of functions from another module, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
