  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\n```python\nfrom sqlcompose.core.functions import load, loads\n\n__all__ = [\n    'load',\n    'loads',\n]\n```\nThis code simply imports two functions from an internal module and exposes them via the `__all__` list, which is standard practice for defining a public API in Python modules.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  The reports uniformly state that the code is straightforward, with no data processing, no external data handling, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. This matches the code, which is minimal and standard.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is a simple re-export and that there are no security risks, malware, or obfuscation present.\n\n- **Scores assigned in reports:**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0  \n  These seem reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n\n### Risk and Malware Scores:\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Since the code is purely import/export with no data handling, no external inputs, and no suspicious behavior, a `securityRisk` score of 0 is appropriate.  \n  The reports' scores are consistent and justified.\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  No malicious activity is suggested or implied. The code does not perform any malicious actions, so a malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is clear and straightforward, so 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Potential Assumptions and Claims:\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities in the imported functions since they only analyze this snippet.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are made, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reasoning is that the code is a simple, standard API re-export without any suspicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No changes needed.",
