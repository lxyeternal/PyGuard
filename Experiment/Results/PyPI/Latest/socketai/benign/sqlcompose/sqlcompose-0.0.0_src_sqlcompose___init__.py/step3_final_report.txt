{
  "purpose": "This code imports two functions, 'load' and 'loads', from an internal module and exposes them as part of the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "The import statement from 'sqlcompose.core.functions' reading the functions 'load' and 'loads'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The source is the imported functions; there are no data flows or external data handling within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import and export declaration with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing functions and defining __all__ for module exports. It contains no data processing, external data handling, or malicious code. All reports correctly identify it as benign with no security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
