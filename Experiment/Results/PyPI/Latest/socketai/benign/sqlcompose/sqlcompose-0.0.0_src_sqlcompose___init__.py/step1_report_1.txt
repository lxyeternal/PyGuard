  "purpose": "Defines the public API for the module by exporting 'load' and 'loads' functions from 'sqlcompose.core.functions'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'load' and 'loads' from 'sqlcompose.core.functions'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external output present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow occurs beyond module import and export statements.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; simple import and export, no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from a specified module and declares them as part of the public API. There are no computations, data processing, or external data sources. No obfuscation, hidden behavior, or malicious code elements are present. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module API declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply exposes two functions from an internal module.",
