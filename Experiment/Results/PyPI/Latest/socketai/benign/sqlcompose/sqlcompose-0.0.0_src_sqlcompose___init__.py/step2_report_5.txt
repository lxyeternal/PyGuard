  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a straightforward Python module that imports two functions, `load` and `loads`, from `sqlcompose.core.functions`.\n   - It then declares these functions as part of the module's public API via the `__all__` list.\n   - There are no data manipulations, no user input handling, no external data sinks, and no dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is minimal, clean, and typical for defining a module interface.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Concerns:**\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious behavior are present.\n   - The import path appears standard and does not suggest any suspicious activity.\n   - The code does not process or handle untrusted data, nor does it perform any actions that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports consistently describe the code as a simple import and export statement.\n   - They emphasize the absence of anomalies, suspicious behavior, or malicious intent.\n   - The confidence scores are all at 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n   - The obfuscated, malware, and securityRisk scores are all 0 across reports, aligning with the code's simplicity.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - Given the code's nature, the assigned scores seem appropriate.\n   - No reason exists to increase malware or risk scores since there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n   - The obfuscated score remains at 0, consistent with the code's straightforwardness.\n   - The security risk score remains at 0, as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions about the imported functions' internal behavior, which are outside the scope of this snippet.\n   - Since the code only re-exports functions, the security implications depend on the imported functions' implementations, which are not part of this review.\n\n6. **Final Justification:**\n   - The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard module re-export with no security concerns.",
