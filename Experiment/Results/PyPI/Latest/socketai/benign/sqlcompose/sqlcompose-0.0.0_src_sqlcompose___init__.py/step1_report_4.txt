{
  "purpose": "This module appears to re-export specific functions ('load', 'loads') from the 'sqlcompose.core.functions' package, likely to be used as part of a larger application dealing with SQL composition or serialization.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'load' and 'loads' from an external module 'sqlcompose.core.functions'. It does not process any input data directly.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists within this snippet, as it only imports and re-exports functions without executing or manipulating data.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a library and defines an export list. There are no operations that handle data, user input, or perform any actions that could lead to security concerns. Since it only sets up re-exports, the potential for malicious behavior or security issues is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to re-export functions from an external library. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
