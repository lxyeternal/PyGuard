  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a straightforward import and export of functions (`load`, `loads`) from `sqlcompose.core.functions`. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities in the code snippet itself. The code is minimal and typical for defining a module API.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that the code only performs import and export operations, with no data processing, input handling, or external interactions that could pose security risks. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- `confidence`: 1 (high confidence)\n- `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n- `malware`: 0 (no malware)\n- `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports agree that there are no malicious behaviors, no data leaks, and no obfuscation, the risk scores are correctly set to zero. The code's purpose is purely to re-export functions, which is common in modular Python packages.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**  \nThe malware score is zero across all reports, which aligns with the code's behavior. There is no evidence of malicious activity, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions About Vulnerabilities**  \nThe reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code does not handle untrusted data, does not perform any operations that could be exploited, and is straightforward.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis: all indicate no issues, no malware, and no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a simple, standard module API declaration with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0. No further action needed.",
