  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom sqlcompose.core.functions import load, loads\n\n__all__ = [\n    'load',\n    'loads',\n]\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues:\n- The code is a straightforward import and export declaration. It does not contain any logic, data processing, or external data handling.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or include any embedded secrets.\n\n**Issue presence:**  \n**No issues are present in the code.** All reports correctly identify this as a benign, standard module setup.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and reasoning review:\n- The reports uniformly state that this is a simple re-export of functions from an internal module, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- The analysis is consistent and accurate: the code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for a Python package interface.\n\n**Errors or flaws:**  \n- No errors are evident in the reasoning. The reports correctly conclude that there are no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's simplicity.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes, given the code's nature, these scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- No higher scores are justified here because there's no evidence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n### Malware considerations:\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume the imported functions are safe, but since the code only re-exports, assessing the functions themselves is outside this snippet's scope.\n- There are no assumptions about vulnerabilities; the code is simply an API surface.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a minimal, standard API declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The uniformity and correctness of the reports are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **The code is benign.**  \n- **All reports correctly identify it as a simple re-export with no security risks.**  \n- **Scores are appropriate and consistent.**  \n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at **0**.  \n- No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to prepare a summarized report or any additional insights?**",
