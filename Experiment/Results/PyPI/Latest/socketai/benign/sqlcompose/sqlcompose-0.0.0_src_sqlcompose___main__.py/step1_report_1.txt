{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to load and print SQL expressions from a file or input string, likely for debugging or further processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the command line argument provided by the user (pargs.input).",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the loaded SQL to the console via print(sql).",
  "flows": "Input argument -> load or loads function (depending on file existence) -> print SQL output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The use of external functions load and loads from sqlcompose.core.functions suggests potential for SQL handling but not malicious intent. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code accepts an input string from the user, determines if it is a filename or raw SQL string, loads the SQL accordingly, and prints it. It relies on external functions load and loads, which are not provided, so their behavior is unknown. The script does not perform network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. Exception handling is standard, with no malicious indicators. The core logic appears benign, focusing solely on loading and printing SQL data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for loading and displaying SQL expressions. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities within this fragment. It depends on external functions for SQL loading, which should be reviewed separately, but based on this code alone, it poses no security risks.",
