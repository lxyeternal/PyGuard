{
  "purpose": "The script processes an SQL expression or file, loads its content using functions from the 'sqlcompose' library, and prints the result.",
  "sources": "Input source is the 'input' argument provided via command line, which can be a file path or a direct SQL expression string.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the 'print(sql)' statement, which outputs the loaded SQL content.",
  "flows": "Input argument -> load or loads function -> print statement",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. Usage of third-party 'sqlcompose' library is standard; no indication of malicious intent. No data leakage or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward command-line tool that accepts an input (file path or SQL string), loads its content via imported functions, and prints it. Exception handling is standard. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors. The functions from 'sqlcompose' are used solely for loading SQL data, with no direct evidence of malicious manipulation. The flow is simple, with no user data beyond the input argument and no network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and functional as a utility for loading and displaying SQL content. No malicious or suspicious activity detected. It relies on external libraries for core functionality, but nothing suspicious is evident in its structure or logic.",
