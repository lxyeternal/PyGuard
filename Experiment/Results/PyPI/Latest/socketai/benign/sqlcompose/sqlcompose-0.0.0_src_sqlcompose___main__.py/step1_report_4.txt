{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface to load and display SQL expressions from a file or direct input.",
  "sources": "Input data from command-line arguments (pargs.input), which can be a file path or a string of SQL code.",
  "sinks": "The 'load' and 'loads' functions from sqlcompose.core.functions, which may process or execute SQL expressions; also the print statement outputs the SQL code.",
  "flows": "User input (pargs.input) → load or loads functions → output via print",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The use of load and loads depends on external library; their behavior is unknown but assumed to parse or load SQL expressions, not malicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code accepts user input as either a filename or direct SQL string, then loads it using external functions and prints the result. There are no network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration evident. Exception handling is straightforward, only printing errors. Since 'load' and 'loads' are imported from an external library, their internal behavior is unknown; however, based on naming, they likely parse or process SQL expressions. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs are present. The code does not perform unsafe evaluation or execute arbitrary code. Overall, it functions as a simple loader and display tool for SQL expressions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility for loading and printing SQL expressions from a file or string. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The functions used are external but assumed to be safe and relevant for parsing SQL, not executing malicious code.",
