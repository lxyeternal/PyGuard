  "purpose": "Parse an input string or file containing SQL expressions and load it using functions from sqlcompose.core.functions",
  "sources": "ArgumentParser reads command-line input; load and loads functions read SQL content from file or string",
  "sinks": "print(sql) outputs the loaded SQL; exception handling outputs error messages",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> load/load functions -> print output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; use of external functions (load, loads) could be scrutinized if malicious but are typical; no evident malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The script initializes an argument parser to accept an input parameter, checks if it is a file, then loads SQL content via external functions 'load' or 'loads'. It then prints the SQL content. The exception handling is standard, printing errors and exiting. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity is present. The use of external functions 'load' and 'loads' cannot be verified here, but assuming they are legitimate, standard, and safe, there is no malicious intent. No suspicious anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The overall code is straightforward and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple command-line utility for loading and printing SQL expressions from a file or string. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident in this snippet. The external functions could be a concern if malicious, but based solely on this code, it appears safe.",
