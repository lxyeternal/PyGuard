  "purpose": "A command-line utility to load and print SQL expressions or files.",
  "sources": "Input argument (file path or SQL string), external functions 'load' and 'loads' from 'sqlcompose.core.functions'.",
  "sinks": "None directly; potential risk depends on external functions' behavior, which is unknown.",
  "flows": "Input argument -> check if file -> load via 'load' or 'loads' -> print SQL.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code. External functions' behavior is unknown but presumed safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI tool that loads SQL data from a file or string and prints it. It relies on external functions whose internal behavior is not provided; if these functions are malicious, they could pose a risk, but the code itself shows no malicious or suspicious activity. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, assuming external functions are safe. The primary concern is external dependency safety, but within this fragment, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects reliance on external functions whose safety should be verified separately. Overall, the code is safe for use, with minimal security concerns.",
