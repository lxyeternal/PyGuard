  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the script is a simple CLI utility that loads SQL expressions or files and prints the content.\n- They highlight that the code relies on external functions `load` and `loads` from `sqlcompose.core.functions`, whose behavior is unknown but presumed to parse or load SQL data.\n- No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are detected.\n- The primary concern is the external functions, but within this code fragment, no malicious activity is evident.\n- All reports assign a high confidence level (0.8-0.9) that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code itself does **not** contain malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated segments.\n- It is a straightforward utility for loading and printing SQL data.\n- The external functions `load` and `loads` are unknown; their safety depends on their implementation, but there's no indication they are malicious.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports correctly identify the reliance on external functions but do not critique that this is a potential risk if those functions are malicious or compromised.\n- They do not explicitly mention that the behavior of `load` and `loads` could be critical; if these functions execute or evaluate SQL in a unsafe manner, that could introduce vulnerabilities, but the current code does not show such behavior.\n- The reasoning is consistent; no overstatement or unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code does not exhibit malicious behavior directly.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, which is reasonable; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2; given the reliance on external functions, this is acceptable but could be slightly higher if those functions are unsafe.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The main concern is the external functions. If `load` and `loads` are safe and well-implemented, the overall risk remains low.\n- If these functions are malicious or untrusted, the risk could be higher, but this cannot be determined from this code alone.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (to reflect reliance on external functions and potential unknown behavior)\n\n**Note:** The scores should remain low unless additional context about the external functions indicates malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Remarks:\n- The code appears benign and intended for debugging or processing SQL expressions.\n- The external functions' safety is the only concern, but within this code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The overall security posture is low risk, with a slight concern over external dependencies.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis comprehensive review supports the conclusion that the code itself is safe, but the external functions should be audited for security if their implementation is unknown or untrusted.",
