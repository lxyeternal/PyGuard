{
  "purpose": "Parse input SQL expression or file path and load the SQL content",
  "sources": "User input provided via command line argument",
  "sinks": "The 'load' and 'loads' functions could process untrusted data; 'print(sql)' outputs data, but not to a network or system modification",
  "flows": "Input argument -> load/loads functions -> printed output",
  "anomalies": "Use of external functions 'load' and 'loads' without context; no direct dangerous code but reliance on external library behavior; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The script uses argparse to accept an input string which is either a file path or SQL expression. It then calls 'load' or 'loads' from an imported library to process this input. The functions 'load' and 'loads' are from 'sqlcompose.core.functions', which are external and their behavior is unknown here. The code does not contain any code injection, data leakage, or system modification. It simply reads and prints the processed SQL content. No suspicious or malicious actions are apparent within this module itself. Since 'load' and 'loads' are external, their implementation determines overall safety, but within this code, no malicious intent or malicious code inclusion is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward CLI tool to load and display SQL expressions or files. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware in this fragment. It relies on external functions whose safety cannot be verified here, but based on this code alone, there is no malicious activity.",
