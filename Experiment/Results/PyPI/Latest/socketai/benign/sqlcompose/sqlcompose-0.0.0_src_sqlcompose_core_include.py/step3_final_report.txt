  "purpose": "A simple data container class for storing SQL query, name, match pattern, and source information.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters (__sql, __name, __match, __source) assigned to private attributes",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the class only stores data without processing or executing it",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters to private attributes, then accessed via read-only properties",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no suspicious or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The class defines four private attributes with memory optimization via __slots__, providing read-only accessors. It does not perform any code execution, network activity, or data manipulation. The __sql attribute could be used elsewhere for database operations, but within this snippet, it remains inert. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, straightforward data container with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities within this snippet. The potential security concern depends on external usage of the stored SQL string, outside the scope of this class.",
