  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple data container class with no dynamic execution, external resource access, or suspicious behavior.\n- The only attribute that could be potentially concerning is `__sql`, which might be used elsewhere for database operations, but within this code snippet, it is merely stored and retrieved.\n- The scores assigned to malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, which aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern based on this snippet alone.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code; it is a basic class with private attributes and property getters.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None are evident; the code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Scores for malware/obfuscation:** Zero for malware and obfuscated, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** The low risk scores (0.2) seem reasonable, considering the potential for misuse depends on external handling of the `sql` string, which is outside this code's scope.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- The only point of caution is that the `sql` attribute could be used maliciously elsewhere if, for example, the stored SQL string is executed unsafely (e.g., via string concatenation leading to SQL injection). However, within this code snippet, there is no evidence of such behavior.\n- The reports do not claim or imply obfuscation or malicious intent; they consistently rate the code as benign.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed unless future context reveals unsafe handling of the `sql` attribute elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (appropriate, considering potential misuse in larger context but no direct evidence here)\n\n**In conclusion,** based on this code snippet and reports, I agree with the current scoring. The code itself is benign, and the potential security concern hinges on how the `sql` attribute is used elsewhere, which is outside this snippet.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nPlease let me know if further context or code snippets are available for review.",
