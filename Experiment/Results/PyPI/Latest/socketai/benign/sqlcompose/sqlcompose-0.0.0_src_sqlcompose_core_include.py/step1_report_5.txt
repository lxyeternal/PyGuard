{
  "purpose": "Defines a class 'Include' that encapsulates four string attributes: sql, name, match, and source.",
  "sources": "Constructor (__init__) method where input parameters sql, name, match, source are assigned to private variables.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data handling or output functions are implemented within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters to private attributes, then to property getters. No external data flow or processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The class appears to be a simple data container.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward class with private attributes and property accessors, serving as a data container. There are no operations that execute code dynamically, perform network communication, or access external resources. It does not include any malicious or suspicious behavior. The absence of data processing, validation, or external interactions indicates a standard implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign class definition used for data encapsulation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard, safe data structure.",
