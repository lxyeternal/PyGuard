{
  "purpose": "This class appears to be a data container for storing SQL query and related metadata.",
  "sources": "Data is set via the constructor parameters (__sql, __name, __match, __source). No external input reading is directly shown.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data outputs are present in this code segment.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this code; it only initializes and provides property accessors.",
  "anomalies": "The class stores a __sql attribute but does not process or execute it, reducing immediate risk. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are evident. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or complex logic.",
  "analysis": "The class defines a simple data structure with private attributes and property accessors. It does not perform any operations on the stored data beyond encapsulation. There are no dynamic code evaluations, external data reads, or suspicious actions observed. The SQL string is stored but not executed within this code, which limits risk. Without additional context, the class itself does not show malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple data container class with no malicious behavior. It does not contain code execution, data leakage, or suspicious logic. It is likely part of a larger system, but in isolation, it presents no security concerns.",
