{
  "purpose": "The class appears to be a simple data container for storing SQL query and related metadata.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters (__sql, __name, __match, __source) are sources where data is provided to the class.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in this code snippet; it does not execute or process the data beyond storage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor inputs to private attributes (__sql, __name, __match, __source) and then can be retrieved via property methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and only defines a data container without executing or transforming data in suspicious ways.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with __slots__ to restrict attribute creation and reduce memory usage. It initializes four private attributes via constructor arguments and provides property accessors. There are no operations, data processing, or external interactions such as network calls, file access, or command execution. The code does not include dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or handling of untrusted input beyond data storage. It appears purely structural and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The class is a simple data container with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any actions beyond storing provided data. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are apparent.",
