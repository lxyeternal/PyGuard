  "purpose": "A class that encapsulates SQL query and related metadata, possibly used for database operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in the constructor (__init__), specifically sql, name, match, and source.",
  "sinks": "The 'sql' property, which can be used to execute SQL commands in a database context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters to object properties; the 'sql' property can be accessed for execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and does not perform any I/O or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The class defines a simple data container with four attributes: __sql, __name, __match, and __source. It uses __slots__ for memory optimization. All data is set via the constructor and accessible through properties. No dynamic execution, no external data fetching, and no apparent malicious intent. The 'sql' attribute could be used in a context where SQL injection is possible if improperly handled elsewhere, but this code by itself does not execute or manipulate the SQL string beyond storing it.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data container class with no malicious behavior or suspicious features. It does not contain any logic that could be inherently malicious or maliciously obfuscated. The potential security concern depends on how the stored 'sql' string is used elsewhere, but that is outside the scope of this code.",
