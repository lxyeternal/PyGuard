  "purpose": "Class to encapsulate SQL statement and associated metadata such as name, match pattern, and source.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters (__sql, __name, __match, __source) are assigned directly from input arguments.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data processing observed in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor inputs to private attributes (__sql, __name, __match, __source) without modification.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and simple.",
  "analysis": "The class is a simple data container with read-only properties. It stores provided parameters without performing any processing or executing code. No dynamic code execution, external resource access, or suspicious patterns are present. The presence of a __sql attribute could suggest usage in database operations elsewhere, but in this snippet, it is only stored and retrieved.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a basic data container with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or malicious actions. No security risks identified within this limited scope.",
