{
  "purpose": "This code processes SQL scripts with include directives, composing them into a single query, while handling file paths and preventing circular includes.",
  "sources": "Reading files via open(), reading SQL strings, pattern matching with REGEX_INCLUDE, user-supplied filenames.",
  "sinks": "File reading operations, string manipulation (sub), dynamic SQL composition, recursive function calls.",
  "flows": "Input filenames -> file reading -> regex matching include directives -> recursive compose calls -> string substitution of include matches -> final SQL output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of recursive file inclusion is well-controlled with checks for circular dependencies. No evidence of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration. The code only reads and processes files to generate SQL, with no suspicious side effects.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads SQL files, resolves include directives through regex pattern matching, and recursively composes SQL scripts. It uses path fixing and includes mechanisms to prevent circular dependencies. No external network activity, no malicious code execution, and no data leakage mechanisms are evident. The code does not contain any obfuscation or hidden logic; it follows a clear structure. The only potential concern might be the handling of file paths and the possibility of malicious files being included if provided externally, but the code itself does not attempt any harmful actions beyond file reading and string substitution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a safe SQL preprocessor designed for including external SQL snippets, with proper checks against circular includes. There are no signs of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It performs standard file processing and string manipulations without any suspicious side effects.",
