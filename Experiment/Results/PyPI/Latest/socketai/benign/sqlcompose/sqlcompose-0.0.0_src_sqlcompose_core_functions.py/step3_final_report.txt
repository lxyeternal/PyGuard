  "purpose": "This code processes SQL files with support for nested includes, preventing cycles and duplicate inclusions, to compose a final SQL script.",
  "sources": "File reads from specified filenames, regex matching for include directives.",
  "sinks": "String substitution in SQL content, file reading operations.",
  "flows": "File read -> regex match -> recursive compose calls -> string substitution -> final SQL output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward include processing with cycle detection.",
  "analysis": "The code reads SQL files, detects include directives via regex, recursively includes referenced files while preventing include cycles, and replaces include placeholders with file contents. It handles nested includes safely, with proper cycle detection and duplicate inclusion avoidance. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The logic is clear, with standard file operations and regex substitutions. The risk primarily involves inclusion of malicious files, but the code itself does not perform any malicious actions. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured SQL composition utility supporting nested includes with safeguards against cycles. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external file trustworthiness, but the code itself is safe.",
