{
  "purpose": "The code processes SQL files with include directives, composing final SQL queries by inlining included files and wrapping them in CTEs.",
  "sources": "File system reads for included SQL files, reading main SQL file, reading files referenced in include directives.",
  "sinks": "Reading external files; no direct output or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Input SQL with include directives -> file read operations for included files -> composed SQL with inlined includes -> returned SQL string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of recursion for file inclusion; no evident hardcoded secrets or credentials; no network operations; use of regular expressions for include directives. No obfuscated code or misleading variables detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs file inclusion for SQL composition, utilizing recursive calls to embed included SQL files into the main query. It maintains include tracking to prevent circular dependencies and duplicate includes. File reads are constrained to local filesystem paths, with no network or external data transmissions. The function compose handles include directives via regex, safely reads files, and constructs SQL with optional CTE wrapping. No suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors detected. The code seems to serve a legitimate purpose of SQL file composition, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. The only potential concern is if included files are untrusted or manipulated, but such behavior isn't inherently malicious within this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a SQL file composer that reads and processes include directives recursively. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided code. No security threats or malicious intent are evident; the code appears safe and functional for its purpose.",
