{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to process, separate, and prepare PDB files for molecular modeling, including fixing missing residues, adding hydrogens, and saving components.",
  "sources": "Reads input PDB file specified by 'input_pdb'; reads 'residuetypes.dat' resource file for residue classification; reads and processes molecular data via PDBFixer and OpenMM libraries.",
  "sinks": "Writes output PDB files for separated components and fixed chains; no untrusted data is written to network, database, or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input file validation and loading -> residue classification from resource file -> chain processing and separation -> saving components -> fixing chains -> output file generation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'importlib.resources.open_text' to access 'residuetypes.dat' from a package resource; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present; all file operations are local and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file I/O, resource management, and data processing for molecular structures. It verifies input files, reads a data resource for residue types, and writes output PDB files. It utilizes 'PDBFixer' for fixing molecular structures. There is no evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, credential theft, or data exfiltration. The use of package resources appears appropriate, and no suspicious behavior or malicious backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate molecular data processing tool with no malicious intent. It properly handles files and resources, performs standard operations for molecular structure preparation, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
