{
  "purpose": "The code processes PDB files to separate components, fix residues, add missing atoms/hydrogens, and save the processed structures, facilitating structure preparation for molecular simulations.",
  "sources": "Input PDB file specified by the user; internal resource 'residuetypes.dat' loaded via importlib.resources.",
  "sinks": "Output files containing fixed and separated components, saved in the specified output directory.",
  "flows": "Reads input PDB file and resource data; classifies residues; processes chains; writes fixed structures and separated components to output files.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; resource file loaded locally; no network activity or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file validation, resource loading, and structure processing using well-known libraries. It classifies residues based on internal resource data, separates components, and writes output files. No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration are present. The resource file is loaded from internal package resources, ensuring controlled access. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical molecular biology workflows. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are found. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured molecular structure processing utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal risk score reflects the controlled, local file operations and resource handling. Overall, the supply chain security risk is negligible.",
