  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured molecular structure processing utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal risk score reflects the controlled, local file operations and resource handling. Overall, the supply chain security risk is negligible."
