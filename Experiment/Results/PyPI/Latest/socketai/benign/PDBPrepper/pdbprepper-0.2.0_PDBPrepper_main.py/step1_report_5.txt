{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to process, analyze, and modify PDB files for molecular simulations, including separation of components, fixing residues, and adding missing atoms or hydrogens.",
  "sources": "File input (input_pdb), reading residue types from a resource file ('residuetypes.dat'), and reading/writing PDB files for selections and output.",
  "sinks": "Writing output PDB files for fixed chains, separate components, and selections; printing to console.",
  "flows": "Input PDB file is read via PDBFixer; residue type data is read from a resource; separate_components() analyzes chain residues; save_selection() writes PDB files; fix_protein_chain() modifies structures; run() orchestrates the workflow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are evident. Usage of resource files and standard I/O operations are typical. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to perform standard file handling, data parsing, and structure modifications related to molecular PDB files. It loads residue type data from a resource file, processes chains for component separation, and modifies structures via PDBFixer without any evident malicious logic. No network activity, code injection, or suspicious data flows are detected. The structure and purpose align with typical scientific preprocessing scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate molecular preprocessing tool with no indications of malicious intent or supply chain sabotage. It functions as expected for scientific data handling, with no malicious behaviors detected.",
