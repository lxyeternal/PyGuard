  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be a generic Python script that could be part of a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard input, environment variables, and possibly external modules or network connections.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file operations, or subprocess calls that could execute untrusted data or exfiltrate information.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network functions, file handlers, or execution commands.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. The code uses standard libraries without suspicious patterns. No hidden code or unusual language features identified.",
  "analysis": "The review examined the entire code for signs of malicious intent, including hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or backdoor behavior. The code uses common Python constructs and standard modules. No evidence of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior was found. The code structure and format appear normal, with no obfuscated or misleading patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and aligns with typical application logic. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
