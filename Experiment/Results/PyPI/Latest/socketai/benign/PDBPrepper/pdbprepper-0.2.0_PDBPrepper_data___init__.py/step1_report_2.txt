  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions. No explicit purpose is indicated by the code comments or structure, but it does not show signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters and possibly environment variables or external files if present, but no specific data sources are evident in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network connections, system calls, or file writes to sensitive locations are visible or suspicious in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input functions or variables to processing logic, but without evidence of untrusted data paths leading to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution are detected. The code structure appears straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code was carefully reviewed, including initial, middle, and final segments. No suspicious patterns, malicious payloads, or security risks are evident. Usage of third-party libraries, if any, seems standard. There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code's behavior appears benign and consistent with typical utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in the provided code. The code appears benign and safe for use.",
