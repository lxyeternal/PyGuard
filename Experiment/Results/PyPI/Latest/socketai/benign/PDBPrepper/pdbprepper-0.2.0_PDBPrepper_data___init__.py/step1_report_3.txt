  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script intended to demonstrate or perform basic file operations and possibly some environment checks.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, reading from the filesystem",
  "sinks": "Writing to files, printing to console",
  "flows": "Environment variables or file data -> processing -> output to file or console",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables and file contents, then prints or writes outputs. There are no signs of malicious actions such as data exfiltration, network connections, or system modifications. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward logic suggests benign intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated sections are present. The code's structure and operations are typical for legitimate scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be benign and intended for routine file or environment handling tasks.",
