  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; import statement itself does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed; just an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import (*), which can hide imported names and potentially import malicious or unintended code if the module is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a wildcard import from a sibling module named 'main'. This practice can obscure the actual functions or variables imported, making static analysis more difficult. It does not execute any malicious code directly but could be problematic if the imported module contains malicious payloads or is compromised. The code is minimal and standard in structure, with no obfuscated language features or unusual syntax. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple import, which by itself is not malicious but is a questionable practice due to the wildcard import. The presence of only this line suggests a low likelihood of malicious intent, but the actual risk depends on the contents of the 'main' module. No evidence of malware or security issues is apparent from this fragment alone.",
