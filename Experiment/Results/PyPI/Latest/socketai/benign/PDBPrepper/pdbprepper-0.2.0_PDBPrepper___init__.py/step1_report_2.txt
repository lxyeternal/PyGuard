  "purpose": "Import all contents from the main module within the same package",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which loads code from .main",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data handling occurs in this line",
  "flows": "Potentially, any imported code from main could contain flows, but not visible here",
  "anomalies": "The import is very minimal and standard; no anomalies detected in this line alone",
  "analysis": "The code simply performs a relative import from a module named main within the same package. This is a common Python pattern for modular code. Since no additional code is provided, there's no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The security implications depend entirely on the contents of the imported module, which are not provided. Therefore, based on this snippet alone, no malicious or suspicious activity can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard import statement without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. Further analysis would require inspecting the contents of the 'main' module.",
