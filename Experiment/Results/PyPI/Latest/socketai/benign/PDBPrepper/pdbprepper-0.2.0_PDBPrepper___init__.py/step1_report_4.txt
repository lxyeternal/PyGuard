  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local 'main' module",
  "sources": "The 'from .main import *' statement reads the content of the 'main' module in the same package",
  "sinks": "Potentially any part of the imported module if it contains untrusted code, but the statement itself does not execute or process untrusted data directly",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow in this single import statement; the behavior depends on the contents of 'main'",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure which functions or data are brought into scope, but it is not inherently malicious or suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of an import statement that imports everything from the 'main' module in the current package. No additional code, data processing, or network interactions are present. Without inspecting the 'main' module, it's impossible to determine if imported content contains malicious code. The statement itself is standard Python syntax for importing modules, and no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple import statement. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet alone. The security concern depends entirely on the content of the 'main' module, which cannot be assessed here.",
