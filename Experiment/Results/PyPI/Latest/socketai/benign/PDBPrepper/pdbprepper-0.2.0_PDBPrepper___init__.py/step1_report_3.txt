{
  "purpose": "The code imports everything from the local module 'main', which likely contains core functionality for the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module 'main'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; import statement by itself does not execute untrusted data or code",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows; the import could execute code in 'main' if it contains executable statements",
  "anomalies": "The use of a wildcard import ('*') can obscure the actual imported content, potentially hiding malicious code or side effects within 'main'. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a bare import from a local module, which by itself is benign but can hide malicious or unintended code if 'main' contains malicious code. The import statement may trigger execution of code in 'main'. Without inspecting 'main', the security implications are limited to potential hidden malicious code within that module. The code structure is minimal and does not reveal any suspicious patterns directly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, performing a local import that could execute code from 'main'. There are no explicit signs of malicious behavior, but the use of wildcard import can hide malicious code if present in 'main'. Further review of 'main' is recommended to assess the overall security.",
