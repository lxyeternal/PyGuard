{
  "purpose": "The code performs a relative import of all symbols from the 'main' module within the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; potential reliance on the contents of the 'main' module.",
  "sinks": "Imported symbols from 'main' could be used in subsequent code; if malicious, could lead to code execution or data leakage depending on usage.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads all symbols from 'main'; subsequent code (not provided) could invoke or utilize these symbols, potentially executing malicious code if present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which obscures imported symbols, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code; no direct malicious activity in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal relative import statement that loads all symbols from 'main'. This practice can hide malicious code if 'main' is compromised, but the snippet itself contains no malicious logic or obfuscation. The malware score remains 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The security risk score is low (around 0.2), reflecting the potential risk due to the import style, but actual threat depends on the contents of 'main'. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.7), given the simplicity of the code and the reliance on external module content. Obfuscation is not present, so obfuscated score remains 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign but employs a practice ('import *') that can conceal malicious code if 'main' is compromised. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are appropriate. Further security assurance requires inspecting the 'main' module's contents.",
