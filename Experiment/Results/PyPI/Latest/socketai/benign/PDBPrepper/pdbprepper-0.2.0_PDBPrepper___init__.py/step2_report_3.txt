  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports focus on the same code: `from .main import *`\n- The code is minimal, performing a wildcard import from a local module.\n- No direct malicious activity, data flow, or code execution is evident in this fragment.\n- The main concern revolves around the use of `import *`, which can hide malicious code within the imported module (`main`).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues in the code:\n\n- **Issue presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code performs a wildcard import, which is discouraged because it can hide imported names and potentially mask malicious code if the imported module is compromised.\n- **Malicious code detection:** The code snippet itself does not contain malicious code or behavior; any malicious activity would depend on the contents of the `main` module, which is not provided.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n\n- **Logical consistency:** All reports are consistent in stating that the import statement itself is benign but potentially risky depending on the contents of `main`.\n- **Overgeneralization:** Some reports suggest that the import could \"execute code\" or \"hide malicious code.\" While technically importing executes module-level code (if any), this is standard behavior, and without inspecting `main`, no malicious activity can be confirmed.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the analysis, as no malicious activity is directly observed.\n\n### Evaluation of scores:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which seems appropriate given the information.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are zero, which is reasonable; no obfuscation techniques are evident.\n- **Risk scores:** Range from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low concern, which is appropriate considering the minimal code and lack of evidence of malicious intent.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes, they seem proportionate to the analysis. The only concern is the wildcard import, which is a best practice violation but not inherently malicious.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- The highest risk score is 0.2, reflecting low but non-zero concern due to the wildcard import.\n\n### Consistency with the report content:\n\n- The scores align well with the reasoning: minimal code, no evidence of malware, and potential concern due to import practices.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations and final assessment:\n\n- **Overall malware score:** 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation techniques.\n- **Risk score:** Given the reliance on the imported module, a slightly higher risk score (e.g., 0.2) is justified, which is already reflected in the reports.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of the `main` module, which cannot be assessed here.\n- The use of `import *` should be discouraged in secure codebases, but it does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n## Final conclusion:\n\n- The code itself is benign but uses a practice (`import *`) that can hide malicious code if the imported module is compromised.\n- The current scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n- Further security assessment should include inspecting the contents of the `main` module.\n\n---\n\n**Summary estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (to reflect the potential danger of hidden malicious code within `main`)\n\nThis approach balances the minimal risk of the code snippet itself with the potential risk posed by the imported module.",
