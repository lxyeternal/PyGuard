  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the code snippet.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom .main import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The code is a straightforward import statement. It does **not** execute any code directly, nor does it process untrusted data.\n- The use of `import *` (wildcard import) is generally discouraged because it obscures which symbols are imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code if the imported module is compromised.\n- The actual security risk hinges entirely on the contents of the `.main` module, which we cannot see here.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose:** Import all components from `.main`.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of wildcard import.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that `import *` can hide malicious code if `.main` is compromised.\n- **Conclusion:** Low likelihood of malicious intent from this line alone; depends on `.main`.\n- **Confidence:** 0.7\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malware)\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (moderate concern due to import style)\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No direct malware, but the wildcard import warrants caution. The malware score should remain 0.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose:** Import all from `.main`.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies detected.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that the import is standard, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks apparent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.5\n- **Malware score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose:** Import everything from local `.main`.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard import can hide malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes that the import could execute malicious code if `.main` contains it.\n- **Conclusion:** Further review of `.main` is recommended.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n- **Malware score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No direct malware, but the import pattern warrants caution.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose:** Import all from `.main`.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard import can obscure imported symbols.\n- **Analysis:** Similar reasoning; no signs of malicious activity in the snippet.\n- **Conclusion:** Further inspection of `.main` needed.\n- **Confidence:** 0.5\n- **Malware score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. No direct malware.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose:** Import all from `.main`.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard import can hide malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that the import itself is not malicious but could conceal malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Further review of `.main` recommended.\n- **Confidence:** 0.4\n- **Malware score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the fact that the code alone does not execute any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is appropriate; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting a low but non-zero concern due to import style.\n\n### Justification of risk scores:\n- The main concern is the use of `import *`, which can hide malicious code if `.main` is compromised.\n- Since the content of `.main` is unknown, the risk scores should remain low but acknowledge the potential hazard.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code itself is benign but uses a pattern (`import *`) that can hide malicious payloads.\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 unless evidence suggests `.main` contains malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** Should be around 0.2, reflecting the potential risk due to import style.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall recommendations:**\n- The current scores are reasonable.\n- The primary concern is the trustworthiness of `.main`.\n- If further analysis of `.main` reveals malicious code, the malware score should be increased accordingly.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**  | **0**        | **0.2** |\n\nThe current scores are appropriate given the code snippet and the reports' reasoning.",
