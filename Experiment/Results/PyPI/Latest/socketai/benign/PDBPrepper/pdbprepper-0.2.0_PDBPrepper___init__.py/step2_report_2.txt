  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code snippet is: `from .main import *`\n- All reports correctly identify this as a relative wildcard import from a module named `main` in the same package.\n- No additional code or suspicious logic is present.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate each report's analysis and conclusions**\n\n- All reports agree that the import statement itself is benign in isolation but can be problematic due to the use of `import *`, which obscures imported symbols.\n- None of the reports find evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity in this snippet alone.\n- They correctly note that the security implications depend on the contents of the `main` module, which is not provided.\n\n**Step 3: Check the scoring**\n\n- Malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of direct malicious code in this fragment.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the potential risk of hidden malicious code within `main` due to the wildcard import.\n\n**Step 4: Critical review of scores and reasoning**\n\n- The scores seem reasonable given the evidence.\n- The confidence levels vary from 0.4 to 0.7, which is appropriate considering the limited context.\n- The reports emphasize the importance of reviewing `main` for malicious content, which is prudent.\n\n**Step 5: Recommendations and justification**\n\n- Since the code is just an import statement, and no malicious activity is evident, the overall malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The security risk score could be slightly increased if we consider the risk of malicious code hiding within `main`, but given the current evidence, keeping it low is justified.\n- The use of `import *` is a questionable practice but not malicious per se.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.2** (consistent with the reports, but could be marginally increased if desired)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a simple relative wildcard import. There is no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The main concern is the potential risk if `main` contains malicious code, but without inspecting it, this remains speculative. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** For comprehensive security assurance, an audit of the `main` module is recommended, especially considering the use of `import *`, which can hide malicious functions or variables.",
