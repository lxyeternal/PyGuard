  "purpose": "The code processes Esri Vector Tile Packages (.vtpk), reading tile index data, decompressing tile features, and transforming spatial geometries into coordinate systems using standard GIS libraries.",
  "sources": "ZIP archive entries ('p12/tilemap/root.json', 'p12/root.json'), gzip streams, tile feature data, JSON metadata",
  "sinks": "Decoded vector tile features, transformed geometries returned for further use",
  "flows": "ZIP archive reading -> decompress gzip -> decode vector tiles -> coordinate transformation -> output features",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; standard data processing flow",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard GIS vector tile handler that reads from zip archives, decompresses tile data, decodes vector tiles, and applies coordinate transformations. It uses well-known libraries (zipfile, gzip, json, mapbox_vector_tile, shapely, pyproj) without obfuscation or malicious constructs. No network activity or backdoors are present. The code handles untrusted data but does so securely, with appropriate validation (e.g., LOD ranges, axis directions). The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and the typical risks in GIS data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured GIS vector tile processing library with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws. The minimal security risk reflects the handling of untrusted spatial data, which is inherent to GIS applications but does not indicate malicious intent.",
