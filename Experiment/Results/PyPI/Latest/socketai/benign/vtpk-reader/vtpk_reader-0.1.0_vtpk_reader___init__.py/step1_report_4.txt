  "purpose": "Import classes Vtpk and VtpkError from the vtpk_reader.vtpk_reader module.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from an external module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flows; no input or data processing is shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and only includes imports with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports two classes from the 'vtpk_reader' package, which appears to be a standard import statement. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows within this snippet. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. Since the code is limited to import statements, it does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with no indications of malicious intent or security concerns. It merely imports classes, which is typical in Python modules.",
