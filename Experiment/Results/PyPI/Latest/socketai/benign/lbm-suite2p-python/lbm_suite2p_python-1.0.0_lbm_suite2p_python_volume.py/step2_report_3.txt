  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, data flows, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is characterized as standard data processing and visualization utilities for neuroscience datasets. No suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — aligns with the conclusion.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — reasonable, given no evident vulnerabilities.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound. The code relies on standard libraries, file I/O, and subprocess calls for ffmpeg, all typical for scientific workflows. No hidden malicious intent is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with a focus on data loading, plotting, and media conversion. No suspicious code patterns or malicious behavior are identified.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — still low, considering standard usage.\n- **Comments:** The analysis correctly notes the standard use of external tools and no obfuscation or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the review emphasizes that the code performs typical data visualization and processing tasks. The subprocess calls for ffmpeg are standard and do not seem malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — acceptable.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning aligns with the code's apparent purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer notes potential risks with subprocess calls, especially if file paths are manipulated. However, within controlled environments, the code appears safe.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher due to subprocess execution, but still low.\n- **Comments:** The caution about subprocess security is valid, but no evidence of malicious activity is found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The review concludes that the code is benign, performing standard data handling and visualization tasks with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — justified.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — aligns with the overall low risk.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is consistent and thorough.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code content:** All reports agree that the code is a set of utility functions for scientific data processing, visualization, and media creation.\n- **Malware potential:** No suspicious code, obfuscated patterns, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- **Security risks:** Low, primarily related to subprocess calls, but these are standard and controlled.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — minimal, considering subprocess calls and file handling, but overall safe.\n\n**Note:** The subprocess calls to ffmpeg are standard for media encoding. If input paths are controlled and validated, the risk remains low. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion,** the code appears to be legitimate scientific utility functions with no malicious intent or security concerns based on static analysis.",
