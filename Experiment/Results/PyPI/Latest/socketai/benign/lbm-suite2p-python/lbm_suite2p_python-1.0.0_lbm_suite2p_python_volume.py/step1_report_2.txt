{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for loading, processing, visualizing, and saving neural imaging data, mainly for analyzing calcium imaging and neuron segmentation results in neuroscience experiments.",
  "sources": "Reads data from files such as .npy, .png, .jpg, .tif, and .npz files; user-provided file paths; and data loaded via external libraries (e.g., load_ops).",
  "sinks": "Saves figures as images, saves numpy arrays as .npy files, and generates video files in formats .mp4, .avi, and .mov; also writes processed data back to disk.",
  "flows": "Loads data from files (sources) and processes them through various functions, then visualizes or saves the data to output files (sinks), such as images, videos, or numpy arrays.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures observed. Usage of external subprocess calls for ffmpeg is standard for video processing. No obfuscated or malware-like code behaviors detected. No unusual code patterns or hidden functionalities found.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly performs data loading, plotting, and file writing tasks with clear, conventional usage patterns. It uses well-known libraries like numpy, matplotlib, cv2, and subprocess for video encoding. The subprocess calls for ffmpeg are standard for media conversion. No suspicious data exfiltration, hidden commands, or malicious data handling mechanisms are present. File paths are handled dynamically, and no hardcoded secrets or credentials are observed. All external command executions are standard media encoding commands. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate utility functions for data analysis and visualization in neuroscience workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate set of data processing and visualization utilities intended for neuroscience image analysis. No malware, backdoors, or security risks are detected based on static code review.",
