{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for loading, processing, visualizing, and converting neuroscience imaging data, including plotting raster maps, volume signals, neuron counts, and converting image sequences into videos.",
  "sources": "File reads from numpy arrays (np.load), image files (glob), and external commands via subprocess (ffmpeg). Data is read from npy files, image files, and video frames.",
  "sinks": "External subprocess calls to ffmpeg for video encoding, reading data from numpy files, and image files for visualization.",
  "flows": "Data flows from numpy files and image files into processing functions, then into visualization outputs, and finally into media files via subprocess calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Subprocess calls are standard for media encoding. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard data loading, visualization, and media conversion functions. No obfuscated code or malicious logic is present. Subprocess calls to ffmpeg are typical and controlled. File handling is straightforward. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are evident. The malware score is set to 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior. The risk score is low (~0.2), mainly due to subprocess usage, which is common in such workflows. Confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate set of utility functions for neuroscience data processing and visualization. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
