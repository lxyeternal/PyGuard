  "purpose": "Utility functions for neuroscience imaging workflows, including video smoothing, data loading, visualization, and fluorescence signal processing.",
  "sources": "File paths for input videos, data files (npz, tif, npy), and external subprocess call to ffmpeg for video processing.",
  "sinks": "External subprocess call to ffmpeg with input and output paths; file I/O for data loading and saving images.",
  "flows": "Input paths passed directly to subprocess without explicit sanitization; data loaded from disk; visualization rendered via matplotlib.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The subprocess call could be exploited if input paths are maliciously crafted, but this is standard in media processing scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of utility functions for scientific data processing and visualization. The subprocess call to ffmpeg is a common pattern but could pose command injection risks if input paths are untrusted. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Data loading and processing functions are straightforward and standard. The visualization functions include overlays and scalebars, typical for imaging workflows. Overall, the code appears legitimate and safe, with minimal security concern primarily related to subprocess input validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility suite for neuroscience imaging data processing. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident. The only minor concern is the subprocess call with user-controlled paths, which should be validated if inputs are untrusted. Scores are consistent with this assessment.",
