  "purpose": "The code provides various utility functions for image processing, video smoothing, data loading, and visualization in a neuroscience imaging analysis pipeline.",
  "sources": "Reads input files such as video files for processing, numpy arrays ('F.npy', 'Fneu.npy', 'spks.npy', 'iscell.npy'), TIFF image files for stacking, and environment variables for subprocess commands.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess to execute ffmpeg commands, which could potentially be exploited if input paths are untrusted; loads data files from disk that could contain malicious data or corrupted files; outputs figures and saves images if specified.",
  "flows": "Input files (video, TIFF, numpy data) are read into the program; ffmpeg command constructed and executed via subprocess with input file paths; data loaded from disk and processed for visualization; figures saved to disk if save paths provided.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials or secrets observed. The subprocess command for ffmpeg dynamically constructs the command string but only based on function parameters. No obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or unusual control flows identified. The code handles external files, but no suspicious patterns detected beyond normal usage.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily contains standard data processing and visualization routines, with functions for video frame interpolation via ffmpeg, data loading from numpy files, image resizing, and plotting. The subprocess call uses user-provided input paths without sanitization, which could be risky if paths are manipulated maliciously, but no malicious intent or backdoors are present. All file reads are from disk; no network activity or data exfiltration code is present. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs detected. The use of scipy, numpy, and matplotlib appears to be for normal image analysis tasks. Overall, the code seems to perform typical analysis functions with no clear malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is primarily utility functions for neuroscience imaging analysis, with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The subprocess call could pose a risk if input paths are malicious, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious. No backdoors, data theft, or covert operations are present. The code appears safe for use in its described context.",
