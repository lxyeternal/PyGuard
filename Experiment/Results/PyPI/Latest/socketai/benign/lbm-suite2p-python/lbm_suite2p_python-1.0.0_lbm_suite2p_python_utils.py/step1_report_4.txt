{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for video processing, image manipulation, data loading, visualization, and signal processing in a neuroscience imaging context.",
  "sources": "Input files via os, subprocess, tifffile.imread, np.load, np.load with file paths, and user-supplied parameters; environment variables indirectly through subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run executes ffmpeg command; potential for command injection if input paths are untrusted (but only if inputs are externally supplied without validation).",
  "flows": "Input paths and parameters flow into ffmpeg subprocess; data loaded from numpy files flow into visualization and analysis functions; no direct untrusted data flow into sensitive system functions beyond subprocess.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to run ffmpeg with user-supplied file paths; no input sanitization or validation shown for paths used in subprocess command. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The rest of the code performs standard scientific computing tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script appears to be a typical scientific data processing toolkit for neuroscience imaging data. The subprocess call to ffmpeg could be risky if input_path or output_path are user-controlled and not sanitized, which might allow command injection. However, this is a common pattern for media processing and not inherently malicious. The remaining code loads data, performs image manipulations, and visualizations without suspicious or malicious behavior. No hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity detected. Use of third-party libraries is typical and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for data processing and visualization with a potentially risky subprocess call that could be exploited if inputs are untrusted. No evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage was found in the code. The main concern is ensuring input paths for subprocess are validated if supplied externally.",
