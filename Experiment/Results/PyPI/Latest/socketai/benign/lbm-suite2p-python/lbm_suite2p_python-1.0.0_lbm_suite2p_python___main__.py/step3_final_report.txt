  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for the LBM-Suite2p pipeline, orchestrating file input, configuration loading, and processing calls.",
  "sources": "np.load() with args.ops (user-supplied .npy file), command-line arguments for data and save paths.",
  "sinks": "External processing functions (lsp.run_plane, lsp.run_volume), no direct data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Configuration loaded via np.load() (source) potentially used in processing functions (sinks), controlled by CLI args.",
  "anomalies": "Use of np.load() with allow_pickle=True on external files; no validation or sanitization of input files; standard code structure.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that loads configuration data from a user-supplied .npy file using pickle-enabled loading, then processes image files or directories via external libraries. The main security concern is the potential execution of arbitrary code if the npy file is maliciously crafted, which is a known risk of pickle loading. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code relies on trusted external libraries and standard file handling. The risk stems from the pickle loading method, not from the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical scientific data processing CLI with a known security caveat: loading pickled data from untrusted sources can execute arbitrary code. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is detected. The main security risk is the potential exploitation via malicious pickle files, which warrants caution but does not constitute active malicious behavior.",
