  "conclusion": "The code is a typical scientific data processing CLI with a known security caveat: loading pickled data from untrusted sources can execute arbitrary code. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is detected. The main security risk is the potential exploitation via malicious pickle files, which warrants caution but does not constitute active malicious behavior."
