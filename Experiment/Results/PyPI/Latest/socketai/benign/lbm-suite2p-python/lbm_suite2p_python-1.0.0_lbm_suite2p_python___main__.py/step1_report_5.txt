{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to run a data processing pipeline involving loading parameters, reading input files, and executing image processing functions for either single files or directories.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (args.ops, args.data, args.save, args.subdir, args.max_depth), loads a .npy file (np.load), reads files from directory (mbo.get_files), and input paths (Path).",
  "sinks": "Uses functions from external libraries (lsp.run_plane, lsp.run_volume) which likely process data, but no untrusted data is directly written or transmitted by this script itself. The code does not send data over the network or write sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> np.load (for ops) -> file/directory validation -> calls external processing functions with parameters from untrusted input -> processing results returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Use of external libraries appears standard. No obfuscated code or misleading variable usage observed. No dynamic code execution, no network connections, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility for data processing. It loads parameters from a .npy file, reads input files, manages directories, and calls external processing functions. No untrusted data is directly written or transmitted; all operations appear standard. There are no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious behaviors, and no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. External libraries are used for processing, which is typical in such pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data processing CLI script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms. It performs expected operations based on input parameters with standard practices.",
