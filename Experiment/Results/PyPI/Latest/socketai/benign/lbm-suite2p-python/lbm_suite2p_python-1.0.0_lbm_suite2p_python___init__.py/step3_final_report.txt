  "purpose": "Module setup and API exposure for a Python package, including optional dependency check and version reading.",
  "sources": "Local module imports, version file read, optional 'suite3d' import.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Imports and version read occur during module initialization; no data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .module import *' which can obscure imported symbols, but is common in package init files.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package initialization script. It imports internal modules, handles optional dependencies safely, reads version info from a local file, and defines public API exports. There are no dynamic code executions, network activities, or data leaks involving untrusted sources. The wildcard import is a style concern but not malicious. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, typical for a Python package's __init__.py, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The minimal risk score reflects the use of wildcard imports, which is a common practice in such contexts but not inherently dangerous.",
