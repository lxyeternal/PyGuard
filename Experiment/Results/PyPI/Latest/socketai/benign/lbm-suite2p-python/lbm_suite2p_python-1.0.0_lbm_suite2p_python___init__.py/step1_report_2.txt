{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports utility functions and defines an API for a larger Python package related to volume rendering, run analysis, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads the local version file (__file__).parent / 'VERSION') and imports modules and functions from relative paths (.utils, .volume, .run_lsp, .zplane).",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present. No network, file writing, or system command execution is evident.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules and functions, then reading a version string from a local file, and finally defining an export list (__all__).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The dynamic import of 'suite3d' is straightforward with a fallback, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages imports and module setup. It conditionally imports 'suite3d', sets a boolean flag accordingly, reads a version string from a local file, and defines an export list. All activities are standard for a Python package's __init__.py or module setup. No malicious behavior, external data exfiltration, or security risks are detected. The code does not execute untrusted data or include potentially malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, performing safe imports, version reading, and export definitions. There are no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
