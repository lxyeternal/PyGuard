{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for processing, registering, and saving calcium imaging data, creating jobs, and interfacing with Suite2p for downstream analysis.",
  "sources": "User-supplied file paths, environment variables (indirectly via Path and possibly external metadata), and data loaded through mbo.get_metadata.",
  "sinks": "Writing binary files (.bin), saving numpy arrays (.npy), and creating directories, which could be exploited if filenames or paths are maliciously manipulated.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input files (tif_list, metadata), through processing steps (get_registered_movie), and into output files (binary files, npy, saved movies).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code uses standard libraries and conventions. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data loading, job management, data processing, and saving operations. No suspicious network activity, system commands, or secret handling is evident. Functions are straightforward, and data is processed via standard numpy and dask operations. File I/O is managed carefully, with proper path handling and explicit file creation. There are no signs of hidden backdoors or malicious logic. The only potential concern is reliance on external paths and metadata, which are standard in data pipelines. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate scientific data processing pipeline without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data processing script for calcium imaging data with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles data loading, processing, and saving in a typical manner for scientific workflows. No malicious code, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are evident.",
