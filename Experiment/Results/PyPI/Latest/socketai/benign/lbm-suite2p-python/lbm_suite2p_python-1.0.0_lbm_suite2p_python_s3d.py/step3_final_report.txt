{
  "purpose": "The code manages data processing pipelines for neuroscience imaging datasets, including job creation, data loading, saving, and registration routines.",
  "sources": "File system reads for TIFFs, metadata, registered movies, and binary data; external library calls for data processing.",
  "sinks": "File writes for binary data (.bin), numpy arrays (.npy), and directory management; no network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from files, processed in memory, padded or cropped, then saved back to disk as binary and numpy files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected. Standard file operations and data handling routines.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical scientific data management tasks: creating or loading jobs, processing movie data, padding/cropping, and saving in Suite2p-compatible formats. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present. File deletions and overwrites are standard practices for data management. External libraries used are common in scientific workflows. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are observed. The code's behavior aligns with legitimate data pipeline operations, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign scientific data pipeline with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent and justified based on the analysis.",
