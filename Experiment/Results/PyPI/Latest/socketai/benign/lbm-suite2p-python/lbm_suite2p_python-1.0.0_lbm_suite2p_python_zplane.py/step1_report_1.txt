{
  "purpose": "This code provides visualization tools for neuronal fluorescence trace data, including plotting stacked traces, creating animated visualizations, and plotting noise distribution histograms.",
  "sources": "Data is read from numpy arrays and dictionaries (via load_traces), as well as from input parameters such as noise_levels. External dependencies include matplotlib for visualization.",
  "sinks": "Data is saved as image files (.png) and videos (.mp4) using plt.savefig() and FuncAnimation.save(). No data is sent over network or stored externally in this code segment.",
  "flows": "Input data (neural traces) are processed for visualization, with flow from data loading to plotting functions. Visual elements (images, videos) are generated and saved locally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code relies on standard libraries and functions for plotting and data handling. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a visualization module for neuronal data, with functions for plotting static and animated traces and noise distributions. It uses standard Python packages and follows typical visualization patterns. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are present. The only file output is image and video files generated locally, consistent with normal use. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malware are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign visualization utility with no malicious intent. It securely processes and visualizes neuroscience data, with no suspicious or harmful behavior observed.",
