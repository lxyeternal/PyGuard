{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for visualizing neural fluorescence traces, including plotting stacked traces, creating animations, and plotting noise distributions, primarily for data analysis and visualization in neuroscience.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from variables and function parameters; loads trace data from external sources via load_traces() and dff_percentile() functions; reads image data from numpy arrays.",
  "sinks": "Uses matplotlib functions to generate and save figures; writes output images to specified file paths. No use of untrusted data in system calls or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data is loaded or passed into plotting functions; data is processed for visualization; visualizations are saved as image files; animation frames are generated and saved to a video file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; the code relies on standard libraries and well-defined data processing and visualization steps. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden functionalities are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of visualization functions for neuroscience data. It loads and processes fluorescence traces, applies percentile-based baseline correction, creates animated visualizations, and saves plots. The functions use common plotting and data manipulation libraries without any indications of malicious behavior. There are no network connections, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The code structure is consistent with legitimate scientific visualization workflows. No anomalies or obfuscation techniques are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data visualization script for neuroscience research. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. Its purpose is to generate plots and animations from fluorescence data with no evident security risks.",
