{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for visualizing neural fluorescence traces, including plotting and animation, and saving distribution plots of noise levels across neurons.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as 'f', 'noise_levels', and 'save_path'. It also loads data via 'load_traces' and 'dff_percentile' functions from an external module 'lbm_suite2p_python'.",
  "sinks": "The code writes figures to disk via 'plt.savefig' and 'save_path / filename'. It does not perform any network operations, system commands, or data exfiltration. No data leaks or untrusted data effects are observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (neural traces or noise levels) is processed within functions; processed data is visualized and saved as images. No untrusted data flows to system commands or external services.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears focused on data visualization with standard plotting libraries. No obfuscation, misleading variable names, or unnecessary dynamic code execution is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively uses standard Python libraries (math, numpy, matplotlib) and functions from an external module to load and process neural data. It creates plots and animations, saves images, and does not include any network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration. There are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage, and the functions are consistent with their stated purpose. The code structure and formatting are clear and standard, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears safe, with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a visualization tool for neural trace data and noise level distribution. There is no evidence of malware, sabotage, or supply chain threats.",
