{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization and animation functions for neuronal fluorescence data, including plotting traces, creating animated scrollings, and plotting noise distributions.",
  "sources": "External functions load_traces and dff_percentile from lbm_suite2p_python; data is read from numpy arrays; file outputs are saved images and videos.",
  "sinks": "Generated images and videos saved locally; no network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data loaded via external functions -> processed and plotted -> saved as images/videos.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard neuroscience visualization utility relying on common libraries. It does not include network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns. External dependencies are assumed safe. The code outputs visualizations only, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and intended for data visualization. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
