{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to process volumetric and plane-wise imaging data using Suite2p, including registration, segmentation, plotting, and grid search parameter tuning.",
  "sources": "Input files: input_file_list, input_tiff; Data read from TIFF files, numpy arrays, and environment variables. File existence checks and path manipulations are present.",
  "sinks": "Saving results (NPY, PNG, MP4 files), concatenation of spike data, model saving, and plotting functions. No untrusted data directly influences system commands or network communications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input files through processing functions like run_plane and run_volume, with intermediate data stored and loaded from disk. Visualization functions generate images and videos. No clear flow of untrusted input directly to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except blocks that suppress exceptions; dynamic import of optional modules; file existence checks; processing of numpy arrays; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code features detected; no malicious network activity or system disruption mechanisms evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed for image processing workflows, utilizing file checks, data loading, and saving. It employs standard libraries for scientific computing and visualization. No suspicious or malicious code patterns such as network activity, backdoors, or credential theft mechanisms are found. Error handling appears routine, and there are no signs of obfuscation or hiding malicious intent. The functions mainly manipulate files and arrays, typical for data analysis pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data processing script for neuroscience imaging analysis. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code follows standard practices for such applications without suspicious elements.",
