{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to process volumetric imaging datasets using Suite2p, including running individual planes, full volume processing, and grid search over parameters, with visualization and result saving.",
  "sources": "File system reads (os, Path, shutil), external library imports, functions reading input TIFF files, loading/saving images, and configuration parameters from the file system.",
  "sinks": "File writing for outputs such as npy files, images, movies, and models; plotting functions; network calls are not evident; no apparent direct data exfiltration or command execution.",
  "flows": "Input TIFF files are loaded and processed; results saved to specific directories; visualizations generated and saved; models fitted to activity data; grid search modifies parameters and reruns processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious hardcoded IPs, or malicious commands. Use of try-except blocks for error handling is typical. The code dynamically loads external modules. No obfuscated code, no hidden commands, or code that performs suspicious network activity. The only potential concern is the conditional import of rastermap and utils without further use, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The script appears to be a well-structured processing pipeline for imaging data, with standard libraries, optional dependencies, and typical data handling operations. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system sabotage. The code operates locally, loading files, processing images, saving results, and plotting. It does not include any code that manipulates or leaks sensitive data, executes shell commands, or establishes network connections. The use of exception handling and safe file operations suggests standard robustness practices rather than malicious obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate imaging data processing pipeline for volumetric datasets with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It performs file I/O, data processing, and visualization without suspicious or harmful behavior.",
