{
  "purpose": "The code processes volumetric calcium imaging data, including registration, segmentation, visualization, and statistical analysis, primarily for neuroimaging datasets.",
  "sources": "Reads TIFF files, numpy arrays, and other local data files; loads metadata and intermediate results from disk.",
  "sinks": "Saves processed images, movies, models, and statistical results locally; deletes raw data files; generates plots and visualizations.",
  "flows": "Sequential data processing pipeline involving file I/O, data analysis, visualization, and cleanup, with optional modules and exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscation detected. File deletion of raw data is standard but should be used cautiously.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate scientific data processing with robust exception handling. It reads and writes standard formats (npy, png, mp4), manages files carefully, and includes optional dependencies that are benign. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation are present. File cleanup steps are typical in data pipelines but could be misused if misconfigured. No network activity or secret handling is observed. The overall structure and logic are consistent with a standard neuroimaging analysis pipeline.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured scientific processing pipeline with no malicious or sabotage intent. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is justified by routine file operations and data visualization tasks. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious sabotage.",
