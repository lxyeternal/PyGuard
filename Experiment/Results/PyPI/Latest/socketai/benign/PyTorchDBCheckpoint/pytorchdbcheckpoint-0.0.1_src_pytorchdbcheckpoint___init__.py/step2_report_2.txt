  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Confirms the import is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious activity.  \n- The confidence is high (0.9), and all scores (malware, obfuscated, risk) are zero.  \n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate; the code is benign and the scoring is appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the import's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.  \n- Confidence is even higher (1.0).  \n- Scores are all zero, consistent with the benign nature.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Reiterates the benign nature of the import, noting that the actual behavior depends on the implementation of `PostgresHandler`, which isn't shown.  \n- Confidence is 0.8; scores are zero for malware and obfuscation, and securityRisk is 0.0 or 0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** The cautious note about implementation is good. The scores are appropriate given the limited context.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Similar to previous reports, with a slight increase in confidence (0.8).  \n- Security risk is noted as 0.1, which is low but not zero.  \n- Since the import itself is benign, this is acceptable.  \n- **Assessment:** Reasonable; no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Again, confirms the import is benign with no anomalies.  \n- Confidence is high (0.9), and scores are all zero or negligible.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports agree that the code snippet is a simple import statement with no malicious activity, data flow, or anomalies.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are very low, which is appropriate given the limited code context.\n- Malware scores are zero across all reports, which is justified.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The actual security concern hinges on what `PostgresHandler` does when used, not on the import statement itself.\n- Since no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present, the scores should remain low.\n- The only minor point is the `securityRisk` score of 0.1 in some reports; this could be justified if the implementation of `PostgresHandler` is unknown and potentially dangerous, but based solely on the import statement, it's probably overly cautious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 or 0.1, depending on whether you want to be cautious about the imported class's implementation. Given only the import, 0.0 is appropriate.\n- **Overall assessment:** The code is benign, and the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n- The code snippet is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary unless additional context reveals malicious behavior in `PostgresHandler`.\n\n**Final malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence at hand.",
