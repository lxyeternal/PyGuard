  "purpose": "Importing PostgresHandler class or function from a local module named main.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the PostgresHandler from the current package/module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present in this single line of code.",
  "flows": "The import could lead to use of PostgresHandler, but this line alone does not execute such flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are apparent in this import statement alone.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple import statement that pulls in a class or function named PostgresHandler from a local module named main. No executable code, data handling, or malicious behavior is present in this line. The security and maliciousness depend on the implementation of PostgresHandler itself, which is not provided. Without additional context or code, this line alone appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It merely imports a component that may handle database operations. The security implications depend on the implementation of PostgresHandler, which is not visible here.",
