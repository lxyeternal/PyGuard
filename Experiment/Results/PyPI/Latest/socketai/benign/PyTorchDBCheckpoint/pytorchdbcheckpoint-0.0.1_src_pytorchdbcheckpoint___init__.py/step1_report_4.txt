{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'PostgresHandler' class or function from a module named 'main' within the same package, likely for database handling purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .main import PostgresHandler, which loads code from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this snippet only includes an import statement with no data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is a simple import statement that pulls 'PostgresHandler' from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or obfuscated code. Since the code is limited to an import, it does not provide enough context to suspect malicious intent. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a normal part of a larger project that handles PostgreSQL operations.",
