  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically.\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**  \nAll reports focus solely on a single import statement: `from .main import PostgresHandler`. There is no evidence of code execution, data handling, or network activity. The import is straightforward and typical in Python projects.\n\n2. **Potential Malicious Behavior & Anomalies**  \n- None of the reports identify any anomalies, suspicious patterns, or signs of malicious activity within this import statement.\n- The code is minimal, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.\n- The implementation details of `PostgresHandler` are not provided, so any malicious activity could be hidden within that class, but based on the import statement alone, there is no indication of malicious intent.\n\n3. **Score Justification & Consistency**  \n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of any evidence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are mostly at 0.1, indicating a negligible risk based on this snippet alone, which seems reasonable given the context.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.8 to 1), consistent with the clear and benign nature of the code snippet.\n\n4. **Assessment of Claims & Assumptions**  \n- No reports claim or assume any vulnerabilities or malicious activity beyond the import statement.\n- The security implications depend on the implementation of `PostgresHandler`, but that is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation & Personal Estimate**  \nGiven the evidence:\n- The code is benign.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present in the provided snippet.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimates** for the overall scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (negligible, as the import could potentially be misused if the imported class is malicious, but there's no evidence here)\n\n**Final note:** The security concern hinges entirely on the implementation of `PostgresHandler`, which isn't visible. If that class contains malicious code, the risk could be higher, but based solely on this import statement, the risk remains minimal.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The reports are accurate in their assessment that this import statement is benign.  \n- The scores are appropriate given the limited context.  \n- No adjustments are necessary unless further code reveals malicious behavior within `PostgresHandler`.",
