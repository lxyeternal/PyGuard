  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement importing PostgresHandler from a local module. There are no input/output operations, data flows, or suspicious behaviors visible. Without additional context, this appears to be a normal import statement, possibly used elsewhere for database handling.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet alone shows no malicious activity or security risks. It is a standard import statement. No malware or obfuscation detected. The security risk is negligible based on this code alone.",
