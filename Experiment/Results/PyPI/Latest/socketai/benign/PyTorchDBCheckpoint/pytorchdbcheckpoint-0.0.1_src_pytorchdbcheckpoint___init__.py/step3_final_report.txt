  "purpose": "Evaluate the security implications of the import statement 'from .main import PostgresHandler' in the context of supply chain security.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources within the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution or usage of PostgresHandler methods, which are not shown; no direct sink in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Importing PostgresHandler from .main; actual data or control flow depends on subsequent usage, not present here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in the import statement; straightforward and standard syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with no embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The security assessment relies on the implementation of PostgresHandler, which is not provided. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.0-0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the snippet. Given the minimal context, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risk in this import alone.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and poses no security threat based solely on this code. The overall scores are appropriate; further analysis of PostgresHandler's implementation is necessary for a comprehensive security assessment.",
