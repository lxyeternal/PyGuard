  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for checkpoint management with no malicious intent. The main security concern is pickle serialization, which should be mitigated by ensuring database integrity. No signs of malware or obfuscation are detected. The overall security risk is moderate due to pickle, but the code itself is safe and standard for this purpose."
