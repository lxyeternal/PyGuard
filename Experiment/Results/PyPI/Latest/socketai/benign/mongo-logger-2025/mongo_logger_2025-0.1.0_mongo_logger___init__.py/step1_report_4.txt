  "purpose": "Importing the MongoLogger class from the local main module, likely for logging purposes within the project.",
  "sources": "The import statement, which loads a class definition from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow paths are present in this single line of code; no untrusted data handling or external effects are observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code only performs a static import with no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code imports a class called MongoLogger from a relative module named main. It appears to be a standard import statement with no malicious or suspicious characteristics. Since there are no function calls, data processing, or external communications, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is standard practice to import classes for logging or other purposes in Python projects.",
