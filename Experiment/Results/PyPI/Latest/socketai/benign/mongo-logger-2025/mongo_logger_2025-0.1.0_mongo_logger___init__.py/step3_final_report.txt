  "purpose": "Import the MongoLogger class from the local main module, likely for logging purposes within the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .main import MongoLogger reads the 'main' module in the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if MongoLogger is used improperly elsewhere, it could handle sensitive data or establish network connections, but this is outside the scope of this snippet.",
  "flows": "The import brings in the MongoLogger class into the namespace; any subsequent usage could involve data flows, but none are present here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns; the code is a straightforward import statement with no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import of MongoLogger from the local main module. No executable code, data flow, or suspicious activity is present. The import itself is benign, and the minimal code does not indicate any malicious intent. The security implications depend on how MongoLogger is used later, but from this snippet alone, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This import statement is standard and harmless. The code does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks based solely on this snippet. The scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated set to 0, and a very low security risk score (0.1) in one report reflecting potential concerns if the imported module is misused later, but no evidence supports this here.",
