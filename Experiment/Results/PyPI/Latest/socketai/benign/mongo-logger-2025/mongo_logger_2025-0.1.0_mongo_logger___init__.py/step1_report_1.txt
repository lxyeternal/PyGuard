{
  "purpose": "Importing the MongoLogger class from a local module named main",
  "sources": "The code imports from .main, which suggests reading code from a local module within the package",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this line",
  "flows": "The import itself does not create data flows; it prepares for usage elsewhere in the package",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, and there are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated elements, or unusual constructs present",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a relative import of MongoLogger from a local module. It is a standard Python import statement and does not include any executable logic, data handling, or potentially malicious behavior. Since it is isolated and does not involve data transmission, user input, or dynamic code execution, there are no security concerns at this point.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is a typical pattern used in modular Python codebases.",
