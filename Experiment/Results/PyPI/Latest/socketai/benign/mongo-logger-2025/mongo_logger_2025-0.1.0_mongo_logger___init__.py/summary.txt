  "conclusion": "This import statement is standard and harmless. The code does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks based solely on this snippet. The scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated set to 0, and a very low security risk score (0.1) in one report reflecting potential concerns if the imported module is misused later, but no evidence supports this here."
