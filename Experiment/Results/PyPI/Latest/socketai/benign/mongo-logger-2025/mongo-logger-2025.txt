      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or security issues detected. The package name alone does not imply malicious intent, and the dependency on 'pymongo' is common for MongoDB-related packages. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, with high confidence."

      "conclusion": "This import statement is standard and harmless. The code does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks based solely on this snippet. The scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated set to 0, and a very low security risk score (0.1) in one report reflecting potential concerns if the imported module is misused later, but no evidence supports this here."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are accurate and justified. Overall, the supply chain security risk for this dependency is minimal, and the code is safe for use in open-source projects."
