{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'mongo_logger_2025' Python package, specifying dependencies and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Package metadata fields, find_packages() for package discovery",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows present",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static configuration only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The package name suggests potential logging or MongoDB interaction, but the script itself only defines package info and dependencies. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. All dependencies are standard, and the code is readable and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or security issues detected. The package name alone does not imply malicious intent, and the dependency on 'pymongo' is common for MongoDB-related packages. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, with high confidence.",
