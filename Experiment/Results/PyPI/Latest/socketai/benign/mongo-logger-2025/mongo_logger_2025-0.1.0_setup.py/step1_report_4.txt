{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'mongo_logger_2025' with its dependencies using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the package name, version, packages list via find_packages(), and required dependencies 'pymongo'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no network, file, or environment variable operations present.",
  "flows": "None identified; the setup script solely defines package metadata and dependencies without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward setup configuration with no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools. It calls setup() with package name 'mongo_logger_2025', version '0.1.0', and uses find_packages() to include all packages in the directory. The only dependency listed is 'pymongo', a standard MongoDB driver. No code execution, data handling, or network activity occurs within this script. It appears to be a typical package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It merely specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
