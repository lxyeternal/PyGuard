{
  "purpose": "Download and package the Temporal CLI binary tailored to the platform, placing it in the project's source directory.",
  "sources": "Platform detection via platform.system() and platform.machine(); URL construction for GitHub release assets.",
  "sinks": "Downloading binary archive via urllib.request; extracting binary from zip/tar.gz; setting executable permissions.",
  "flows": "Platform info → URL and filename determination → download archive → extract binary → set permissions.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution; reliance on external source without checksum verification.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard download and extraction based on platform detection, with no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. It correctly handles platform-specific asset naming and extraction. The primary security concern is the lack of checksum or signature verification of downloaded binaries, which introduces supply chain risk but does not indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward and uses common libraries. No backdoors or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build utility for fetching prebuilt binaries, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The main security issue is the absence of binary verification, which could be exploited if the external source is compromised. Overall, it is a safe and standard implementation, but adding checksum validation would improve security.",
