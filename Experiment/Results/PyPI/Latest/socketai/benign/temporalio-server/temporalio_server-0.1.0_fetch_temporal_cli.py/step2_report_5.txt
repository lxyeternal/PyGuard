  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code logic, and assess the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a build hook that downloads prebuilt binaries from GitHub based on platform detection.\n- It performs standard operations: download, extract, set permissions, cleanup.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The main concern is supply chain risk: downloading binaries without checksum or signature verification.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Finds no malicious behavior.\n- High confidence (0.9).\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.2 (due to supply chain risk).\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Correctly notes that the code is straightforward and safe.\n- The logic for platform detection and extraction appears correct.\n- No issues with code correctness or malicious intent.\n\n**Score suggestions:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct).\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct).\n- Risk: 0.2 seems reasonable, given supply chain concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid and accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Highlights that binaries are downloaded from GitHub without checksum validation.\n- Correctly points out supply chain risk.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n- Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No malicious code, but the lack of verification is a security concern.\n- The report's reasoning is sound.\n- The code's logic is straightforward, and no suspicious behavior is detected.\n\n**Score suggestions:**\n- Malware: 0 (appropriate).\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.3 (slightly higher than others, justified by the lack of verification).\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate. No modifications necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to others, emphasizes that the code is a legitimate build utility.\n- No malicious activity detected.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n- Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Correctly identifies that the code is standard and safe.\n- Reiterates the supply chain risk due to unverified binaries.\n\n**Score suggestions:**\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk: 0.2 seems appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Finds no malicious intent.\n- Notes standard practices.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n- Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward.\n- No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors.\n- Correctly notes the supply chain risk.\n\n**Score suggestions:**\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk: 0.1 (low, given the nature of the code).\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate. No adjustments.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to others, emphasizes that the code performs standard download and extraction.\n- No malicious code.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n- Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Correctly describes the code's behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.\n\n**Score suggestions:**\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk: 0.1 (appropriate).\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports are 0, matching the code clarity.\n- **Security risk:** Slight variation, mostly 0.1–0.3, justified by supply chain concerns due to lack of binary verification.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected).\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code).\n- **Risk:** 0.2–0.3 (due to supply chain risks, no verification).\n\n**I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (balanced, considering the lack of verification but no malicious intent).\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical build hook that downloads prebuilt binaries without verification, which is a known supply chain risk but not malicious in itself. The reports are consistent and accurate. No modifications needed.",
