{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom build hook for Hatch to download and package the Temporal CLI binary during the Python package build process.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from build environment attributes and system platform information; it also fetches remote files via HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "Downloads are saved directly to the local filesystem, and the binary files are extracted and set as executable; no untrusted data is directly executed.",
  "flows": "System platform info determines download URL; HTTP response streams are saved as files; archive contents are extracted to the target directory; permissions are modified for executables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code relies on standard Python modules and common patterns for downloading and extracting files. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs legitimate download and extraction of pre-compiled binaries from a trusted GitHub release URL, based on platform detection. It cleans target directories before download, handles different archive formats (.tar.gz and .zip), and sets execute permissions appropriately. The URL construction appears standard and based on known release assets. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code handles exceptions properly and includes logging for traceability. The overall logic is straightforward and consistent with expected build processes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign build utility script for downloading and packaging a CLI binary. There are no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs its task in a controlled, predictable manner, with no suspicious behavior or malware indications.",
