      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build utility for fetching prebuilt binaries, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The main security issue is the absence of binary verification, which could be exploited if the external source is compromised. Overall, it is a safe and standard implementation, but adding checksum validation would improve security."
