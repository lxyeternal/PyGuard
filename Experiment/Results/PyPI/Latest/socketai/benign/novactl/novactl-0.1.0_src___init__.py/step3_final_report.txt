  "flows": "No data flows; code contains only static comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is purely metadata comments with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment block with author details, no executable statements, data processing, or code logic. No sources or sinks are present, and there are no suspicious behaviors or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign, metadata-only content. Given the absence of executable code or suspicious patterns, the code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign metadata comment with no malicious or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and accurate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
