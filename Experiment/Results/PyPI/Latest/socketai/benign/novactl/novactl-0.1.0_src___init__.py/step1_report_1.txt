  "purpose": "The code appears to be a header or metadata comment block that provides author information and contact details.",
  "sources": "No actual code or data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways observed.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of author contact information in comments is not unusual; no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment block with metadata: encoding declaration, author name, and email address. No executable code, input handling, or data processing is included. Without additional code, there are no source or sink points, nor any observable flow or anomalies. The code structure is typical for a Python file header.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code contains only metadata comments with no executable or suspicious content. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on the available content.",
