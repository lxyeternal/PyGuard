  "purpose": "This code serves as metadata, including author information and encoding declaration, with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "Author comments and encoding declaration",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data flows, or suspicious patterns; only comments and encoding info present",
  "analysis": "The code contains only metadata comments and a UTF-8 encoding declaration, with no executable statements, data sources, or sinks. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the lack of any suspicious patterns or data handling. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, with high confidence in this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely metadata with no malicious or obfuscated content. The current scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified and should remain unchanged.",
