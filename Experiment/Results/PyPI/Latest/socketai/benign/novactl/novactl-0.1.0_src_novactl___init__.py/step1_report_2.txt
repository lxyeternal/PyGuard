  "flows": "No data flows or execution flows evident in the provided snippet",
  "anomalies": "Presence of author contact info with no functional code, which could be used for obfuscation if combined with malicious content elsewhere, but no such code present here",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a UTF-8 encoding declaration and a comment block containing author and email metadata. There is no executable code, data input/output, or suspicious constructs. Since this is just a header, it provides no malicious behavior or security risks by itself.",
