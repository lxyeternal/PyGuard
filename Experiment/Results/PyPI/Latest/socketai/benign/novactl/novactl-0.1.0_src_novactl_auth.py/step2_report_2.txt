  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code's behavior, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the code's behavior:**\n- Implements OAuth 2.0 device flow, token validation, refresh, and storage.\n- Uses keyring for secure token storage.\n- Fetches JWKS for JWT validation.\n- Has network retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter.\n- Can disable SSL verification based on config.\n- Handles user prompts and console outputs.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n- No suspicious network activity or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard OAuth 2.0 client with token handling.\n- **Findings:** No malware, no obfuscation, SSL verification can be disabled.\n- **Security concern:** Disabling SSL verification can be risky but is configurable.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Verdict:** Consistent. No malicious behavior, just a minor security concern with SSL verification.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar OAuth 2.0 implementation, detailed token validation.\n- **Findings:** Disabling SSL verification, no malicious code, standard practices.\n- **Security concern:** Same as above, configurable SSL verification.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3\n- **Verdict:** Consistent. No signs of malware, just a configurable security risk.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same core functionality, secure token handling.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, SSL verification can be disabled.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Verdict:** Consistent. No malicious activity, minor security concern.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** OAuth 2.0 device flow, token validation, refresh.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, SSL verification is configurable.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Verdict:** Consistent. No signs of malware, standard practices.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** OAuth2 client with token management.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard validation.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Verdict:** Consistent. No malicious signs.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which aligns with the code's behavior. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports agree on 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher due to optional SSL verification disablement, but this is a configurable security feature, not malicious.\n\n### **My final estimates:**\n\n| Metric             | Score   | Justification                                                                                   |\n|--------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0       | No malicious code, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation present.                     |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       | Clear, readable code with no obfuscation or hidden logic.                                    |\n| Security Risk      | 0.2-0.3 | Due to optional SSL verification disablement, which can be exploited if misconfigured.      |\n\n**Recommended final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no signs of malware)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear code)\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (minor, configuration-based security concern)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is a legitimate, standard OAuth 2.0 client implementation with robust token handling, retries, and validation. The only notable security concern is the optional disabling of SSL verification, which should be used cautiously.\n\n**No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent has been detected.**",
