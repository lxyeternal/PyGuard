{
  "purpose": "The code handles loading, validating, processing, and saving configuration data for the 'novactl' CLI tool, including schema validation, logging setup, and derived value calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from a YAML file at a path determined by environment variables or defaults; reads schema JSON from a file; reads environment variables for config path.",
  "sinks": "Writes log data to a rotating log file with structured JSON format; saves updated configuration to YAML file; outputs critical errors and validation issues to console.",
  "flows": "Reads config data from YAML file -> Validates config against schema -> Processes SSL verify and other derived values -> Saves config if default was just created -> Sets up logging based on config -> Uses config data for further endpoint derivations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Logging and configuration handling appear standard. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network calls, no hidden backdoors or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration management: loading YAML configs, schema validation, logging setup, and saving defaults. It handles exceptions appropriately, uses environment variables for path flexibility, and derives additional config values. All operations seem consistent with a typical secure configuration handler. There are no indications of malicious code, such as data theft, network exfiltration, or backdoors. The logging uses structured JSON, which is standard. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated features, or covert behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured configuration handler for a CLI application, with proper validation, logging, and file handling. No malicious or suspicious behaviors were identified.",
