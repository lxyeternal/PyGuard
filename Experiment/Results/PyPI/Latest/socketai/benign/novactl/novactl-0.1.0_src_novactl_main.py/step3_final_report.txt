{
  "purpose": "This code implements a CLI tool for OAuth2 authentication management, including login, logout, token display, user info, and role retrieval, primarily for Keycloak/OAuth2 workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration via config.load_config(), retrieves tokens via auth.get_tokens(), user input via Typer commands, and JWT payloads via jose.jwt.get_unverified_claims().",
  "sinks": "Decodes JWT tokens for display, outputs user info and roles to console, potential token exposure in logs/console output.",
  "flows": "Sources (config, tokens, user input) flow into JWT decoding and display functions; tokens are decoded (unverified) for info display; no network or file modifications occur.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. JWT decoding is unverified but standard for display purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard OAuth2 CLI functions: login, logout, token display, user info, and role extraction. JWT tokens are decoded without verification solely for display, which is common. No network activity beyond token handling, no embedded secrets, and no obfuscation. Error handling and logging are typical. External modules are assumed benign. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard OAuth2 CLI utility with no malicious payloads or sabotage indicators. The scoring of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) is justified and consistent with its behavior.",
