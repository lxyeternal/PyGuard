{
  "purpose": "Main CLI application for 'novactl' providing authentication and user info features, interfacing with Keycloak/OAuth2.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration via 'config.load_config()', reads tokens via 'auth.get_tokens()', accesses environment/session data, user input via CLI arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses tokens for decoding JWTs, displaying user info, roles, token details, and making API calls (placeholder). No direct data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Loads config -> Checks auth status -> Decodes/validates tokens -> Displays user info or roles -> Handles login/logout -> Displays tokens based on commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Uses standard libraries for JWT, rich output, and CLI handling. No obfuscated code or unexpected dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages OAuth2 authentication via Keycloak, handles JWT tokens, and displays user info securely. Functions involve token decoding, validation, and user prompts, all typical for such CLI tools. No malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious backdoors evident. The use of 'jose' for token handling is standard, with no unsafe code patterns. No hardcoded secrets or dangerous code flows are present. The code structure aligns with a typical CLI auth helper, with proper exception handling and logging.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI application designed for user authentication and info display, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on standard libraries and follows common patterns for OAuth2 token management. There are no indicators of malware or supply chain sabotage.",
