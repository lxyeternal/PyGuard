{
  "purpose": "The script provides a CLI interface for authentication and user info management using Keycloak/OAuth2, with commands for login, logout, token management, and user info display.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from config.load_config(), reads tokens from auth.get_tokens(), reads environment variables (indirectly via auth or config modules), reads token claims (ID, access, refresh) for validation and display.",
  "sinks": "Decodes JWT tokens for display, prints user information and token details, interacts with auth module for login/logout, makes no network or file modifications directly within this code.",
  "flows": "Source: load_config() and auth.get_tokens() → Sink: Decoding and displaying token claims; Source: user input via CLI arguments → Sink: printing user info and token data; Source: auth.login() and auth.logout() → Sink: auth module handling token storage or clearance.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. Use of JWT decoding without verification is standard for inspection, not malicious. No obfuscated or complex code structures or dynamic code execution. No network connections or file modifications are evident here.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard CLI commands with proper error handling and authentication checks. It reads configuration and tokens via external modules. JWT tokens are decoded mainly for display purposes, with appropriate error handling. No embedded malicious payloads or suspicious behaviors are identified. The code does not perform any network operations, file writes, or system modifications that could be malicious. It follows typical patterns for CLI-based OAuth2 workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI wrapper for OAuth2-based authentication, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It primarily manages tokens and displays user info securely. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious activities are detected.",
