{
  "purpose": "Main CLI application for 'novactl', providing user authentication, token management, and user info display.",
  "sources": "Reads environment configuration via 'config.load_config()', and user input via CLI commands and options.",
  "sinks": "Decodes and displays JWT tokens, accesses token claims, and prints user information and roles; potential flow to expose token data.",
  "flows": "User input (commands/options) -> token retrieval -> token decoding/validation -> display of user info or token payload.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; token decoding is unverified but intended for display; no suspicious external network connections or code obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a CLI for managing OAuth2 tokens and user info, utilizing well-known libraries (typer, jose, rich). It performs token decoding and validation for display purposes, with proper error handling and logging. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident. The code’s structure appears legitimate, focusing on user interaction, token handling, and displaying information. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls are present. The use of unverified token claims is acceptable within a display context but does not introduce security flaws. The only minor consideration is that token decoding is unverified, which is normal for display but should not be used for security-critical validation. Overall, no malicious intent or malware is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI tool for OAuth2 token management and user info display. It exhibits no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or supply chain security issues. Its functions are typical for such applications, with proper error handling and clear user feedback. No security risks are identified.",
