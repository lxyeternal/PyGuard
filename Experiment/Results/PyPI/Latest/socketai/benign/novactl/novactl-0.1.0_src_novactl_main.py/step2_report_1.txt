  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scoring consistency, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard CLI for OAuth2 with config and tokens; no suspicious sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Decodes JWTs for display, no modifications or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code performs typical OAuth2 CLI functions, with JWT decoding solely for display, which is standard. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low, as it’s a CLI tool handling tokens securely).\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. The high confidence (0.95) is justified. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard token handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Decodes JWTs for display; no network or file modifications.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; token decoding is unverified but acceptable for display.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical CLI for token management, with no malicious behavior. Use of unverified claims is acceptable here.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—reading config, tokens, user input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Decodes JWTs, displays info, no malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate CLI for OAuth2; no signs of malware or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (even lower).\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard token management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Decodes JWTs, displays info, no malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical CLI for OAuth2 tokens; no malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Decodes JWTs, displays info, potential token exposure via console.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code; token display could leak info if logs are insecure.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malware or sabotage, but token exposure via console output is a minor security consideration.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is reasonable. The risk score reflects token exposure but no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly varied but generally low, reflecting the nature of the CLI token management tool.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The **malware scores** are appropriately set at 0 across all reports.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are correctly 0.\n- The **security risk scores** are reasonable; given the code's purpose and behavior, they are not overstated.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (low, due to token display and potential info leakage, but no active threats)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and do not overstate risks. The code appears secure and legitimate for its intended purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Ensure that in production environments, token output is secured or masked to prevent accidental leakage, but this is a common trade-off in CLI tools for debugging or info display.",
