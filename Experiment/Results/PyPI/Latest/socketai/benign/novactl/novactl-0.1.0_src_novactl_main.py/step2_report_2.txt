  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security issues, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard CLI for OAuth2 with configuration and token reading.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Decodes JWTs for display, no network/file modifications.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity; decoding without verification is normal for display.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code is typical for such tools.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (low, given token handling and display)  \n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard token display and user info.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Decodes JWTs for display, no network activity.  \n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate CLI for OAuth2; no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Manages OAuth2 tokens, displays info.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Decodes JWTs, no network activity.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or secrets; uses standard libraries.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, no signs of malware or sabotage.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (very low)  \n\n**Verdict:** Correct scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar OAuth2 CLI, token decoding, user info.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Decodes JWTs, displays info, no malicious activity.  \n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets; decoding without verification is typical for display.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent; standard pattern.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.1  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** OAuth2 CLI, token handling, user info.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Decodes JWTs, displays tokens and info.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; token exposure via console is typical but should be noted.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; responsible for token display.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, no obfuscation or code hiding detected.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero, mostly due to token handling and display, but no significant security risk is evident. The scores of 0.1–0.2 are appropriate.\n\n### My Overall Estimate\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent with reports)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the low but present risks of token exposure and decoding without verification)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scores are well-justified. No adjustments needed. The code appears to be a standard, legitimate CLI tool for OAuth2 authentication management, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
