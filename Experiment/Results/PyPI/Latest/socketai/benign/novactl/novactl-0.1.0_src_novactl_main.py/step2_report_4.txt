  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code to verify the claims, assess the reasoning, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes the code's purpose as a CLI for OAuth2 with Keycloak, matching the code's functions (login, logout, token display, user info). The sources (config.load_config(), auth.get_tokens()) and sinks (decoding JWTs, displaying info) are correctly identified.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Correctly notes no suspicious hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, and that JWT decoding without verification is standard for display purposes. No network or file modifications are present.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes the code is benign, with high confidence (0.95). The malware score of 0 aligns with this.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning is sound, and the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Same as above, consistent with the code's functions. Highlights token decoding for display, which is standard.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Correctly identifies no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious external activity, and normal use of JWT for display.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states the code is legitimate, with a malware score of 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-reasoned, scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes the code's flow—loading config, checking auth, decoding tokens, displaying info.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The use of unverified JWT decoding is acceptable for display, not validation.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states no signs of malicious activity, malware score 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Sound reasoning, scores justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly identifies the main functions, token handling, and display logic.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no malicious code, standard JWT decoding for display. The code relies on external modules assumed benign.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately classifies the code as legitimate, malware score 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment, scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Matches the code's purpose and flow.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, standard token decoding. Notes that token info is displayed, which could be sensitive, but this is typical.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states no malicious behavior, malware score 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's behavior—no malicious payloads, no network activity, no backdoors.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n\n- **Risk scores:** They are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security risk, mainly because the code handles tokens carefully, with proper error handling, and does not perform dangerous operations.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I concur with the provided scores.** There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The code is a standard CLI for OAuth2 token management, with proper error handling and no suspicious patterns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0.1-0.2 (consistent with reports)\n\n**In conclusion, the supply chain security posture of this code appears sound.**",
