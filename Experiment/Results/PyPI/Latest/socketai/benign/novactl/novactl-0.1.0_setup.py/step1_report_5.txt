{
  "purpose": "This code is used to set up and configure a Python package for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; standard setup() call does not read external data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; setup() is invoked without arguments.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and conventional; no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the setuptools library and calls setup() with default parameters. It performs a basic package setup with no custom configurations, arguments, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and typical for a minimal setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard minimal setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
