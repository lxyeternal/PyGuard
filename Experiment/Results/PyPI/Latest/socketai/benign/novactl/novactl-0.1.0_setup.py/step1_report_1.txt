  "purpose": "The code is used to configure and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'setuptools' module import statement.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; the code simply imports and calls setup() with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The setup() function is called without any arguments, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' module and calls setup() with default arguments. This is a minimal setup script typically used for package distribution. It contains no user input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. No source-to-sink data flow or anomalies are detected. The script appears benign and standard for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign and minimal setup script used for Python packaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
