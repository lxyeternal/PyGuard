  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'python_socket_test'.",
  "sources": "Reads the long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; setup configuration does not handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; standard setup process.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'open' to read 'README.md' without validation or sanitization; however, this is standard practice for package description files.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' functions to configure package metadata and installation parameters. It reads a long description from 'README.md' but does not process or execute untrusted data. The package metadata includes name, version, classifiers, and entry points for CLI scripts. There is no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network operations present. The setup script appears typical and benign, with no suspicious or malicious code behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or malware indicators are present.",
