  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'python_socket_test', defining package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, importing modules from setuptools",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks found; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "None explicitly identified; no input/output flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read 'README.md' without validation; no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup configuration using setuptools. It reads a README file to set the long description and defines a console script entry point. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No external data or untrusted inputs are processed at runtime. The setup script is straightforward and aligns with common Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup.py script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe, with no anomalous or suspicious behavior detected.",
