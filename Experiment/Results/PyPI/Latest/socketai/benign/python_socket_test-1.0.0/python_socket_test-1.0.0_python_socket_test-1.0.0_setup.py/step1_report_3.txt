  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'python_socket_test', including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; importing modules from setuptools to define setup parameters",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data processing or external data transmission present",
  "flows": "Reading README.md to include as long_description, then passing parameters to setup() to package the code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward setup script without dynamic code execution or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools modules to configure packaging, reads a local README.md for description, and sets up entry points for command-line scripts. There are no indications of malicious code such as network activity, code injection, or data leakage. The code appears to be a standard Python packaging script with no suspicious elements or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script for a Python package with no malicious behavior detected. It primarily manages package metadata and entry points, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
