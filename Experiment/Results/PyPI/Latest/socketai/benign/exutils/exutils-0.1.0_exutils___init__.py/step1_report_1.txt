  "purpose": "Export the catch_exception function for external use",
  "sources": "Import statement importing catch_exception from a local module catch_error",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None, as the code only performs an import and an export declaration",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function named catch_exception from a local module catch_error and exposes it via __all__ for module exports. There are no data flows, user inputs, or network operations present. The code appears to be a simple module setup, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module re-export with no malicious intent or security concerns identified. It is a standard pattern in Python module design.",
