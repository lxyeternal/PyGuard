  "purpose": "Export the catch_exception function from the catch_error module",
  "sources": "Import statement importing catch_exception from a relative module catch_error",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code only involves module exports",
  "flows": "No data flows; no untrusted data processing observed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; very minimal code, standard module export pattern",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function from a relative module and exposes it in __all__, indicating it is likely part of a package interface. No suspicious behavior, no input handling, no data processing, and no potentially malicious code or obfuscation. The simplicity of the code suggests it is a straightforward module export statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, benign module export with no malicious intent or security risks.",
