  "purpose": "Module re-export of catch_exception from catch_error",
  "sources": "Import from .catch_error module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data flows",
  "flows": "Import statement; no data flow to sinks",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export",
  "analysis": "The code imports catch_exception from a local module catch_error and exposes it via __all__. It contains no data flows, network operations, or untrusted data handling. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is minimal and standard for module re-exporting. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module re-export with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
