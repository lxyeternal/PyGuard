  "purpose": "Export the catch_exception function from the catch_error module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing catch_exception from a relative module catch_error.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or perform actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; only a simple import and export statement.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no signs of obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function catch_exception from a local module catch_error and declares it in __all__ for module export. No runtime data handling, network operations, or code execution occurs. The simplicity suggests a straightforward module interface without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal module export statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a standard, benign Python module interface definition.",
