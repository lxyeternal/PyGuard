  "purpose": "A decorator for catching exceptions in functions, printing detailed error info, and optionally suppressing exceptions with default return values.",
  "sources": "Function arguments, inspect.signature for parameter info, exception handling block.",
  "sinks": "Printing error messages, printing parameter info, traceback.print_exc().",
  "flows": "On exception, the decorator logs details about the function call and its arguments, then either suppresses or re-raises the exception.",
  "anomalies": "The code only logs information; it does not perform any malicious actions like data exfiltration or system manipulation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Usage of pandas is optional and only for argument inspection.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator to wrap functions, capturing exceptions, printing stack traces, and logging function parameters with handling for pandas objects, strings, dicts, sequences, and iterables. It is designed for debugging and error handling, not for malicious activities. No suspicious data flows, external connections, or malicious behavior observed. The presence of detailed parameter logging could be misused to leak sensitive info if misapplied, but this is not inherently malicious. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and serves debugging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a debugging utility with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behaviors. It solely logs exception details and parameters for troubleshooting. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
