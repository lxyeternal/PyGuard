{
  "purpose": "This code provides a decorator to catch and log exceptions in functions, with options to suppress exceptions and display detailed stack traces.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to decorated functions, including positional arguments (*args) and keyword arguments (**kwargs), which may contain user input, data structures, or other untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "Console print statements for exception messages, parameter details, and stack traces. No data is written to external systems or files. No network or system commands are executed.",
  "flows": "Function execution → Exception occurs → Decorator logs exception details and parameters → Depending on suppress/show flags, either returns default value or re-raises exception.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes verbose parameter inspection and detailed logging, but no suspicious hardcoded credentials, malicious commands, or obfuscation. No external network or system access is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator that catches exceptions in wrapped functions. It inspects function signatures and logs parameter values, including DataFrames, Series, strings, dicts, and iterables, with previews for debugging. Exception handling is limited to printing error info and optionally suppressing errors by returning a default value. No code injection, malicious data handling, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of pandas is optional and confined to parameter inspection. The overall behavior is for debugging and error handling, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a debugging utility designed to enhance error visibility during development. It does not perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or harmful system modifications. Its operations are limited to logging exception details and parameter previews for troubleshooting purposes.",
