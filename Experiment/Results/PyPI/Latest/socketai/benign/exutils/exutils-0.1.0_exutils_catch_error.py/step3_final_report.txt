{
  "purpose": "A decorator that catches exceptions in functions, logs detailed parameter info including pandas DataFrames/Series, strings, dicts, sequences, and iterables upon exception, and optionally suppresses or re-raises the exception.",
  "sources": "Function arguments captured via inspect.signature and bind, including pandas DataFrames/Series, strings, dicts, sequences, and iterables.",
  "sinks": "Logging output to stdout, printing exception traceback, and parameter previews; no external network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Function execution → exception occurs → decorator logs exception message, function parameters, and traceback → returns default value or re-raises based on flags.",
  "anomalies": "Potential privacy concern due to detailed logging of parameters, especially large pandas objects or sensitive data, but no malicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a transparent, well-structured debugging decorator that captures exceptions, logs detailed function parameters with previews, and handles pandas objects if pandas is installed. It uses inspect.signature and bind to accurately retrieve argument values. No external network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected. The main security consideration is the potential leakage of sensitive data through verbose logs, which is acknowledged and typical for debugging utilities. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately around 0.1-0.2 due to logging behavior. The logic is sound, with proper error handling during argument inspection. Overall, the code is benign, serving as a debugging utility, with minimal security concerns related to data privacy in logs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured debugging decorator that captures exceptions, logs detailed parameters, and optionally suppresses errors. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is potential privacy leakage from verbose logging, which is acceptable in debugging contexts. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
