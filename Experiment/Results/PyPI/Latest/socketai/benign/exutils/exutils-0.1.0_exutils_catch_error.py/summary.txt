  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured debugging decorator that captures exceptions, logs detailed parameters, and optionally suppresses errors. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is potential privacy leakage from verbose logging, which is acceptable in debugging contexts. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior."
