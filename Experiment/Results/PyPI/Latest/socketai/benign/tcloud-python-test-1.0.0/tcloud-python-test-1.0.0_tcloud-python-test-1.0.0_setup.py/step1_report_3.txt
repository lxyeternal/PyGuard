  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'tcloud-python-test', used to install dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.rst' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.rst' content and passes dependencies to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior. The import of 'tencentcloud' is straightforward and does not execute code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools. It imports the 'tencentcloud' module but does not invoke any functions from it, which is typical for setup scripts. The dependencies and package metadata are explicitly defined. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated code are present. The imported module 'tencentcloud' is not used in any malicious or suspicious way within this script. The reading of 'README.rst' is a common practice for long descriptions. No external input or network activity occurs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup.py file for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks based on the provided content.",
