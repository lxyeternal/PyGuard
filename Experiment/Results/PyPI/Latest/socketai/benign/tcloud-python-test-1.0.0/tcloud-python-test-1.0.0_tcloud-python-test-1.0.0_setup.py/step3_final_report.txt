  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'tcloud-python-test' project.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' for long_description; imports 'tencentcloud' package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or network activity; no data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; import is unused.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'tencentcloud'; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration with no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The import of 'tencentcloud' is unused and benign in this context. No evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities is present. The import could be a dependency inclusion, but without active code execution, it does not pose a threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the unused import of 'tencentcloud', which does not constitute malicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal.",
