  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network connections, file operations, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic code execution, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into data handling or network functions; obfuscated code may hide malicious payloads; potential data exfiltration or command execution could occur at sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated segments, unusual variable naming, dynamic code patterns, lack of comments, suspicious network or file activity, hardcoded secrets or credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code review indicates most dependencies are benign, performing standard data handling or server setup. Report 4 highlights signs of obfuscation and potential hidden behaviors, with moderate suspicion. The other reports show no malicious patterns, with high confidence in benign assessment. The suspicion in Report 4 warrants cautious scoring, with potential for increased malware and obfuscation scores if further evidence emerges. Overall, the code appears low risk but warrants attention to obfuscated segments.",
  "conclusion": "Most dependencies are safe; however, the obfuscated code in Report 4 suggests possible hidden malicious intent. The overall malware score should be kept low but slightly increased to reflect suspicion. Security risk remains low but should be monitored if further analysis confirms malicious patterns.",
