  "purpose": "The code sets the version number for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment to __version__ variable",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code simply assigns a string to a variable",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only a version string is present, no unusual or suspicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, a common practice in Python packages. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no sinks or data flows. The code is straightforward, minimal, and typical of package version declarations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serves the purpose of version tracking, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
