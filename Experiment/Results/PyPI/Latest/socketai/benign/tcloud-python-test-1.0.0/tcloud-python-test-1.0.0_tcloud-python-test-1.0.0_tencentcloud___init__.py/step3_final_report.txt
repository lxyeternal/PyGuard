  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the __version__ variable for package metadata.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment of a string value.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or output operations.",
  "flows": "None; the code is a simple assignment statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. There are no input sources, data flows, or external interactions. The code lacks any suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. It is minimal, clear, and serves a metadata purpose. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. No logical errors or security concerns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports correctly identify it as safe, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
