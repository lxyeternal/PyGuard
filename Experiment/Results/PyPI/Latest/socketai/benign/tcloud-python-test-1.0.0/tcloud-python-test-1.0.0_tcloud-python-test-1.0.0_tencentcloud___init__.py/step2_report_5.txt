  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is simply assigning a version string to `__version__`. There are no input sources, data flows, sinks, or any other suspicious activity. The code is minimal and standard for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. No logical errors or flaws are apparent in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code.  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious intent or behavior.  \n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Malicious or Vulnerable Claims**:  \n   The reports do not make any unwarranted assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and justified given the code's simplicity.\n\n**Overall assessment**:  \n- The code snippet is purely a version string assignment, a common and benign pattern.  \n- There is no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.  \n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThis code is entirely benign, standard practice for version declaration, and poses no security threat. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
