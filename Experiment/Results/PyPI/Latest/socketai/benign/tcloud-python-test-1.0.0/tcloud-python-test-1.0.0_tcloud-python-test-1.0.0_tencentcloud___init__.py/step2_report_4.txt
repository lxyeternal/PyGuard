  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code presence and correctness:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable. The code snippets are minimal, straightforward, and serve the common purpose of version tracking in Python packages. There are no signs of additional code, input handling, or data processing.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `malware`: 0  \n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   - `obfuscated`: 0  \n   \n   These are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code. The high confidence scores (mostly 1) are justified.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely a version string assignment with no external interactions, no data flow, and no suspicious constructs, there is no basis for any elevated risk scores. The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code. There is no indication of malicious intent, payloads, or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   No claims in the reports rely on assumptions; they are based on code analysis, confirming the benign nature.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate and well-founded.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the provided scores. The code is entirely benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis.",
