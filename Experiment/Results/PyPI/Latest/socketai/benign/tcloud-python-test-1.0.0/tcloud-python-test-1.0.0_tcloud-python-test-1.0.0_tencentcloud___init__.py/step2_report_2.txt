  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable. There are no input sources, data flows, sinks, or external interactions. The code is minimal, standard, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, serves only as metadata, and shows no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0. These are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code. The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is just a straightforward version string assignment with no external inputs, no data flows, and no suspicious behavior, increasing the risk score would be unjustified. The code poses no security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**  \n   The malware score is correctly set to 0 in all reports, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   No reports make unwarranted assumptions; they all correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code snippet is entirely benign, serving only as a version identifier. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.**",
