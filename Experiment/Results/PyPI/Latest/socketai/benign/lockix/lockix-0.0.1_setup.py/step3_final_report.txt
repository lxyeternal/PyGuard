{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description, importing setuptools, calling find_packages().",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "Reading local file 'README.md' into long_description; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is static, straightforward, and follows common packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script that uses setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and description. It reads a local file 'README.md' for the long description, which is standard. There are no dynamic code executions, network activities, or handling of untrusted input. The code structure is simple and clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic. All dependencies are legitimate, and the overall purpose is to prepare the package for distribution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are accurate and appropriate given the code's nature.",
