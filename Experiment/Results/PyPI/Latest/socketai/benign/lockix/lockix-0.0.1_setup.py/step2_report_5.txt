  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project.\n- The code reads 'README.md' to set the long description, which is a common practice.\n- No report mentions any dynamic code execution, untrusted input handling, or external data processing beyond reading a local file.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious behavior detected.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, aligning with the assessment that the code is benign.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The only potential concern raised is reading 'README.md' directly. While this is standard, if the file contains malicious code, it could pose a risk. However, in typical package setup scripts, this is common and generally safe.\n- No suspicious logic, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The code does not perform any network activity, code injection, or data handling from untrusted sources.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware = 0, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated = 0 is correct.\n- Security risk = 0 aligns with the analysis.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all reports, which seems justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard setup.py script with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores are reasonable.\n- The only minor note is the reading of 'README.md', but this is a common practice and not inherently risky.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided information.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe setup script is benign, standard, and safe. The scores reflect this accurately.",
