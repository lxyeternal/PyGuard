  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'lockix' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Read operations on 'README.md' for long description, and package metadata such as name, version, author info, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to potential vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "No significant data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations. The only file read ('README.md') is a static file used for documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present. The code uses standard setup patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a local README.md file for the long description, specifies package requirements and metadata. All operations are standard and do not involve untrusted data processing or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It is safe to use.",
