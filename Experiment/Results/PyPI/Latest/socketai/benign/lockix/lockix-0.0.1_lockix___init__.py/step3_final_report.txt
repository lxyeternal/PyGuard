{
  "purpose": "Assign a benign security assessment to a trivial Python code snippet that assigns a static string to a variable.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, environment variables, or data sources; static code with a direct assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple assignment with no data propagation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious constructs, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single line assigning 'hehe' to variable 'a'. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, and confidence is high (1.0). There are no anomalies or suspicious behaviors. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is completely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or escalation is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
  "malware": 0.0,
  "securityRisk": 0.0,
