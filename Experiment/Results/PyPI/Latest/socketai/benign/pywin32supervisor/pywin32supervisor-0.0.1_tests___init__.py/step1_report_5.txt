{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python module or script that initializes certain variables and functions, potentially for data processing or system interaction, but lacks explicit documentation or comments indicating a clear purpose.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from variables, possibly environment variables or function parameters. No explicit input sources like user prompts, file reads, or network requests are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements, variable assignments, or function calls that could be used to execute commands or handle data insecurely. No direct output or data exfiltration points are immediately apparent.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., variables or environment variables) through functions or processing steps to sinks such as output statements or external calls. No explicit flow paths are clearly defined due to the minimal code provided.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are evident. The code structure is straightforward with no unusual language features or dynamic execution techniques. However, lack of comments or documentation is a minor concern.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet lacks clear input handling or output mechanisms. It initializes variables and functions in a typical manner without evident malicious intent. There are no signs of data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors. The absence of comments and minimal logic suggests the code is either incomplete or simple. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected within the given fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with no malicious or suspicious features identified. Confidence in this assessment is high given the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
