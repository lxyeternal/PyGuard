  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard unit tests for process management, using mocks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious outputs; process control is local.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets, or malicious patterns. Uses mocks, no real external interaction.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malware or security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a standard test suite with no malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus on process management, extensive mocking.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of data exfiltration or malicious network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or backdoors; standard testing practices.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature. Malware score of 0 and securityRisk of 0.1 are reasonable, given the minimal residual risk from process management code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on process start/stop with mocks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard testing code.\n\n**Assessment:** The malware score remains at 0, and securityRisk at 0.2 is acceptable, considering the code's controlled environment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Testing process control functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or malicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or payloads.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Assessment:** Malware: 0, securityRisk: 0.2 seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Testing process management, mocks, process termination.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, backdoors, or code injection.\n- **Conclusion:** Clearly benign.\n\n**Assessment:** Malware: 0, securityRisk: 0 are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, payloads, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Scores:** Very low, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a comprehensive unit test suite for process management, heavily relying on mocks.\n- No external data, network activity, or secrets are involved.\n- No suspicious patterns, code injection, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The process control logic is standard and safe within a test environment.\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, readable code.\n- **Risk:** **0** — No security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign testing code with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
