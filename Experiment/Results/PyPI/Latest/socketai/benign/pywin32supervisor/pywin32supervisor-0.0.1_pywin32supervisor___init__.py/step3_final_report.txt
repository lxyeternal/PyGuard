{
  "purpose": "The code performs data processing and utility functions with standard libraries, involving environment variables and subprocess calls, but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, processes data, executes subprocesses, and handles files.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable to data leaks or command injection if inputs are untrusted, especially via subprocess and environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, files) flow into subprocess calls and data processing functions, which could lead to data leaks or command execution if inputs are malicious.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of subprocess and environment variables is typical but warrants caution.",
  "analysis": "The code appears standard with no signs of malicious payloads or obfuscation. The use of environment variables and subprocesses is common but can be risky if inputs are untrusted. No suspicious external connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The risk stems from potential misuse rather than active malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is moderate (~0.2-0.3) due to typical concerns about subprocess and environment variable handling. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.8), given the lack of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious activity detected. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating low malware and obfuscation scores, and a moderate risk due to common security considerations. No immediate threats are present, but standard precautions regarding subprocess and environment variable handling should be maintained.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
