  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform data processing or computation, but the specific intent cannot be determined definitively without detailed context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function arguments, and possibly external modules or files.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to files, network connections, or logs; it also uses subprocesses which could execute commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables, function parameters) through processing functions, potentially reaching output or external command execution points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. The code structure appears standard, with no unusual language features or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to perform routine data manipulation or computation tasks using standard Python libraries. No evidence of malicious intent such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized access is present. It uses environment variables and subprocesses, which are common in many legitimate scripts. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns like obfuscated code, embedded payloads, or unusual data flows. Overall, the code's behavior aligns with typical, benign usage.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility or processing script with no evident malicious intent or malicious payloads. The risk level is low, and there are no concerning anomalies identified.",
