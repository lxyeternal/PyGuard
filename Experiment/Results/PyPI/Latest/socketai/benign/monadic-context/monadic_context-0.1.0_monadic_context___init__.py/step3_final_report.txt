  "purpose": "The code performs routine data processing, environment variable reading, or network/file I/O without evidence of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, input functions, command-line arguments, or data from files or network sources.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to files, network connections, or system outputs; no suspicious external connections identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input functions to outputs or processing functions without suspicious manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, with standard data handling and processing routines. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. Confidence is high that the code is benign, with no malicious indicators or suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code summaries, the dependency shows no malicious activity or security risks. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low security risk score of 0.2 reflecting cautious conservatism. Overall, the dependency is considered safe.",
