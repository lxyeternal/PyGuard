{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for composing and piping callable functions in Python, enabling functional programming patterns.",
  "sources": "Input data can come from function arguments to 'pipe' or 'compose' functions, and from the 'source' argument in the '_compose' inner function.",
  "sinks": "Function outputs are returned directly by 'pipe' and 'compose'; no direct sinks for untrusted data are evident. There are no explicit data leaks or insecure data handling shown.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments of 'pipe' or 'compose', through a series of callable functions, to the return value. No external or untrusted data sources are explicitly read within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive type annotations and overloads, but no suspicious or malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code is straightforward utility code for function composition.",
  "analysis": "The code implements 'compose' and 'pipe' functions for functional composition of callables, using 'reduce' for 'compose'. It uses multiple overloads for static type hints. No dynamic code execution, input reading from external sources, or other malicious behaviors are observed. The license header is standard, and no embedded or hidden code is evident. Overall, this appears to be benign utility code without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility module for function composition and piping in Python. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities. It appears safe for use and does not contain obfuscation or malware.",
