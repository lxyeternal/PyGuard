{
  "purpose": "The code defines functional programming utilities for composing and piping functions, allowing for cleaner and more readable function chaining.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs or environment variables are read; only function parameters are used internally.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication are present; functions simply process data passed to them.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through user-supplied functions via compose() and pipe() utilities; no external data flow or network interaction occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code uses standard Python constructs and well-documented type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code provides overloads for type hinting, but the core logic is in the compose() function, which reduces multiple functions into a single function using reduce. The pipe() function applies functions sequentially to a value. No external data sources, sinks, or suspicious code patterns are identified. All functions perform standard functional programming operations, with no signs of malicious intent or unusual behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a utility module for function composition and piping, implemented with standard Python features. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible, and the code appears to be safe and benign.",
