{
  "purpose": "The code defines functional programming utilities for composing and piping functions, enabling functional chaining of callables.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; no user input or environment variables accessed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not perform data output, network communication, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code simply composes functions and applies them to data, with no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. Use of type annotations and overloads is standard and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for composing multiple callables into a single function ('compose') and applying functions in sequence to a value ('pipe'). It includes multiple overloads for type hinting but no dynamic or reflective code execution, no network, and no data leaks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The license and comments are standard, indicating open-source distribution. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and appears to serve as a utility library for functional programming.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for function composition and piping, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
