{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for composing and piping functions in a functional programming style.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (__op1, __op2, etc.) and the 'source' argument in the '_compose' and 'pipe' functions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not read from or write to external sources, files, or network.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through the composed functions in 'compose' or through the chained functions in 'pipe', with no external data sinks or leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, uses standard Python features, and contains no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines overloaded function signatures for 'compose' and 'pipe' to enable static type checking, then implements 'compose' using 'reduce' to chain functions left to right, and 'pipe' to apply functions sequentially to a value. The implementation is standard, with no dynamic code execution, external data access, or obfuscation. The code is a benign utility module for functional composition, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for function composition and piping, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores should be set to malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 for maximum accuracy.",
