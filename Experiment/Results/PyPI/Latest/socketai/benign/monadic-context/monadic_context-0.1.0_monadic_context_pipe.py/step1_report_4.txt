{
  "purpose": "The code provides functional programming utilities 'compose' and 'pipe' for composing and applying functions in a left-to-right manner.",
  "sources": "The code reads only from imported modules, function parameters, and local variables. No external data sources or input mechanisms are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code that process untrusted data or lead to security vulnerabilities such as data leaks, code execution, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "The functions 'compose' and 'pipe' take functions and data as input, process data through function composition, and return results. No external or untrusted data flow to critical sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of functional composition and piping utilities, with no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated features. No suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines overloads for 'compose' and 'pipe' functions to support multiple function compositions with type hints. The implementation uses 'reduce' to apply functions in sequence, which is standard. No external data inputs, no eval, no dynamic code execution, and no network or system operations are present. The code is purely functional and does not contain any hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Overall, it is a benign utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign utility library for function composition and piping with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain security risks, or vulnerabilities. It simply provides functional composition features without external dependencies that could be exploited.",
