{
  "purpose": "The code defines utility functions 'compose' and 'pipe' for functional composition and data flow control, primarily for use in functional programming styles.",
  "sources": "No explicit external data sources or input reads are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present; the functions operate on passed-in callables and data without side effects.",
  "flows": "The functions create a composition pipeline where data flows through a sequence of callables, but there are no external or malicious data flows; the data flow is controlled within the function parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hard-coded secrets, or unusual code behavior are detected. The code primarily consists of standard functional programming constructs with proper use of Python features and annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements 'compose' and 'pipe' functions that facilitate functional composition of callables. It uses 'reduce' to chain functions, which is a common pattern. The use of Python typing overloads helps with type hints. No external input, no environment variables, no network operations, nor any suspicious or malicious code segments are present. The functions are purely utility functions without side effects. The license and comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or hidden code is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of functional composition utilities, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware or security threats.",
