  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Summary of all reports:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a utility library for function composition ('compose') and piping ('pipe').\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data leaks are identified.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code patterns are present.\n- Use of standard Python features, type annotations, and overloads.\n- The code is purely functional, with no network, file, or environment interactions.\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores are negligible (mostly 0 or 0.1).\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's security and behavior:\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of function composition utilities.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- No dynamic code execution, eval, or reflective code.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n- The type overloads are standard for static type hinting and do not introduce security concerns.\n- The core logic (using `reduce`) is a common pattern and safe.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1, which is acceptable given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is a utility for functional composition with no external interactions or suspicious patterns, the risk scores are appropriately low.\n- The minimal 0.1 in one report likely accounts for the complexity or overloads, but it does not indicate actual risk.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is safe, benign, and free of malware or obfuscation.\n- The scores across reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- No need to adjust scores.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (completely benign utility code)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, well-implemented utility for function composition and piping, with no security risks or malicious intent. The reported scores are accurate, and I agree with their assessments.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe and benign.",
