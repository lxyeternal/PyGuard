  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets. The use of `_unsafe_map` is noted but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is a dependency injection framework with no signs of malicious activity. The low security risk score is appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious behavior, standard patterns, no external system interactions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The use of internal counters for tags is benign, and no malicious flows are identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, a dependency injection system with no malicious activity. No network or system modifications.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the code's nature. The minimal security risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports; no malicious behavior, no external operations.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent and thorough.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no malicious activity, standard dependency injection pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower risk score (0.1) is reasonable given the absence of any suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, assigning a malware score of 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's nature—dependency injection, context management, generator-based dependency resolution—there are no evident vulnerabilities or malicious flows. The minor risk scores (0.1 to 0.2) are reasonable, reflecting potential concern over `_unsafe_map` if sensitive data is stored, but no actual vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Adjustments to scores:**  \n  The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports or the code justify a risk score higher than 0.2, given the absence of malicious behavior, external system interactions, or hardcoded secrets.\n\n- **Malware and obfuscation scores:**  \n  Correctly assigned as 0 across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (low, due to potential mishandling of `_unsafe_map` but no actual vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a standard, well-structured dependency injection and context management library with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The current scoring aligns well with the detailed reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, with minimal security concerns. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
