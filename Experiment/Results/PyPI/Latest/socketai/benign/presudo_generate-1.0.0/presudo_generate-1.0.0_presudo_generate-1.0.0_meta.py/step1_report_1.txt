  "purpose": "Dynamically loads and executes code from a zip archive, possibly for modular or plugin-based functionality.",
  "sources": "Reading built-in functions (__import__), reading the zip file ('zip.zip') using zipimporter.",
  "sinks": "Executing module code via exec_module, calling module.hello().",
  "flows": "__import__ of 'importlib' and 'zipimport' → creation of zipimporter → loading and executing 'zip.zip' → calling 'hello' method.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual dynamic manipulation of __builtins__, indirect import of 'importlib' and 'zipimport' via __import__, overwriting __init__ method of a metaclass with 'test', which performs dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by manipulating the __builtins__ object in an unusual way, extracting and overwriting built-ins with a custom list, which could obscure the behavior. It then dynamically imports 'importlib' and 'zipimport' modules via the __import__ method, which itself is stored in a variable, indicating obfuscation. The 'test' function loads a zip archive ('zip.zip') using zipimporter, creates a module from it using importlib utilities, and then executes the module. The 'test' function is assigned to the __init__ method of a custom metaclass, which could be used to trigger the code execution during class creation or instantiation. This dynamic loading and execution of code from a zip archive, especially with the obfuscated import mechanism and replacing __init__ in a metaclass, is suspicious and potentially malicious, allowing arbitrary code execution from the zip archive.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed to load and execute code from an external zip archive dynamically, with obfuscation techniques that make static analysis difficult. It could be benign in some contexts, but the pattern of dynamic import, overwriting built-ins, and executing code from an archive raises suspicion of malicious intent, such as executing arbitrary code during module or class creation. Overall, it is risky and warrants caution.",
