  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and standard for a setup script. The only potential security concern is the external 'meta' module and sys.path modification, which could be exploited if malicious modules are present. No malicious code, obfuscation, or active security threats are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to the external dependency and environment modification."
