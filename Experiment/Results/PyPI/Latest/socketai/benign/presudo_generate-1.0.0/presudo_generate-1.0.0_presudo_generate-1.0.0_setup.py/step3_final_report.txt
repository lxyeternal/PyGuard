{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'presudo-generate', configuring package metadata, including resource files, and customizing installation behavior via a custom class with a metaclass.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; imports 'meta' module from parent directory; uses 'sys.path' modification to include parent directory; defines a custom install class 'CoInstall' inheriting from setuptools' 'install'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or code execution; potential concern in importing 'meta' from an external location and modifying 'sys.path'.",
  "flows": "Imports 'meta' from parent directory (source), which could be executed or tampered with; no other data flows or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "Importing 'meta' from parent directory; modifying 'sys.path' to include parent directory; defining a custom install class with a metaclass; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with minimal logic, primarily configuration. The import of 'meta' from a parent directory and sys.path modification are unusual and could be exploited if malicious modules are present, but no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation exists. The custom class and setup parameters are typical. The overall structure is benign, with the main concern being external dependencies and environment modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and standard for a setup script. The only potential security concern is the external 'meta' module and sys.path modification, which could be exploited if malicious modules are present. No malicious code, obfuscation, or active security threats are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to the external dependency and environment modification.",
