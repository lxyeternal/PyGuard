  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, importing 'meta' module, accessing package data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted input; setup-related functions generally do not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "File read operation, import of 'meta', execution of 'setup' with package data and custom command class.",
  "anomalies": "Importing a 'meta' module from a parent directory could potentially be suspicious if 'meta' contains malicious code. The class 'CoInstall' inherits from 'install' with a custom metaclass, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors are present. No network activity or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file, defines a custom install command class 'CoInstall' that inherits from 'install' and uses a custom metaclass 'Metaclass'. The 'meta' module is imported from a parent directory, which warrants caution if 'meta' is malicious; however, based solely on this code, no malicious activity is evident. The setup parameters are typical, with no suspicious data or behaviors. The code structure is clear and straightforward without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with a minor unusual aspect of importing a 'meta' module from the parent directory. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are apparent from this code. It is a normal package setup with no suspicious features.",
