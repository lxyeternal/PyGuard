{
  "purpose": "The code reads environment variables, processes data, and interacts with system resources without evidence of malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, imported modules, input functions, network or file I/O (if present).",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic execution functions like eval or exec.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., environment variables, user input) passing through processing functions to sinks such as network or file operations, potentially via dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic functions like eval or exec, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, or obfuscated code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns or malicious indicators. Dynamic features are used but deemed safe in context. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscation detected. Confidence is high (0.9). The code's behavior aligns with low security risk. No malicious activity or backdoors are evident. The overall structure and signals do not suggest sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is considered safe, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is negligible. Slight caution is maintained due to dynamic features, but current evidence supports a benign assessment.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
