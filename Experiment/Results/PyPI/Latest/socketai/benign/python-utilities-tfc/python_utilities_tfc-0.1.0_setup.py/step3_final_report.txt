  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata and dependencies for a Python project related to Terraform Cloud utilities.",
  "sources": "Static strings in setup() parameters such as name, version, description, author, author_email, packages, install_requires, and python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and standard for setup.py.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, external data fetching, or user input. It does not process untrusted data, execute commands, or perform network operations. The code structure is typical, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. All parameters are hardcoded, and dependencies are explicitly listed. The reports correctly identify the benign and standard nature of this script, assigning high confidence scores and zero malware/security risk scores. There are no anomalies or malicious indicators present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup.py script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The package is safe for use.",
