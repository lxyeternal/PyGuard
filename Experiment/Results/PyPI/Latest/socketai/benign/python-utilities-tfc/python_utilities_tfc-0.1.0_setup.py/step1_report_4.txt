  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'python_utilities_tfc' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, setup() function parameters (name, version, description, author, author_email, packages, install_requires, python_requires).",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data handling present; package installation parameters are static.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup parameters are hardcoded and static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be a standard setup script with no hidden or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the setup tools, then calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and requirements. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution present. The code is straightforward and adheres to common Python packaging practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The dependencies are standard, and all parameters are static.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
