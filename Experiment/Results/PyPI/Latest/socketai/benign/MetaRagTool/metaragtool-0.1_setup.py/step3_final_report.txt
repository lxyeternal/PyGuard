  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging the Python project 'MetaRagTool'.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources; static code defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in email domain ('yhaoo.com' instead of 'yahoo.com'); placeholder description; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No embedded scripts, obfuscated code, or external malicious calls are present. The only irregularity is a typo in the author's email domain, which is likely a benign mistake. The provided reports are empty, indicating no detected issues or vulnerabilities. Given the straightforward nature of the code and lack of suspicious elements, the risk and malware scores should be minimal. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws is observed in the code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The package appears benign with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities detected. The empty reports do not provide any contrary evidence. The only concern is a minor typo in the email address, which does not impact security. Overall, the code is safe, and the package can be considered low risk.",
