{
  "purpose": "Import core components of a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system, likely for NLP or AI applications.",
  "sources": "Import statement from current package modules: RAG, LLM, Utils, Evaluations, Encoders.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible as the code only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and only imports modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple modules from the current package namespace, which suggests modular design. The __version__ attribute is set to '0.1.0', indicating a package version. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code's simplicity reduces suspicion of malicious activity. Since it only contains import statements and a version assignment, there is no execution of untrusted data or potentially dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is benign, serving as an import hub for core components of a RAG system. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
