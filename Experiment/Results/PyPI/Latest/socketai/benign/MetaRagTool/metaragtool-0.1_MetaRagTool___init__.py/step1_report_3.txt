{
  "purpose": "This code imports core components related to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM, Utils, Evaluations, and Encoders, likely for a larger NLP or AI application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: RAG, LLM, Utils, Evaluations, Encoders",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data output operations detected",
  "flows": "N/A (only import statements, no runtime data flow)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded version string is typical for module versioning",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, indicating modular design. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors. The version string is standard practice for package versioning. No evidence of malicious intent or security risks is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initialization with no malicious activity or security concerns. It imports core components for a larger application, and no anomalies or security issues are detected.",
