  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe import statements from local modules related to a RAG system.\n- No external data input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution are mentioned.\n- The code snippets are straightforward, consisting solely of import statements and a version string.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are all zero or near zero, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and assessments:\n\n**Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code is minimal and only performs module imports. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are present in the logic or reasoning of the reports.\n- The code is standard for a package's `__init__.py` or main module, setting up core components.\n\n**Score evaluations:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores as 0 or 0.1, which seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (1.0), consistent with the straightforward analysis.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n- No assumptions are made about external data or runtime behaviors; the analysis correctly notes the lack of such behaviors.\n- No claims of malicious activity are unjustified.\n\n**Malware score justification:**\n- Since the code only imports internal modules and sets a version string, there's no malware risk.\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Obfuscated code:**\n- The code is not obfuscated; the scores of 0 are correct.\n\n**Security risk:**\n- No security risks are evident from the import statements alone.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature, I would maintain the current scores.\n- My own estimates align with the reports: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Code presence:** No issues; purely import statements.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate; no change needed.\n- **Risk justification:** Not applicable; scores are correctly low.\n- **Overall conclusion:** The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's nature.",
