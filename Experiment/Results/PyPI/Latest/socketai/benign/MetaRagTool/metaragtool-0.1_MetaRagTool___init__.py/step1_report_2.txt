{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define the core components of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, importing various modules related to RAG, language models, utilities, evaluations, and encoders.",
  "sources": "The only source of data reading is the import statement, which loads internal modules; no external input data is directly read.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not process or output data explicitly.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive sinks; the code solely imports internal modules without performing operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior; it only imports modules and sets a version.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several modules related to a RAG system, likely part of a larger project. There are no apparent data inputs, outputs, or processing. The import statements suggest modular design, with no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration or backdoors. The version string is benign and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module import statement for core components of a RAG system, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is a normal, benign module setup.",
