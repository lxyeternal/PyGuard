  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports and version setting",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules and a version string assignment. There are no data processing, input/output, or network operations. The imports are from relative modules, which are standard practice in package code. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module import and version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. It is a typical package component setup.",
