  "purpose": "Import core modules related to a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system and set version.",
  "sources": "Local import statements from modules: RAG, LLM, Utils, Evaluations, Encoders.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external input/output, network activity, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Import statements are static; no runtime data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard module imports with a version string.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules and a version string. There are no runtime data flows, no external inputs or outputs, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution. The code is clear, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the benign and minimal nature of the code. No suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities are present. The code appears to be part of a typical Python package initialization or core module setup, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with only import statements and a version string. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores and assessments in all reports are accurate and consistent with the code's simple structure.",
