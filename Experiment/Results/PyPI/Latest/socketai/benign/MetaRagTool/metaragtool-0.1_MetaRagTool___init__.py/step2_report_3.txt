  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements of local modules related to a RAG system.\n- No external data inputs, outputs, or runtime behaviors are mentioned.\n- The code contains only import statements and a version string.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activity are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. The code only contains import statements and a version string, matching the reports' descriptions.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports are consistent; they correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue?**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of scores and reasoning:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code only imports modules; no malicious code or behavior is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the lack of any security concerns.\n\n- **Confidence Level:**  \n  All reports have high confidence (1), which is justified given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the code only imports internal modules and sets a version, there's no reason to suspect malicious activity.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the reports correctly avoid speculative claims.\n- The consistency across reports is good, and the scores align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the code's benign, straightforward import pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. No modifications needed. The code is a standard module import snippet with no security issues.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the code's nature.",
