  "purpose": "Generate an HTML visualization and a Python script to process and save a 3D model based on an input filename and code content.",
  "sources": "Reads the filename argument from command line; reads code lines from the specified file.",
  "sinks": "Writes to output HTML and Python files; executes the generated Python script via os.system.",
  "flows": "Command line argument -> file reading -> string formatting for HTML and Python script -> execution of the Python script.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamically constructs and executes code from an external filename without validation. Uses os.system to run the generated script, which executes arbitrary code.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts a filename argument, extracts the base name, and reads its content. It creates an HTML file embedding the code and a model viewer, and a Python script that imports 'piecad', executes the read code, modifies the output, and saves a model. The script then runs this Python code using os.system. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are evident; however, executing external code via os.system introduces potential security risks if the input file is malicious or contains harmful code. The code's primary concern is the execution of untrusted code through dynamically generated and run scripts, which could be exploited to run malicious code if the input file is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain explicit malicious payloads but performs dynamic code execution based on external input, which could be exploited if the input is malicious. The main security concern is the use of os.system to run arbitrary code, potentially allowing code injection or execution of malicious scripts if the input file is compromised. Overall, moderate risk due to dynamic execution but no specific malware indicators found.",
