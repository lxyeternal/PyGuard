  "conclusion": "The script does not contain embedded malware but employs unsafe practices by executing untrusted code without validation, creating a high security risk. The main vulnerability lies in the dynamic code execution pattern, which could be exploited if the input file is malicious. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is approximately 0.75, reflecting high potential for exploitation."
