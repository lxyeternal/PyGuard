  "purpose": "The code appears to generate an HTML file that visualizes a 3D model and executes dynamically generated Python code to create and save 3D objects.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line argument (filename), reads file content (example_code), and constructs filenames for output files.",
  "sinks": "Writes HTML and Python files, executes the generated Python code via os.system.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument -> Read file content -> Generate HTML and Python scripts -> Execute Python script with os.system",
  "anomalies": "Dynamically executes code with os.system, constructs code from file input without validation, potential injection points via filename and file content, no validation or sanitization of inputs.",
  "analysis": "The script processes a filename argument, extracts a base name, reads the specified file content, and embeds it into an HTML template for visualization. It then generates a Python script that imports 'piecad', executes the file content as code, modifies 'out', and saves a model. This generated script is executed via os.system. The code does not sanitize input filenames or code content, allowing potential injection if malicious files or code are supplied. The direct execution of external code with os.system and unvalidated file content is a security risk. There are no hardcoded credentials, no malicious payloads explicitly evident, but the dynamic code execution and input handling are risky.",
  "conclusion": "The code facilitates dynamic code execution based on external input without validation, posing a significant security risk. It could be exploited for code injection if malicious files are processed. While there is no explicit malicious payload present, the structure allows for potential malicious use through crafted inputs.",
