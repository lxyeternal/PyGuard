{
  "purpose": "The code loads a font, extracts glyphs, converts them to polygons, and generates 3D objects for visualization or further processing.",
  "sources": "Reads font files from local filesystem or package resources; reads input string `tstr` in `_text_func`.",
  "sinks": "Writes 3D model data to a file (/tmp/text.obj). No untrusted data processing or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Font file path is determined from input `fname` or resource; glyphs are processed into polygons; polygons are scaled and combined; final 3D object is saved to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secret keys. No evidence of malicious code such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to perform font processing and 3D model generation without external or malicious interactions.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles font file loading, glyph extraction, polygon generation, and 3D object creation. It uses standard font processing libraries without obfuscation or dynamic code execution. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious operations are present. The code does not appear to perform any malicious actions; it functions as a font-to-3D model converter.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing font processing and 3D object creation. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks were identified.",
