{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate 3D text geometries from font files, convert glyphs into polygons, and save the resulting 3D object to a file.",
  "sources": "Reads font files from resources or filesystem; reads string input for text rendering.",
  "sinks": "Writes 3D object data to a file ('/tmp/text.obj').",
  "flows": "Font file loading → glyph extraction and polygon creation → text layout and transformation → 3D object generation → file saving.",
  "anomalies": "Uses local resource files for font loading; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no network activity or code that manipulates system files beyond writing an OBJ file; no obfuscated code; no suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code loads font files from either resource directory or filesystem, processes glyphs into polygonal shapes, scales and positions them for text rendering, and finally creates and saves a 3D object file. All operations are related to font processing and 3D modeling. No signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors are present. The code relies on standard font processing libraries and only performs expected operations without hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a font-to-3D geometry generator with no malicious behavior detected. It handles font resources securely and performs legitimate processing tasks. No malware, backdoors, or security risks identified.",
