{
  "purpose": "The code loads a font file, extracts glyph outlines, and renders text as 3D objects for visualization or further processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads a font file specified by a filename, either from a resource directory or an absolute/relative path.",
  "sinks": "The code writes a 3D model to a file ('/tmp/text.obj').",
  "flows": "Font file is loaded in '_set_font', glyphs are processed in '_get_glyph_polygon', and the final 3D object is saved to disk via 'save'.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'impresources.files' to locate font files, which is standard; no hardcoded credentials, network connections, or suspicious data flows observed. The 'print' statement for unhandled items is benign for a script, not malicious. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads font files, processes glyphs for rendering text as 3D objects, and saves the output. It uses standard libraries and functions, with no evidence of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious payloads. The only potential concern is the ability to load arbitrary font files via filename input, which could be misused if untrusted input is provided externally, but this is a typical pattern for font rendering tools. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate font processing and 3D rendering tasks without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It securely loads font files, processes glyphs, and saves the output. There is no indication of malware or security risks.",
