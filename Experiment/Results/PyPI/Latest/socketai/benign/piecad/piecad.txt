      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The script does not contain embedded malware but employs unsafe practices by executing untrusted code without validation, creating a high security risk. The main vulnerability lies in the dynamic code execution pattern, which could be exploited if the input file is malicious. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is approximately 0.75, reflecting high potential for exploitation."

The low security risk score is justified, assuming the external library '_m' is trustworthy. Minor logical correction regarding empty input handling is recommended but does not impact security."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source implementation of a segment and polygon intersection detection algorithm. No malicious or sabotage features are evident. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) due to debug flags. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy."

The overall security risk is very low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low risk score (~0.2) due to coding oversights. It is safe for use in open-source projects, with standard review and minor cleanup recommended."

The only minor security consideration involves filename handling during diagnostics export, which is a common feature and not inherently malicious. Overall, there is no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation."
