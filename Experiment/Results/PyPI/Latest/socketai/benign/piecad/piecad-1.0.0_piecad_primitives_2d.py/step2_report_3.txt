  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential security issues, code behavior, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code creates 2D shapes and includes dynamic import of a `_text` module for text rendering. No malicious code or obfuscation is evident. The main concern is the dynamic import, which could be a vector if the module is compromised.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The dynamic import is standard but warrants caution. No signs of malware or malicious intent are present.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the dynamic import of the font module and no malicious behavior detected. The code is standard for shape creation and text rendering.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0\n\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the dynamic import as a potential vector but concludes the overall risk is low.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on shape creation and font management via dynamic import. No network activity or malicious code is evident. The use of dynamic import is controlled and typical for font modules.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. The dynamic import is standard and does not suggest malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar analysis, emphasizing that the code is a utility for shape and text rendering with no malicious behavior. The dynamic import is standard for modular font handling.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0\n\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion that the risk is minimal is valid. The dynamic import is the only unusual aspect but not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is for shape creation and font rendering, with controlled dynamic import. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1, Obfuscated: 0\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower risk score reflects the controlled nature of the dynamic import and absence of other risks.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; no obfuscation or hidden code is present.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The risk is primarily due to dynamic module import for font handling. The scores range from 0.1 to 0.2, which seems reasonable given the controlled nature of the import and the lack of other vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The dynamic import of the `_text` module is the only noteworthy point. While it is standard practice, it should be used with validated modules and secure environments.\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with the code's behavior and potential risks.\n\n- Given the low risk and absence of malicious indicators, I would assign the following **my estimates**:\n\n  - **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malware)\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code structure)\n  - **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, controlled dynamic import)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and cautious. The code appears safe, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main consideration is ensuring the environment hosting the `_text` module is secure, but that is outside the scope of this code review.\n\n**Final verdict:** No significant security concerns detected. The current scores are appropriate.",
