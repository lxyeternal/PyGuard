{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to create 2D geometric shapes (circles, ellipses, polygons, rectangles, squares, stars) and manages text rendering via dynamic module import, primarily for font handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters for shape dimensions, segments, radii, and configuration data; dynamically imports '_text' module for font functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses external '_m' library for shape construction; dynamic import of '_text' module which could execute arbitrary code if compromised.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into shape creation functions; dynamic import of '_text' module occurs during font setting and text rendering functions; no network or system modification observed.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual dynamic import pattern for font module; commented-out arc code; no obfuscation or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility library for creating 2D shapes with input validation and caching. The dynamic import of '_text' is a common pattern for modular font management but could be exploited if the module is malicious. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The functions perform expected operations with no hidden behaviors. The overall structure is clean and typical for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign shape creation and text rendering utility with a controlled dynamic import pattern. No signs of malware, malicious intent, or obfuscation are detected. The primary concern is ensuring the integrity of the '_text' module in deployment, but the code itself is safe.",
