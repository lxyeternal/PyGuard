  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes functions creating 2D shapes, reading parameters, and configuration data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses external library `_m`, dynamic import of `_text` module for text functions, which could execute arbitrary code if compromised.\n- **Anomalies:** Unusual dynamic import pattern, but no malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears standard for geometric shape creation with a controlled dynamic import for text rendering. No signs of malware or malicious behavior. The main concern is the `_text` module's integrity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the dynamic import of the font module for text rendering.\n- No network or system modification activities.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same as above; low risk, primarily due to dynamic import, which is typical but warrants control.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on shape creation and dynamic font module import.\n- No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a utility library with minimal risk, mainly associated with the dynamic import pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar assessment; shape creation, font management via dynamic import.\n- No network activity or malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, with a note on controlled dynamic import.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern: shape functions, font management via dynamic import.\n- No malicious signs or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Low security risk, typical for such utilities.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.1, Obfuscated=0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports indicate that the code is primarily a geometric shape creation library with text rendering support via dynamic module import.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The dynamic import is standard for modular font handling.\n- **Potential Risks:** The only notable concern is the dynamic import of the `_text` module, which could be a vector if the module or font files are compromised. However, in a controlled environment, this pattern is common and generally safe.\n- **Functionality & Logic:** The functions are straightforward, with proper validation and caching, no hidden or suspicious logic.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** Given the reliance on external modules and dynamic import, a conservative estimate would be around 0.2, acknowledging the potential for risk if the modules are compromised, but no evidence of actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.2**\n\nThis aligns with the overall low threat level indicated by the reports, considering the controlled use of dynamic imports and standard shape creation functions.",
