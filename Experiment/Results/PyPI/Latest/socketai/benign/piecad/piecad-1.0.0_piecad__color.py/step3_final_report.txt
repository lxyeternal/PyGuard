  "purpose": "A utility for parsing and validating CSS color specifications provided as color names, hex strings, or RGB tuples.",
  "sources": "Input color specification string or tuple passed to _parse_color function.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows to external systems or sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into _parse_color, which validates and converts it to RGB tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static color dictionary, straightforward validation, no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static validation of color inputs supporting named colors, hex strings, and RGB tuples. It raises ValidationError on invalid inputs. No network, file, or dynamic code execution is present. The import of ValidationError from a relative module is standard in modular codebases. The color dictionary is static and contains no malicious entries. The validation logic is simple and correct, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard color parsing utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
