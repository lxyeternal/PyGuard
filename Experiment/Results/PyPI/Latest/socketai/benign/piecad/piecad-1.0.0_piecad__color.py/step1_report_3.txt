{
  "purpose": "This code provides color validation and parsing for various CSS color specifications, supporting named colors, HEX strings, and RGB tuples.",
  "sources": "User or application inputs can be provided as color strings (e.g., '#00FF00', 'aqua') or tuples of RGB values (e.g., (0, 255, 0)).",
  "sinks": "Parsed color data returned as tuples; potential injection points are limited to input validation functions, which do not execute untrusted data as code.",
  "flows": "Input strings or tuples are validated and then mapped or converted into RGB tuples, with no execution of untrusted data as code or command.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code performs straightforward validation and parsing without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary of color names mapped to RGB tuples, supports parsing hex strings and tuples, and raises validation errors for invalid inputs. The validation logic is standard and does not execute untrusted data as code. No network operations, system calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign color parsing utility with no malicious intent. It strictly validates input colors and converts them into RGB tuples without executing any code or performing suspicious activities. There is no evidence of malware or security risks.",
