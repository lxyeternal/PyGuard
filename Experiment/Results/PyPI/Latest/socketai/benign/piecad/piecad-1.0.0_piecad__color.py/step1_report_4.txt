  "purpose": "Defines and parses CSS color specifications for use in coloring objects during save or view operations.",
  "sources": "Color input data: string (CSS color name, hex value), tuple of RGB values.",
  "sinks": "Color values returned by _parse_color; no direct sink for untrusted data since no external or dangerous operations are performed.",
  "flows": "Input (color specification) -> _parse_color function -> output (validated RGB tuple).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated segments observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a dictionary of CSS color keywords mapped to RGB tuples. It includes a parsing function _parse_color that accepts color specifications either as hex strings, color names, or RGB tuples, validating inputs for correctness. The code performs validation checks to prevent invalid color formats and ranges but does not perform any network operations, file writes, or system modifications. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior detected. No use of insecure functions or obfuscated code. The import of a possibly non-standard module '.ValidationError' is a benign reference for exception handling, assuming it is a standard exception class within the package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, non-malicious utility for color validation and conversion. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The code appears safe with no indication of malware or malicious intent.",
