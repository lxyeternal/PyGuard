{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for bulk operations on 2D and 3D objects, such as composition, difference, hull, intersection, and union, likely for 3D modeling or CAD operations.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (objs) where input objects are received; type checks on these inputs.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output new Obj2d or Obj3d instances; internal method calls such as _m.CrossSection.compose, _m.Manifold.batch_boolean, _m.CrossSection.batch_hull, _m.Manifold.batch_hull, etc., which process object data.",
  "flows": "Input objects are validated and their 'mo' attribute is extracted; these are passed into various batch or compose methods in the _m module; resulting data is used to create new Obj2d or Obj3d instances.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard with no unusual or obfuscated constructs; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors observed; external library _m is used for core computations but no suspicious API calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements multiple geometric set operations with type validation and basic error handling. Functions check for object types, handle empty inputs, and raise validation errors for mixed types, which is standard practice. The use of _m module functions like compose, batch_boolean, batch_hull suggests reliance on an external computational library, which appears typical for 3D modeling software. No data exfiltration, network communication, or hidden behaviors are evident. The code lacks any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. It strictly performs geometric operations, aligning with intended functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is well-structured for geometric bulk operations without any signs of malicious intent or supply chain attacks. It operates solely on object data and external library functions, with no indicators of malicious behavior or data leakage. No suspicious or malicious anomalies are detected.",
