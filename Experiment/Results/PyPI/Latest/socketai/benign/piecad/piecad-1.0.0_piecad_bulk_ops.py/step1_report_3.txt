{
  "purpose": "The code provides miscellaneous bulk operations for 2D and 3D objects, such as compose, difference, hull, intersect, and union, to manipulate geometric objects within a 3D modeling library.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input objects passed as *objs parameters to each function, specifically from their 'mo' attribute which holds their geometric data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include the batch_boolean and batch_hull functions from the manifold3d library, where untrusted data could be processed. No direct sinks such as network, file, or environment variable access are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input objects through the 'mo' attribute into batch_boolean, batch_hull, or compose methods in the manifold3d library. These functions perform geometric operations based on input data, which could be manipulated if malicious data is injected, but the code itself does not perform further untrusted operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard geometric operation wrappers. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. ValidationError is used for type checks, no dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines multiple geometric operation functions, each starting with type validation (_chkGOTY) and ensuring all objects are of the same type. Operations such as compose, difference, hull, intersect, and union utilize methods from the manifold3d library, passing collections of object data ('mo') into batch operations. The code performs standard input validation and calls to well-defined library functions without any code injection, dynamic execution, or data leakage mechanisms. No network or file operations are involved, and no suspicious data handling is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate geometric operations with proper validation and no signs of malicious behavior. It processes data solely within the library context, with no evidence of hidden backdoors or malicious actions. Overall, it appears safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
