{
  "purpose": "The code provides miscellaneous bulk operations for 2D and 3D objects, such as composition, difference, hull, intersection, and union, primarily for manipulating geometric models.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters `objs` (variable number of Obj2d or Obj3d objects). It also imports the `manifold3d` library, which may load or process external data internally.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of the external library functions (`_m.CrossSection.compose`, `_m.Manifold.batch_boolean`, etc.) which could internally handle untrusted data; however, no explicit untrusted data handling is visible here. No network, file, or environment variable access is evident.",
  "flows": "Input objects are checked for type consistency; their internal `mo` attributes are passed to the `manifold3d` library functions for geometric operations, returning new Obj2d or Obj3d objects. No external data flows directly from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard geometric operations with no obvious hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variables are present. The use of the external library `_m` is standard, assuming it is trusted.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple geometric operations on Obj2d and Obj3d objects, with input validation and type consistency checks. It primarily relies on the imported `manifold3d` library for processing. There are no signs of malicious data handling, external network access, or backdoors. The functions return new geometric objects without side effects or data exfiltration. The early check for empty input returns default objects, which is benign. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior is detected based on the visible code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard set of geometric utility functions with no malicious intent. It performs expected operations and validates input types properly. There are no suspicious data flows, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities evident. Overall, the code seems safe from a supply chain perspective.",
