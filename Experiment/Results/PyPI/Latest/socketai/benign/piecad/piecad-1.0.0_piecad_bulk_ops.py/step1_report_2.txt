{
  "purpose": "Provides bulk operations (compose, difference, hull, intersect, union) on 2D and 3D objects for 3D modeling or CAD applications.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: *objs (variable number of Obj2d or Obj3d instances).",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe operations if objects contain malicious data, such as malicious mo attributes, but no explicit data leaks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input objects are checked for type consistency, their 'mo' attributes are extracted, then processed via _m library functions for boolean operations or hulls, returning new objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, no network activity, no dynamic code execution. Functions perform standard geometric operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs bulk geometric operations on 2D and 3D objects, validating types, handling empty input cases, and delegating core processing to external _m library functions. No external data sources or sinks that could be malicious are used. The code appears straightforward, with proper type checks and validation. There are no signs of backdoors, hidden behaviors, or malicious intent. The presence of iframe HTML comments is harmless and likely documentation or examples. No credential handling, network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of geometric bulk operations with no evident malicious or security-compromising behavior. It relies on external, presumably trusted, library functions for processing. No security risks or malware indicators were detected.",
