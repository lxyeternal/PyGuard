{
  "purpose": "Provides bulk geometric operations (compose, difference, hull, intersect, union) on Obj2d and Obj3d objects, validating input types and delegating computations to external library functions.",
  "sources": "Input objects' 'mo' attributes used in batch functions; type validation checks.",
  "sinks": "External library functions (_m.CrossSection, _m.Manifold) processing data; no external data sources or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input objects -> type validation -> external batch functions -> new Obj2d/Obj3d instances.",
  "anomalies": "Accessing 'objs[0]' before checking if 'objs' is empty; potential IndexError if called with no arguments.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard geometric operations with proper type validation, relying on external trusted functions. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious external activity is evident. The main technical flaw is the order of length check and access to 'objs[0]', which could cause runtime errors if functions are called with no arguments. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero; the security risk score is low (0.1-0.2), considering reliance on external library functions. No signs of malicious behavior or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward geometric utility module with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, assuming the external library '_m' is trustworthy. Minor logical correction regarding empty input handling is recommended but does not impact security.",
