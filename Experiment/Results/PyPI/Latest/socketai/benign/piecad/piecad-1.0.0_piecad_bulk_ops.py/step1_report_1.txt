{
  "purpose": "Provides bulk geometric operations (compose, difference, hull, intersect, union) on 2D and 3D objects within a 3D modeling library.",
  "sources": "Input objects passed as *objs arguments in each function; type checks and iteration over these objects.",
  "sinks": "Batch boolean operations (_m.CrossSection.batch_boolean, _m.Manifold.batch_boolean) on object data; no external untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input objects → type validation → collection into list → batch operations on _m cross-sections or manifolds.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Usage of external module manifold3d but no suspicious function calls. No network activity or data exfiltration. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs type checks and calls batch geometric operations on input objects, returning combined or modified objects. It handles empty inputs by returning default objects. No signs of malicious code such as network activity, file operations, or data leakage are present. The functions rely solely on the provided objects and internal batch methods, which seem to be standard geometric operations. The structure and logic are consistent with typical geometry manipulation code. No suspicious anomalies or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of bulk geometric operations for 2D and 3D objects with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected type validation and calls established batch methods for geometric calculations.",
