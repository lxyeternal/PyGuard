  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, optimized utility for degree-based trigonometry functions with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing security and malware scores are appropriate; the risk score could be conservatively set at 0.1 due to hardcoded lookup tables, but overall, the code is safe and straightforward."
