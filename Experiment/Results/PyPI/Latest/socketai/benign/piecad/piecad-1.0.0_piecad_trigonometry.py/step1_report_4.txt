  "purpose": "Provides trigonometric functions that operate with degrees and optimize common angles with precomputed values.",
  "sources": "Reading input angles in functions (cos, sin, tan, their hyperbolic versions, and inverse functions).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No network, file, or system modification operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input angles are converted and used in mathematical computations; precomputed values serve as quick lookup sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of absolute value and modulo on angles could potentially obscure unusual input patterns, but no malicious intent observed. The code only performs mathematical operations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Commented out undefined tan values are benign and typical for hyperbolic tangent functions at asymptotes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of functions for trigonometric and hyperbolic calculations in degrees, with optimization for common angles using lookup tables. The lookup tables are explicitly hardcoded but contain only standard trigonometric values. The functions handle angles modularly, avoiding out-of-range issues. No network, file, or system commands are executed. No obfuscation techniques, hidden code, or malicious logic are present. All functions are straightforward wrappers over math module functions, with some caching. The only concern could be the commented-out undefined tan values at asymptotes, but they are standard mathematical points and do not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for degree-based trigonometry, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe, optimized, and well-structured for its purpose.",
