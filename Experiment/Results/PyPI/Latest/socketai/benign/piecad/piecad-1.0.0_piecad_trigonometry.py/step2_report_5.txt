  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code provides standard trigonometric functions with lookup tables for common angles, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and safe mathematical wrappers.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues. The high confidence (1.0) aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the use of lookup tables for optimization, with no malicious activity. Slightly lower confidence (0.95) but still high.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk of 0.1 is reasonable, given the presence of hardcoded values, but these are standard for performance, not malicious. No evidence of malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Reiterates the benign nature, straightforward math wrappers, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is purely mathematical.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar analysis, no malicious indicators, only performance optimization.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk, but justified due to hardcoded values, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as others, standard implementation, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk, but still consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0.0. The code contains no malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.0 to 0.2) are justified based on the presence of hardcoded lookup tables, which are common optimization techniques but do not pose security risks.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — No evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — Clear, readable, and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Slightly elevated due to hardcoded values, but not a security concern.\n\n**Note:** The lookup tables for common angles are standard practice for performance and precision, not malicious obfuscation or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a well-implemented, optimized utility for degree-based trigonometry, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's characteristics.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0**\n- **Risk:** **0.1**\n\nThese reflect the benign, transparent, and standard nature of the code.",
