{
  "purpose": "The code provides trigonometric functions that operate with angles in degrees, including conversions, and optimized lookups for common angles.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily from function arguments such as 'angleInDegrees', 'cosVal', 'sinVal', 'tanVal', 'y', and 'x'. No external data sources or network inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include computed trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, and inverse functions returning angles in degrees. No sinks that lead to data exfiltration or system modification are evident.",
  "flows": "Input angles are processed through conversion functions and lookups; data flows from function arguments through calculations to return values. No suspicious flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior observed. The code contains hardcoded cosine, sine, and tangent values for specific angles, which is standard optimization. No obfuscated code, malicious functions, or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard mathematical functions for trigonometry in degrees, using a combination of quick lookup tables for common angles and computations via the math library. No dynamic code execution, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Hyperbolic and inverse functions are straightforward wrappers around math library calls. All inputs are used in mathematical calculations without unsafe operations or external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, optimized implementation of degree-based trigonometric functions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The hardcoded lookup tables are typical for performance enhancement and do not introduce security risks.",
