{
  "purpose": "Provide trigonometric functions that operate with angles in degrees, including exact values for common angles, and hyperbolic functions.",
  "sources": "Read input angles in degrees; access to predefined sine, cosine, and tangent lookup dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Return computed trigonometric or hyperbolic values; no data flows to external systems or networks.",
  "flows": "Input angles are processed either via lookup tables or converted to radians for math library functions; results are returned as floats.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded lookup tables for common angles, which could be considered an optimization rather than suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious imports observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, converting angles between degrees and radians. It employs lookup tables for common angles to optimize performance, falling back to math library functions for others. No suspicious input/output behaviors, network access, or hidden functionalities are detected. The code does not contain malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It appears to be a straightforward mathematical utility module with some performance optimizations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign mathematical utility for degree-based trigonometry, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It contains no malware indicators, backdoors, or data leaks.",
