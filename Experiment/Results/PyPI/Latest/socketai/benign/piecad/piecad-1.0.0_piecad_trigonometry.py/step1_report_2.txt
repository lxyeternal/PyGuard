{
  "purpose": "Provides trigonometric functions that operate with degrees instead of radians, including exact values for common angles and hyperbolic functions.",
  "sources": "Input angles from function arguments, possibly from user input if functions are called with untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "Mathematical functions (`math.sin`, `math.cos`, etc.), but these are standard and safe; no direct sinks for untrusted data leading to security issues.",
  "flows": "Input angles -> conversion to radians or normalization -> lookup or calculation -> return results; no data flows leading to data leaks or system effects.",
  "anomalies": "Precomputed lookup tables for sine, cosine, and tangent at common angles, which is normal for performance but could obscure the true behavior if manipulated. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard mathematical transformations and uses lookup tables for exact values at common angles, which is typical for performance and precision. No malicious network calls, file access, or obfuscated code features are present. The functions for hyperbolic and inverse trig functions are direct wrappers around math library functions. The code does not perform any suspicious activities such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system modification. The presence of commented undefined tangent values at 90 and 270 degrees indicates awareness of undefined behaviors but no evidence of malicious intent. Overall, the code appears purely mathematical with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a mathematical utility module for degree-based trigonometry functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It provides performance optimizations through lookup tables and handles typical mathematical operations safely.",
