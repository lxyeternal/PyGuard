  "purpose": "Provides degree-based trigonometric functions with exact values for common angles, optimizing performance with lookup tables.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded lookup tables for sine, cosine, and tangent values at specific angles.",
  "sinks": "No external data input or output; no data leaks or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input angle (degrees) -> lookup table or calculation -> output value; no external data flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded lookup tables for common angles; handling of undefined tangent at 90 and 270 degrees is standard but noted.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward mathematical functions with lookup tables for common angles to optimize performance. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The lookup tables are standard optimization techniques, not malicious payloads. The hyperbolic functions and inverse functions are simple wrappers around math library calls. The handling of angles uses modular arithmetic, and the lookup tables cover key angles. No external data or network activity is involved. The minor concern about undefined tangent values at 90 and 270 degrees is standard and not malicious. The code is transparent, well-structured, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, optimized utility for degree-based trigonometry functions with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing security and malware scores are appropriate; the risk score could be conservatively set at 0.1 due to hardcoded lookup tables, but overall, the code is safe and straightforward.",
