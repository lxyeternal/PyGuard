  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: presence of issues, logical flaws, score appropriateness, and potential malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is a safe, optimized implementation of degree-based trigonometry functions, with no malicious behavior or malware indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0, securityRisk = 0.0\n- **Assessment:** The report is consistent and accurate. The code contains only standard mathematical functions and lookup tables for common angles, which are typical optimizations. No suspicious activity is detected.\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed. The scores align with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's mathematical nature, with no malicious activity, network calls, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The security risk score is slightly above zero, likely reflecting a cautious stance due to hardcoded lookup tables. However, these are standard for performance optimization and do not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n- **Justification for higher score:** The small securityRisk (0.1) seems reasonable given the presence of hardcoded constants, but no actual security risk exists.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above, with consistent reasoning.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's benign nature.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, standard mathematical functions with lookup tables, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The slight security risk score is justified due to the use of hardcoded lookup tables, but no actual security concern exists.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the correctness and benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) due to the lookup tables, but still no actual security threat.\n- **Verdict:** The score is acceptable, though perhaps slightly conservative.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (0.0).\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation (0.0).\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are reasonable, given the use of hardcoded constants for optimization but no actual security risk.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — No evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Slightly elevated due to hardcoded lookup tables, but not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a safe, optimized utility for degree-based trigonometry functions. The existing scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are, with perhaps a very slight adjustment to the security risk score (e.g., 0.1) to reflect the minor concern over hardcoded constants, but overall, the code is benign.",
