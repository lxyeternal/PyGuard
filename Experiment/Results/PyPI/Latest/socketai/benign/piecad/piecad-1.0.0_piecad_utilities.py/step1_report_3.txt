{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for loading, saving, viewing, and manipulating 3D and 2D objects, primarily using the trimesh library and custom classes Obj2d and Obj3d, with auxiliary visualization and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from filenames via the 'load' and 'save' functions; object properties such as '_color' and bounding boxes are accessed; data is retrieved from the 'config' dictionary; network communication occurs in '_view_handler' through HTTP requests; 'inspect.stack()' is used for debugging info.",
  "sinks": "Data sent via HTTP POST requests in '_view_handler' (potential data exfiltration if view data contains sensitive info); file write operations in '_save_svg' and 'save' functions; JSON serialization of view data in 'view'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file input in 'load' to object creation; object properties and transformations flow into file output in 'save'; in 'view', object data flows into JSON, then over HTTP to a viewer service; 'inspect.stack()' info is used internally for debugging, not external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual or misleading code constructs; network code in '_view_handler' could potentially be misused for data exfiltration if view data contains sensitive info; no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles object I/O, visualization, and some utility functions. The network communication in '_view_handler' transmits visualization data over HTTP, which could be exploited for unintended data leakage but appears intended for visualization purposes. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present. The use of 'inspect.stack()' is only for internal debugging info. File operations are straightforward and do not involve untrusted input beyond filenames. Overall, the code does not contain malicious behavior, but the network functionality could be misused if view data contains sensitive information.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate functions for 3D/2D object management and visualization without signs of malicious intent. The network component is potentially risky if sensitive data is visualized, but it appears intended for visualization rather than malicious exfiltration. No malware, backdoors, or hardcoded credentials detected. The overall security risk is low.",
