{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for loading, saving, viewing, and processing 3D and 2D geometric objects, primarily for CAD and mesh manipulation.",
  "sources": "Reads file data for loading objects, reads configuration settings, accesses object properties, and reads from the view queue.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sends data via HTTP POST requests to a viewer host; writes SVG files; loads files from disk.",
  "flows": "File input/output for load/save; data serialization for viewing; HTTP requests sending view data; file path processing for load/save; SVG content creation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of threading for visualization, dynamic HTTP connection handling, and the creation of SVG content. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious external calls, or obfuscated code observed. No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard functions for mesh and object file handling, visualization, and SVG export. It interacts with external resources (files, HTTP server) but does so in a benign manner, primarily for visualization and file management. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or unauthorized data access are detected. The HTTP interaction is confined to a specified host, and no data is exfiltrated in an unexpected way. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious anomalies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for CAD and mesh processing with visualization capabilities. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. The only network activity involves sending commands and data to a local or specified viewer server, which is typical for visualization tools.",
