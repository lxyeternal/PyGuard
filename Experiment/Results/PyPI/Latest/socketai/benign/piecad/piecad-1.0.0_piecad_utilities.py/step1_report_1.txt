{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for loading, saving, viewing, and analyzing 3D and 2D geometric objects, including file format support, visualization, and polygon winding analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from filenames for loading/saving objects, accesses configuration data for viewer availability and units, and uses inspect to obtain call stack info for debugging.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data over an HTTP connection for visualization purposes and writes SVG files to disk. No untrusted input handling or data leaks are evident outside expected file operations and network requests.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves reading filenames and configuration to load or save objects, passing object data to a viewer via network, and generating SVG content from object properties. There are no indications of untrusted data being used insecurely in critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The network connection is used solely for visualization, with error handling to disable the viewer if connectivity fails. No obfuscation, code injection, or malware patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a geometric object processing library with visualization capabilities. It relies on external libraries for mesh processing and uses network communication only for displaying objects. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security risks are evident. The code includes normal error handling and no unusual or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward geometric processing and visualization module with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It operates within expected parameters, using network and file I/O for visualization and storage without any suspicious activity.",
