{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for loading, saving, and visualizing 3D and 2D geometric objects, primarily for CAD and mesh processing.",
  "sources": "File input/output for various mesh formats, network requests to a CAD viewer server, and internal function calls for object processing.",
  "sinks": "Network requests sending view data to an external CAD viewer server; file writes for saving objects and SVG images.",
  "flows": "Data flows from object methods to mesh conversion, then to network requests or file outputs; visualization data flows from objects to network or SVG files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. Network communication occurs without authentication, which could be a minor security concern but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code handles standard geometric data processing, file I/O, and visualization via network requests. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The network interactions are solely for visualization purposes and do not involve data exfiltration or malicious activities. The use of inspect for debugging info and the absence of secrets or suspicious patterns support a benign assessment. The security concern is the lack of authentication in network requests, which could be exploited if exposed externally, but this does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate CAD/mesh processing library with visualization features. No signs of malware or malicious intent are detected. The minor security concern regarding unauthenticated network communication is noted but does not elevate the overall risk significantly.",
