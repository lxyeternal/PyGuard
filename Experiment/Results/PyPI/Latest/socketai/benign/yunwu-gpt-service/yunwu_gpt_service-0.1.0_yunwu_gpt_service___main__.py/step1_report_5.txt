{
  "purpose": "The script interfaces with an external GPT service, sending user input and returning the generated response.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from stdin; retrieves API key from environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Sends user input and API key in HTTP request headers; outputs response to stdout.",
  "flows": "User input (stdin) -> call_gpt_service() -> requests.post() -> response handling -> stdout output.",
  "anomalies": "Uses environment variables for API keys, which is standard; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code reads user input securely from stdin, retrieves API credentials from environment variables, and makes a standard HTTP POST request to an external API. It properly handles exceptions and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system manipulation. There are no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated logic. The code’s behavior aligns with typical API interaction patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of a user input relay to an external GPT API service. It contains no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is a benign, standard application code for interacting with an external AI service.",
