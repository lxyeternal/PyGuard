  "purpose": "To define and configure the packaging and installation details for the 'yunwu_gpt_service' Python project, including dependencies and console scripts.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package requirements from 'install_requires' and the main entry point from 'entry_points'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code primarily sets up package metadata and does not process runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures detected. The code is standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setuptools functions to specify package metadata, dependencies, and console entry points. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The dependencies and entry points are typical for Python package setup. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior is present. It appears to be a straightforward setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
