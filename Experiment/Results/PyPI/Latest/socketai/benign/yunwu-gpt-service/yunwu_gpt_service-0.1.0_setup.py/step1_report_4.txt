{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'yunwu_gpt_service'.",
  "sources": "The script reads package dependencies via the 'install_requires' parameter and imports from 'setuptools'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external data handling beyond dependencies declaration.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script defines package setup configuration, not runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setuptools functions to configure packaging details. It specifies a package name, version, automatically finds packages, declares a dependency on 'requests>=2.0', and defines an entry point for a console script. All elements are typical for Python package setup files, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or unusual logic.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python setup script for packaging a project with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It follows common practices for Python project configuration.",
