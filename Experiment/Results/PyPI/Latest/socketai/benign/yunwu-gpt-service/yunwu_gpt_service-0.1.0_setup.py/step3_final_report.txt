  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the Python package 'yunwu_gpt_service', defining metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Package metadata declarations, dependencies, and entry point definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; static setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, external data fetching, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. It declares package info, dependencies, and CLI entry points in a standard manner. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores from reports are consistent with this benign nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and minimal security risk scores justified by the static, straightforward code.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign, standard package configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
