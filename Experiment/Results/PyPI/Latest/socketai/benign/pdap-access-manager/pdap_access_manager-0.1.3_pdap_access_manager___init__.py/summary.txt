  "conclusion": "Benign reports (1-3) are accurately scored with low malware and risk levels. Suspicious reports (4-5) demonstrate signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, justifying higher scores. The analysis aligns with standard security assessment practices, and the scores reflect the observed behaviors and patterns. Overall, the evaluation is consistent and appropriately cautious."
