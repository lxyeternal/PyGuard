  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to perform a specific function that is not explicitly stated, but it appears to involve network or system operations based on the structure.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, input functions, or external network sources.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, outputs to the console, or sends data over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (file/network outputs), passing through intermediate processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no use of obfuscated code or suspicious language features detected. Code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input or environment variables, processes the data, and potentially outputs or transmits it. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or cryptomining activities are visible. Usage of standard libraries and no suspicious network connections or file modifications are detected. The code’s intent appears benign, but incomplete context limits full assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The code appears standard and non-malicious, with no suspicious anomalies or malware indicators. However, limited context prevents absolute certainty.",
