  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code's logic aligns with the described purpose: managing tokens, login, refresh, and requests.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No evident errors or flaws. The report correctly notes the absence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware score of 0 seems appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Risk justification:** The overall security risk is low (0.2), consistent with the report.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment appears accurate; the code is a legitimate API client with proper token handling.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code's flow matches the description: token management, request handling, and refresh logic.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious behaviors or flaws identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious intent.\n- **Risk justification:** The low security risk (0.2) is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis aligns with the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code manages tokens, requests, and refreshes correctly.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware score of 0 is justified; no malware detected.\n- **Risk justification:** Security risk remains low (0.2).\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion that this is a standard API client with no malicious behavior is accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code's behavior matches the described token management and request flow.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies or suspicious activity noted.\n- **Scores:** Malware score of 0 is consistent.\n- **Risk justification:** The low security risk score is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate; no malicious activity is evident.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code manages tokens, login, refresh, and requests as described.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Risk justification:** The low security risk aligns with the code's behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly characterizes the code as a standard, secure API client.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior—no malicious activities or backdoors are present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk scores:** All at 0.2, reflecting low security risk, which is appropriate given the code's functionality.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores across all reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- No modifications are necessary based on the analysis.\n- The code appears legitimate, with no signs of supply chain threats, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, understandable code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, standard API client behavior)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a well-structured, legitimate API client for token-based authentication, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
