      "conclusion": "The code itself does not contain malware or malicious behavior but has significant security concerns due to unvalidated data injection from external DLLs. The use of unusual delimiters suggests possible obfuscation, but no direct malicious payloads are evident. The main risk stems from trusting external code and updating the global namespace without validation."

      "conclusion": "The Python wrapper code is benign and functions as intended; the main risk stems from external DLLs that could be malicious or compromised. Implementing DLL integrity verification and sandboxing would mitigate potential supply chain risks."
