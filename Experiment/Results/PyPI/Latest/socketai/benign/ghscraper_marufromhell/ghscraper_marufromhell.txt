No active malware, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The main risks stem from cloning untrusted repositories and collecting personal data, but these do not classify as malicious activity. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate; malware score should be 0, obfuscated 0, and security risk around 0.3 to reflect moderate privacy and misuse potential."
