  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and code anomalies.",
  "sources": "Use of eval(), environment variables, hardcoded URLs, dynamic code execution, insecure functions like os.system(), input/output data flows.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, command execution, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval() or environment reads leading to sinks like network or file operations, indicating potential malicious or insecure activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval(), hardcoded URLs/IPs, dynamic code execution, insecure functions, inconsistent obfuscation patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns of insecure practices such as eval() and hardcoded URLs, which suggest potential malicious intent or vulnerabilities. No explicit malicious payloads like data exfiltration or backdoors are confirmed, but the suspicious patterns justify moderate concern. The absence of code in some reports correctly results in zero scores. The scores for obfuscation and malware are consistent with the described patterns, with the highest suspicion in report 3. The overall security risk is justified based on insecure coding practices, but no confirmed malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows some insecure and obfuscated patterns but lacks confirmed malicious payloads. The scores are consistent with the observed patterns, with moderate malware and obfuscation suspicion and a security risk reflecting potential vulnerabilities. No significant revisions are necessary.",
