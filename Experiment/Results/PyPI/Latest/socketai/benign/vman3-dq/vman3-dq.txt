      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for survey data processing, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the use of pandas.eval(), which should be used cautiously if expressions originate from untrusted sources. Given the controlled context, the risk is minimal. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting cautious acknowledgment of eval() usage. The reports' scores are consistent with this assessment."

      "conclusion": "The analysis indicates low to moderate suspicion primarily due to dynamic code execution and obfuscation signs in Report 1. No definitive malware is present, and other code snippets appear benign. The scores are appropriate but could be marginally adjusted if further evidence of obfuscation or malicious behavior emerges."
