  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'vman3_dq', including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description; package metadata and dependencies declarations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external code execution points present.",
  "flows": "Initialization of package metadata and dependencies; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and typical for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script using setuptools, with no suspicious or malicious code. It reads a README file, specifies dependencies, classifiers, package data, and metadata. The dependencies are common data science libraries, and no dynamic code execution or network activity is present. The reports provided are empty responses with no substantive content, indicating no identified issues or vulnerabilities. Given the absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior, the code appears benign. The lack of detailed reports prevents any claims of issues, and the scores should reflect minimal risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The empty reports do not indicate any issues. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
