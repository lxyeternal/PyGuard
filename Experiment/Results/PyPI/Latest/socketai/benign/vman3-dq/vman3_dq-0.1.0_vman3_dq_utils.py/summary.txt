  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The analysis indicates low to moderate suspicion primarily due to dynamic code execution and obfuscation signs in Report 1. No definitive malware is present, and other code snippets appear benign. The scores are appropriate but could be marginally adjusted if further evidence of obfuscation or malicious behavior emerges."
