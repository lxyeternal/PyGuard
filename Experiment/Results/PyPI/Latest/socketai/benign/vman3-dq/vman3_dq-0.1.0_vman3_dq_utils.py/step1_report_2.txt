  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to the absence of code content, making it difficult to determine its exact intent.",
  "sources": "The code potentially reads input from standard input, environment variables, or external files (exact sources cannot be confirmed due to lack of code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls, but specific details are unavailable without actual code content.",
  "flows": "The data flow from sources to sinks cannot be determined without seeing the actual code; no explicit source-to-sink pathways are evident.",
  "anomalies": "There are no visible anomalies, hard-coded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns in the provided blank code snippet.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of actual code content, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. No suspicious behavior or security issues are identifiable from empty or non-existent code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided input (which contains no code), there is no evidence of malicious behavior, anomalies, or security risks. The code appears benign or is simply not present.",
