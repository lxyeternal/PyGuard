{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a web server and handle incoming requests, potentially for data processing or API responses.",
  "sources": "Input sources include network requests (HTTP GET/POST), possibly reading environment variables for configuration, and file I/O if present.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs include network responses, logging outputs, or database writes. Malicious activity could occur if untrusted data is executed or sent unencrypted.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input from network requests or environment variables flows into processing functions, possibly reaching database or response functions without validation.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious obfuscation. Look for dynamic code execution, unusual imports, or hidden network connections—none evident here.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with setting up a web server, importing standard libraries, and defining request handlers. No signs of malicious behavior such as reverse shells, data exfiltration, or network connections to suspicious domains are detected. The code uses common patterns, and dependencies appear standard. There are no obfuscated parts, and no sensitive data handling that raises suspicion. The flow from input to output seems straightforward and typical for a web application.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code performs standard server setup and request handling with no suspicious anomalies.",
