{
  "purpose": "Exports functions change_null_toskipped and parse_odk_relevance_to_mask from the local core module, indicating they are part of a package interface.",
  "sources": "Imports from .core module within the package, no external data sources or inputs are read here.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data access in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths observable in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears minimal; no suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Only module exports are defined.",
  "analysis": "This code is a straightforward module definition, importing two functions from a local core module and defining __all__ for exports along with a version string. There are no input or output operations, no data processing, and no suspicious behaviors. The code structure is simple and standard for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, benign module export setup with no signs of malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security concerns within this fragment.",
