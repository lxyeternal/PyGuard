{
  "purpose": "The code exports specific functions from the local core module and defines the package version.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.core' for functions 'change_null_toskipped' and 'parse_odk_relevance_to_mask'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to potential vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward module metadata and function exports.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of an import statement, an export list, and a version declaration. It does not perform any input/output operations, data processing, or network activity. The imported functions are from a relative module, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. There is no obfuscated or unusual syntax. Overall, the code appears standard for a Python module's __init__.py or similar setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only standard import and export statements with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
