{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions from a local module and defines module metadata, likely for use in a larger Python package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module: '.core'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output functions that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the '.core' module into the current module via import; no user input or external data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports two functions from a local module and defines the __all__ and __version__ variables. There are no dynamic code executions, data manipulations, or suspicious constructs. The functions imported are not shown, but their import does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard module initialization code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves to expose specific functions for external use and defines package versioning.",
