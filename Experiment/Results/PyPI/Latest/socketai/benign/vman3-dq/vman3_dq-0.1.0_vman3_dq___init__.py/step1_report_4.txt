  "purpose": "The code exports two functions from a local module for external use and defines the package version.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the same package/module, access to __all__ and __version__ variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data output or external communication is visible",
  "flows": "No data flows are apparent; the code simply imports and exports identifiers, and sets a version string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are evident; code is minimal and standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from a local module, defines what symbols are exported, and sets a version string. It lacks any data input handling, network communication, or system modification. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, standard package setup code with no malicious intent or security risks.",
