  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n```python\nfrom .core import change_null_toskipped, parse_odk_relevance_to_mask\n\n__all__ = ['change_null_toskipped', 'parse_odk_relevance_to_mask']\n__version__ = '0.1.0'\n```\n\n**Assessment of the code:**\n- It imports two functions from a local module `.core`.\n- It defines `__all__` to specify exported symbols.\n- It sets a version string.\n\n**Review of the reports:**\n\nAll five reports consistently describe this code as a minimal, straightforward module that imports functions from a local module and exposes them, along with version info. No data flows, no external data handling, no network activity, no suspicious patterns, no anomalies, and no obfuscation are observed.\n\n**Are the reported issues present?**  \n- No. The code is simple and standard. No malicious behavior, no vulnerabilities, no suspicious logic.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n- The reports are accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign, with no security concerns.\n\n**Scores given to each issue:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n\nThese scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n- None. The code is benign, so higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n**Malware score considerations:**  \n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the code's harmless nature.\n\n**Claims based on assumptions:**  \n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent; the reports avoid unwarranted assumptions.\n\n**Score consistency:**  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated overall risk score:** **0**\n\nThe code is a standard module setup with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, with no security risks or malware indications. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
