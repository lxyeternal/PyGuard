  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for survey data processing, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the use of pandas.eval(), which should be used cautiously if expressions originate from untrusted sources. Given the controlled context, the risk is minimal. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting cautious acknowledgment of eval() usage. The reports' scores are consistent with this assessment."
