{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for parsing and evaluating relevance expressions in a data collection context, particularly for handling conditional question visibility and null value management in survey data.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from pandas DataFrames (`data_df`, `dictionary_df`) and extracts variables, relevance expressions, and data columns.",
  "sinks": "The code evaluates relevance expressions using `pd.DataFrame.eval()` and modifies DataFrame entries based on conditions, notably setting certain null values to 'skipped'.",
  "flows": "Input variables and relevance expressions are parsed and transformed; expressions are evaluated with `pd.eval()`; based on evaluation results, DataFrame entries are modified, especially marking 'skipped' in hidden questions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The code performs data manipulation and expression parsing in a standard manner. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are detected. No suspicious file operations, external network calls, or data exfiltration routines are present.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform expression parsing, variable replacement, and DataFrame modifications. The expression parsing carefully handles `selected()` functions and variable references, converting expressions into evaluable pandas syntax. DataFrame updates set 'skipped' in cases where questions are hidden and data is null or marked as NA/NULL. The code concludes with logical data imputation for age-related fields. There are no indications of malicious payloads, network activity, or backdoors. The code appears to be standard data handling and validation routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data processing utility for survey data, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or obfuscated components. The overall security risk is very low.",
