  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and malicious activities.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include code snippets, imported modules, environment variables, and data handling functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network connections, file operations, environment variable access, and data output points where untrusted data could cause leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input functions or environment variables through processing logic to sinks like network or file operations, where malicious intent could manifest.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected; code is straightforward or absent.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns based on limited or no code snippets. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the observations. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited visibility. Risk scores are conservatively low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal threat but acknowledging some uncertainty in ambiguous or minimal code contexts. No evidence suggests malicious sabotage or supply chain risks. The reasoning is sound, and the scores align with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent, cautious, and appropriate given the limited or absent code evidence. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected, and the low risk scores are justified. No adjustments are necessary unless further code or context reveals hidden threats.",
