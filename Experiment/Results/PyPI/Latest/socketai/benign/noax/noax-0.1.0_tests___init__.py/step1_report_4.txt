  "sinks": "Potential sinks could involve system commands, network communication, or data storage, but none are explicitly evident without seeing the code.",
  "flows": "No clear data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is observed; further code details needed for precise flow analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are apparent from the provided empty code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is empty or missing; based on available information, no malicious or insecure patterns are detectable. The review of code structure, imports, and logic is not possible without actual code content.",
  "conclusion": "Due to lack of code, no malicious behavior or security risks can be determined. The code appears benign or absent, but a review of actual code content is necessary for thorough assessment.",
