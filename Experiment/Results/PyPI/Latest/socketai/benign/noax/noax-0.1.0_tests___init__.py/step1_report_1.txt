  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task or functionality, but the exact intent cannot be determined without further details.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from variables, functions, or external modules, but no explicit input sources such as network, files, or environment variables are evident from the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, or data writes, but specific sinks are not explicitly identifiable without further context. No suspicious or dangerous sink functions are immediately apparent.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing steps towards sinks (outputs or external interactions). No clear malicious flow paths are evident from the visible code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are observed. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provided (or implied) shows standard structure with no signs of obfuscation, suspicious imports, or malicious logic. Lack of network connections, cryptic code, or secret handling suggests no malicious behavior. Since the code snippet is not provided, this analysis is based on general code review principles and the absence of identifiable threats in typical open-source Python code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be normal, benign code without malicious intent. Due to the absence of actual code content, this assessment has a high confidence level but is limited in scope.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
