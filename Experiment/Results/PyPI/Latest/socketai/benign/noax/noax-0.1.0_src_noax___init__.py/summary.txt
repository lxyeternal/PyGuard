  "conclusion": "The reports are mostly accurate; the primary improvement involves increasing the security risk score for code using eval()/exec() to better reflect potential threats. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at zero. The overall security posture remains low risk, with the caveat of cautious handling of dynamic code execution functions."
