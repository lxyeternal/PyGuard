  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be a generic Python script, possibly a utility or a part of a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly from imported modules or external sources if any are present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or data processing functions that could be misused, but none are explicitly shown in the code provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or function arguments to various processing functions, with no clear untrusted data leading to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code structure appears straightforward without obfuscation or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of basic Python functions and standard library usage without complex or suspicious patterns. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection are present. There is no evidence of malware activities or security vulnerabilities. The code is clean and appears benign. Due to lack of external malicious indicators, the likelihood of malicious intent is low.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility or component with no malicious behavior detected. It shows no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks. The overall assessment is that it is safe, based on the provided snippet.",
