  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a demonstration or implementation of a simple utility function, possibly related to data processing or network communication. The exact intent is unclear without additional context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from user prompts, environment variables, and possibly external network sources if network functions are used.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network sockets, file writing, or system commands if the code executes external processes or writes sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (user input, environment variables) to processing functions and potentially to sinks like network transmission or file output.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code does not exhibit obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or secret exfiltration methods.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis shows that the code primarily involves standard input handling, data processing, and possibly network or file operations. There are no indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or hidden backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries appears benign. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present. The code does not contain any suspicious network connections, credential theft mechanisms, or system damage routines.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no indications of malware, data leakage, or supply chain attacks. The overall security risk is low.",
