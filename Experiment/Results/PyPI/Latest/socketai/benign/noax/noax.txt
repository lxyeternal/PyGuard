Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at zero. The overall security posture remains low risk, with the caveat of cautious handling of dynamic code execution functions."

Adjusting the malware score for Report 2 to 0.5 enhances caution without overestimating risk. The overall security posture remains low, with scores reflecting potential but unconfirmed threats."
