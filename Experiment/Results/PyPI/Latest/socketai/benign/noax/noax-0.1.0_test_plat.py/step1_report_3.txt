  "purpose": "The code retrieves and prints the machine type of the host system.",
  "sources": "The 'platform.machine()' function reads system information from the operating system.",
  "sinks": "The 'print()' function outputs data to the console; no untrusted data input or output beyond the system info.",
  "flows": "The system info from 'platform.machine()' flows directly into 'print()' for output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward system information retrieval and display.",
  "analysis": "The code simply calls 'platform.machine()' to obtain hardware architecture details and prints it. No user input, no network activity, no data leaks, or obfuscated code. The function used is standard for system info and does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious behavior, and no external data processing.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign action—retrieving and printing system architecture information with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
