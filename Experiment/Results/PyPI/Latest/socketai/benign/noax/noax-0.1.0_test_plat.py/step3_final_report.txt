  "purpose": "Retrieve and display the system's machine architecture information.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'platform' module and calling 'platform.machine()'.",
  "sinks": "Printing the output to standard output.",
  "flows": "Import 'platform' -> call 'platform.machine()' -> print the result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward retrieval of system info with no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'platform' module, calls 'platform.machine()', and prints the result. It performs a simple system info query without external inputs, network activity, or data leaks. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present. The code is standard and benign, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1, all consistent with its straightforward purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs a standard system info retrieval, and poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The current assessment and scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
