  "purpose": "The code retrieves and prints the machine type of the system using the platform module.",
  "sources": "Reading system information via platform.machine()",
  "sinks": "Printing output to standard output",
  "flows": "Input from the system environment to the print function via platform.machine()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple system information retrieval and display",
  "analysis": "The code imports the platform module and outputs the machine type. This is a common, benign operation used for system identification. There are no hardcoded secrets, user inputs, or data leaks. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The operation is straightforward and limited to retrieving and displaying system info.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign system information query with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
