  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'platform' module, calls 'platform.machine()' to get system architecture info, and prints the result. No user input, network activity, or data manipulation occurs. The code performs a simple system info query and output, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign script that outputs system architecture information. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
