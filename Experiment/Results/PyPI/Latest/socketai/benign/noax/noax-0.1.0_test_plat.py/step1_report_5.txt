  "purpose": "The code retrieves and prints the machine's hardware name using the platform module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system's hardware information via platform.machine()",
  "sinks": "The output is printed to the console; no data is sent elsewhere or stored",
  "flows": "Input: system environment data -> platform.machine() -> print()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward usage of the platform module with no suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports the platform module, calls platform.machine() to get hardware info, and prints the result. It involves no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. There are no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated components. The code's simplicity suggests it's for informational purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply retrieves and displays hardware information.",
