  "sinks": "None present; no data leaks or untrusted data sinks observed",
  "flows": "Import jax -> print statements using jax.default_backend()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious behavior. The code simply uses a standard library function from JAX.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the jax library and prints a greeting message along with the default backend used by JAX. No input is read from untrusted sources, no data is sent over networks, and there are no hidden or malicious operations. The use of jax.default_backend() is a benign library call intended for informational purposes. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward script that utilizes the JAX library to output information. It does not contain malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or security issues. The code is benign and safe.",
