  "purpose": "Implement a spectral convolution layer for neural networks operating in the frequency domain using Fourier transforms.",
  "sources": "Reading input tensor 'x' in __call__ method, particularly 'x' parameter; reading shape and dtype of 'x'; reading 'n_modes' and other attributes for internal logic.",
  "sinks": "Applying FFT and inverse FFT; einsum operation for frequency domain multiplication; potential data leakage if output is used improperly.",
  "flows": "Input 'x' (source) is transformed via FFT, sliced, multiplied with learned weights, then inverse FFT produces output; internal weights are learned parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Use of standard libraries and Fourier transforms. No obfuscation or unusual language features. The weight initialization uses a standard Kaiming scale. No hidden or misleading variables or code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement a legitimate spectral convolution layer for neural networks, utilizing Fourier transforms to perform frequency domain convolutions. It initializes complex weights with random normal distributions scaled appropriately. The core operation involves transforming input data to the frequency domain, selecting specific frequency modes based on 'n_modes', applying learned weights, and then transforming back to spatial domain. The use of 'einsum' for the frequency multiplication is standard in spectral methods. The code includes validation and debugging assertions for input dimensions and data types. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. All operations rely on standard scientific computing and deep learning libraries. No suspicious network activity, hidden code, or credential management is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a spectral convolution layer based on Fourier transforms, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It uses standard practices and libraries for spectral methods in neural networks. No security risks or malware signals are detected.",
