  "purpose": "Implement spectral convolution layers using FFT, following principles from Fourier Neural Operators for high-dimensional PDEs.",
  "sources": "Input tensor, FFT operations, slicing to extract frequency modes.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks; operations are confined to mathematical transformations within the code.",
  "flows": "Input data -> FFT -> frequency mode slicing -> einsum with weights -> inverse FFT -> output tensor.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard spectral convolution: initializing complex weights, applying FFT with shift, slicing frequency modes, contracting with weights via einsum, and transforming back with inverse FFT. Validation assertions in debug mode ensure correct input dimensions and types. No external network activity or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The implementation is a legitimate, standard spectral convolution layer for neural networks, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk and malware scores are appropriate, reflecting the benign and well-understood nature of the code.",
