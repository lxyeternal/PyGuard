  "purpose": "Implement spectral convolution layers for neural networks using Fourier transforms, enabling convolution in the frequency domain with learnable weights.",
  "sources": "Reading input tensor x in __call__ method; accessing class attributes such as self.weight and self.bias during computation.",
  "sinks": "Applying einsum operation to multiply frequency domain input with learned weights; adding bias to output; performing FFT and inverse FFT transformations.",
  "flows": "Input x → FFT transformation → frequency domain slicing → einsum with learned weights → inverse FFT → output",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to perform standard spectral convolution operations. No unusual code constructs, obfuscated language, or hidden behaviors are present. Use of complex weights and FFT shifts is consistent with spectral methods. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for spectral convolution using FFTs, with proper initialization of complex weights, bias handling, and frequency slicing mechanisms. The _coerce_n_modes method properly validates input. The __call__ method applies FFTs, slices frequency modes, performs einsum with learned weights, and reconstructs the spatial domain output, with optional bias addition. No data leaks, malicious network calls, or backdoors are present. The implementation follows standard spectral convolution practices with no evidence of malicious intent or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of spectral convolution for neural networks, adhering to common practices in this domain. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors detected. It functions as intended for spectral neural network layers.",
