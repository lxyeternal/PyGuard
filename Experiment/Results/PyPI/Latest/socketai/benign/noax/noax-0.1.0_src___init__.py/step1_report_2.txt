  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be the installation or setup of a Python package, including importing modules and defining functions or classes for package functionality.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, package imports, and potentially user inputs via function parameters or data files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or system calls where untrusted data could be exploited or data could leak.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables, user input, package data) through functions and modules to sinks such as network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or backdoors. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected. Code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, defines functions, and includes typical setup procedures. There are no signs of malicious payloads such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or suspicious network activity. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated segments are present. The structure and logic follow common package setup patterns. Without hidden code or external obfuscated modules, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package component with no detectable malicious behavior or security risks. It does not exhibit signs of malware, data leakage, or sabotage. Based on the provided snippet, the overall security risk is low.",
