{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing and network communication, possibly involving external data sources or user input.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, or external data files (if any present).",
  "sinks": "Network communication functions, file writing/reading, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data from sources flows into processing functions, then potentially to sinks such as network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials or malicious backdoors observed. Unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscated code was not detected. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed carefully for suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network calls to known malicious domains, or malicious system modifications were found. It uses standard libraries and functions for data handling and communication. The lack of suspicious URL connections, encoded payloads, or hidden behaviors suggests no malware presence. The code's behavior aligns with normal data processing tasks. The absence of obfuscation and suspicious logic indicates a low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious activity. It performs typical data processing and network communication without evident security risks. The overall security risk score is low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
