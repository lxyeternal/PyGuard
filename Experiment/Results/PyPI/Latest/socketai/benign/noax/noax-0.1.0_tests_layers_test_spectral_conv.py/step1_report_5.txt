{
  "purpose": "The code contains unit tests for the SpectralConvND class, testing initialization, forward passes, input validation, bias functionality, and parameter validation across 1D, 2D, and 3D configurations.",
  "sources": "Code reads input tensors for testing convolution operations, configuration parameters for initializing SpectralConvND instances, and fixture for JAX random key.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks, code injection, or malicious actions are present. The code does not send data over network or access system resources beyond standard testing routines.",
  "flows": "Test functions instantiate SpectralConvND with various parameters, then pass controlled input data (mostly arrays of ones or zeros) to test behavior. No untrusted data sources or external outputs are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code follows standard testing practices with no unusual or obfuscated patterns. No dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured as a comprehensive test suite for a spectral convolution layer, covering multiple dimensions and input validation scenarios. It uses standard pytest fixtures, assertions, and exception handling. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious payloads, and no suspicious code anomalies were identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured test suite for the SpectralConvND class. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. All operations are within typical testing procedures, and no malicious signals are present.",
