{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the SpectralConvND class, verifying initialization, forward pass, input validation, bias functionality, and parameter validation across 1D, 2D, and 3D cases.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from controlled tensors (e.g., jnp.ones, jnp.zeros) supplied directly within test functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects; the code is solely for testing purposes.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are passed directly to the SpectralConvND instances, with assertions checking output shapes, values, and error handling; no external data flows or network activity are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code performs standard validation, initialization, and assertion checks without suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured test suite for the SpectralConvND class, covering multiple dimensions and functionalities. It uses deterministic, controlled inputs and assertions to verify expected behaviors. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or network activity, are evident. The validation functions enforce parameter correctness but are standard and not malicious. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or hidden payloads. The test data and assertions are typical for such validation, and no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
