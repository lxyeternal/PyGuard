  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, reasoning flaws, or signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code is a standard test suite for the SpectralConvND class.\n- No reports identify any suspicious code behaviors, malicious payloads, or security risks.\n- The input data used in tests are simple, controlled tensors (ones, zeros), with no external or untrusted data sources.\n- The tests focus on validation, initialization, forward pass, bias functionality, and parameter validation across 1D, 2D, and 3D variants.\n- No signs of obfuscation, code injection, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n- The validation functions (_coerce_n_modes) are standard parameter checks, not malicious.\n\n**Potential issues or anomalies:**\n- The only minor point is the use of the `_coerce_n_modes` method, which enforces correct types and values. This is standard validation logic, not malicious.\n- All test data are deterministic and controlled, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or very low values, which is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Any adjustments needed?**\n- No. The scores are consistent with the code and reports.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a straightforward, well-structured test suite for a spectral convolution layer.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (to reflect standard validation, but overall very low risk)  \n\n**Rationale:** While the code is entirely benign, the presence of validation functions and test assertions is normal but could, in theory, be exploited if misused. However, given the context, the overall risk remains negligible.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a safe, standard test suite with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate.",
