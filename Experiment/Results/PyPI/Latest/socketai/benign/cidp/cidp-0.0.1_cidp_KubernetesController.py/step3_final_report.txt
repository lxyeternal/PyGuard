{
  "purpose": "Kubernetes controller managing Spark pods and services, including pod identification, port allocation, and service creation/deletion.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'HOSTNAME', lists pods and services via Kubernetes API, and allocates ports within a specified range.",
  "sinks": "Creates and deletes Kubernetes services, potentially affecting cluster resources, but no malicious data flow detected.",
  "flows": "Uses 'HOSTNAME' to identify pods, lists pods/services, and creates/deletes services based on internal logic; no external data exfiltration or malicious flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Uses environment variables without validation; port selection via random sampling is standard but could lead to conflicts, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Kubernetes management tasks with straightforward API calls. No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Environment variables are used without validation, which is typical in containerized environments but not inherently malicious. Port allocation uses random sampling within a range, which is standard practice. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert channels. The overall behavior aligns with legitimate cluster management functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Kubernetes utility for Spark deployment management, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The use of environment variables without validation is typical and does not constitute a security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
