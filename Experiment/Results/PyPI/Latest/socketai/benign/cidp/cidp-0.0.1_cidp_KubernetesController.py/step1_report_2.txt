{
  "purpose": "The code defines a KubernetesController class to manage Kubernetes resources such as pods and services, including creating and deleting NodePort services for Spark applications.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (HOSTNAME), loads kubeconfig file, and calls Kubernetes API methods to list pods and services.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies or creates Kubernetes services via self.api.create_namespaced_service and deletes services with self.api.delete_namespaced_service.",
  "flows": "Uses environment variable HOSTNAME to identify specific pods, then uses Kubernetes API to list and manage services and pods, and creates/deletes services based on provided parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Uses standard Kubernetes client libraries. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily interacts with Kubernetes APIs to list pods/services and create/delete services. The only data flow involves retrieving environment variables and calling Kubernetes methods, which are standard operations. There are no signs of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access. All operations rely on standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard Kubernetes management class without malicious intent. It manages Kubernetes resources for Spark jobs. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
