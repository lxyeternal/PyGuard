  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Spark deployment utility for Kubernetes environments, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is low, primarily due to reliance on internal APIs and environment-specific configurations. The current scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged."
