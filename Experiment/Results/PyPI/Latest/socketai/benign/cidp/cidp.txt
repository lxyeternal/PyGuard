The security risk is low, primarily due to reliance on internal APIs and environment-specific configurations. The current scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged."

The use of environment variables without validation is typical and does not constitute a security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
