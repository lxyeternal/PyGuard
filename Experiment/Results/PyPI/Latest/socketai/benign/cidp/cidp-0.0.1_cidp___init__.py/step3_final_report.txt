  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, data flows, potential hardcoded secrets, environment variables, network calls, data sinks",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data exfiltration points",
  "flows": "Source inputs (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks (e.g., network, file system)",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, hidden backdoors",
  "analysis": "All provided code snippets are empty or missing, with no logic, variables, or control flow. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detectable. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the absence of code. Confidence levels are moderate to high when some analysis is performed, and zero when no code is available. The lack of code indicates minimal security risk, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are empty or not provided, leading to a conclusion of no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and very low security risk. The scores across all reports are consistent and justified. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
