{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'cidp' Python SDK via setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input read operations are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs are present; the code primarily configures package metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is straightforward package setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code related to reading 'README.md' is present but inactive; no suspicious variables or secrets are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setuptools.setup' with package metadata. No input reading, data processing, or dynamic execution occurs. The commented-out code for reading 'README.md' is typical in setup files but currently inactive. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The setup appears standard for a Python package with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
