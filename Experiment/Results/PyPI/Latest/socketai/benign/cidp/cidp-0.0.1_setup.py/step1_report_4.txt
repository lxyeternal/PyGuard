{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python SDK named 'cidp' for distribution via a package manager like PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external or untrusted input data; all data is hardcoded within the script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; no untrusted data processing or external connections are involved.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as the script only contains static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. Comments are present but harmless. No dynamic execution or external data handling is observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setuptools configuration for packaging a Python project. It contains package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and package discovery. No external data sources, no code execution, nor sensitive data handling is present. The comments related to 'long_description' are inactive and do not affect behavior. All information appears to be static and intended solely for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward, benign setup configuration script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
