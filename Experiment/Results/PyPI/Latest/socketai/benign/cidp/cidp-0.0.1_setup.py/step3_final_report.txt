  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging the 'cidp' Python SDK with static metadata.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static code with hardcoded metadata; commented-out benign code for reading README.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, external data handling, or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with benign commented-out code; no obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script for packaging a Python project, with static metadata and no dynamic or external data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The commented-out code is harmless. All indicators point to a benign, standard package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are correctly set to 0, consistent with the static and straightforward nature of the code.",
