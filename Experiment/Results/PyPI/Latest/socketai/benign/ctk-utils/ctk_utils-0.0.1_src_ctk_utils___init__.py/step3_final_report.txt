{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom GUI components for a 7-segment display and a blinking colon, primarily for visual representation without external data handling or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Method parameters for configuration, polygon creation functions, and internal state updates within class methods.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; visual updates are confined to the GUI canvas without network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence visual segment states; no external data flows or untrusted data processing occur.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward GUI widget implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code creates visual segments and manages their states based on character mappings. Polygon creation and segment mapping are standard. No external data reading, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code's purpose is purely graphical display, with internal state management and configuration updates. No signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of custom GUI components for a display, with no malicious or security concerns. All signals and scores reflect its safe, straightforward nature.",
