{
  "purpose": "Define custom graphical widgets for display elements in a Tkinter-based GUI, specifically segmented displays and blinking colons.",
  "sources": "Imports 'customtkinter' module, uses input parameters in class initializations and configuration methods, reads widget properties and state via 'cget' and 'itemcget' methods.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'create_polygon', 'itemconfig', and 'configure' methods to alter visual states of canvas items; no untrusted external data handling or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (colors, dimensions) flow into widget setup; 'setNumber' method sets segment states based on internal mappings; 'configure' updates widget properties and visual states accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious data handling; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines graphical components for display purposes, with no external data input, network communication, or credential handling. The 'createPolygon' function is used solely for drawing widget shapes, and state management relies on predefined mappings. The configuration methods update visual properties safely without executing external code or handling untrusted data. No indications of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom display widgets for a GUI, with no malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks identified.",
