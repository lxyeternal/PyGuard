{
  "purpose": "Define custom Tkinter-based GUI components for display elements, such as a seven-segment display and a blinking colon, using CustomTkinter.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters during initialization and configuration methods; it uses internal state variables and a mapping for segment activation.",
  "sinks": "It updates visual elements on the canvas based on internal logic; no external untrusted input handling or data transmission is evident.",
  "flows": "Initialization sets segment geometries and mappings; setNumber and setState methods update visual states based on segment mappings; configure methods update appearance dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or system harm routines are observed. The code relies solely on standard GUI drawing routines.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs visual GUI components for a display, with functions to change their states based on input. It uses straightforward methods to create and manage polygon shapes representing segments. There are no external data inputs, network communications, or system modifications. The structure is typical for custom widget creation in Python GUIs. No obfuscated or suspicious logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate GUI component implementation for display elements without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely for visual representation within a Python application.",
