  "anomalies": "Very minimal code; no anomalies detected; only version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a string representing version '0.1.0' to the variable __version__. There are no inputs, outputs, external interactions, or suspicious constructs. It does not perform any operations, network calls, or data handling that could be malicious. The simplicity suggests it is a standard version declaration snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, typical version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
