  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is simply assigning a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external interactions, or any complex logic.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that this is a minimal, benign version declaration.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The conclusion that this code is harmless is justified.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a version string assignment with no external interactions or complex logic, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The current scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware` = 0.\n   - No malicious activity is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThis code snippet is a standard, harmless version declaration. It does not pose any security risks or contain malicious intent.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** No changes needed. The current scores and analysis are appropriate.",
