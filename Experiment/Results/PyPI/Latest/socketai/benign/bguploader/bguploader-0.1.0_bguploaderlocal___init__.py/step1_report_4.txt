  "purpose": "Defines the version string for the module or package.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow pathways since there are no operations or data manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; only a version string assignment with no additional logic or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to a variable named __version__. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no function calls, or suspicious constructs. This is a standard practice in Python packages to indicate versioning and does not contain any malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and typical for Python package versioning. No malicious intent or security issues are present.",
