  "purpose": "Define the version of the Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string \"0.1.0\" to the variable __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process input, output, or external data.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or external interaction occurs.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a straightforward version declaration with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string to __version__, a common practice in Python packaging. It involves no inputs, outputs, external calls, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is justified.",
