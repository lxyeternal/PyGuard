  "purpose": "Define configuration parameters for an application, including API URL, allowed file extensions, and an API key.",
  "sources": "The hardcoded default_api_key and api_base_url variables within the Config class constructor.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of default_api_key and api_base_url in network requests or API calls, though not explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "The hardcoded api_base_url and default_api_key are used as sources; their values are likely used in network requests or API interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded API key in the source code, which can be a security risk if exposed or committed publicly. The API URL is also hardcoded, though less critical.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Config class with hardcoded configuration parameters, notably an API key and API URL. The API key is a sensitive credential embedded directly in the code, which can be exploited if the codebase is leaked or accessed by unauthorized users. The API URL is also fixed and local, which is typical for development environments, but the embedded key remains a concern. There is commented-out code for environment-based configuration, which indicates some awareness of different deployment contexts but does not mitigate the risk posed by hardcoded secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a security concern due to the hardcoded API key, which could be exploited if the code is shared or stored in version control. No malicious behavior or malware is detected. The overall security risk is moderate due to the exposure of sensitive credentials.",
