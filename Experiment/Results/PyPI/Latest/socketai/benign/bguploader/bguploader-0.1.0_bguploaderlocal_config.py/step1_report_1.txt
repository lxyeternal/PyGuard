{
  "purpose": "Define configuration settings for an application, including server URL, allowed file extensions, and an API key.",
  "sources": "The default_api_key is a hardcoded string within the class; self.server and self.api_base_url are set within the constructor; commented code suggests potential dynamic configuration.",
  "sinks": "The hardcoded API key could be used to access protected services; server URLs are local or development environments, unlikely malicious but potentially sensitive if exposed.",
  "flows": "The API key is statically assigned during class initialization; server URL is set based on the server attribute, with potential for dynamic configuration if the commented method were enabled.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded API key is a security concern; the API key is in plaintext, which is risky if code is exposed; commented code hints at configurable settings but currently inactive.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a configuration class with static values, including an API key, server URL, and allowed extensions. The hardcoded API key is a security risk if the code is shared or publicly accessible. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors is present. The commented setup method suggests plans for dynamic configuration, but currently, the configuration is static. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are found. Overall, the code appears to be standard configuration code with a notable security concern due to the hardcoded API key.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a hardcoded API key, which is a security vulnerability. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The code serves its purpose as a configuration setup but should avoid storing secrets in plaintext within source code.",
