  "purpose": "Configuration class defining server settings, allowed file extensions, and an API key for the application.",
  "sources": "Constants for API URL, allowed extensions, and API key; class initialization setting these parameters.",
  "sinks": "Usage of default_api_key, which could be sensitive; setting of api_base_url and default_api_key during class instantiation.",
  "flows": "Initialization of Config object leads to setting server parameters and API key, with potential usage elsewhere in the application.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hard-coded API key within the code; commented-out code suggests potential configuration flexibility, but the key remains exposed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Config class with hardcoded sensitive information, specifically an API key stored directly in the source code. The API URL and allowed extensions are typical configuration parameters. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity is present. The API key is potentially a security concern as it is visible in the code, which could lead to unauthorized access if exposed. The commented-out setup method indicates plans for environment-based configuration but does not mitigate the exposure of the hardcoded key.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hardcoded API key, which poses a security risk if the code is publicly accessible or improperly secured. No malicious behavior or malware is evident, but the exposed credentials are a security concern. The rest of the code appears standard for configuration purposes.",
