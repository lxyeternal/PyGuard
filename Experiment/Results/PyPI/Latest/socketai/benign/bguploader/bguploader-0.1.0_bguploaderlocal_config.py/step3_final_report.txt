  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python configuration code highlighting security concerns related to hardcoded secrets.",
  "sources": "The static 'default_api_key' string in the Config class.",
  "sinks": "Potential misuse if the API key is exposed or shared publicly.",
  "flows": "The API key is directly assigned during class initialization; no dynamic or external input flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded API key and URLs; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration class with static values, including a hardcoded API key. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware is evident. The main security concern is the exposure risk of the embedded secret. The code does not perform any network activity or contain malicious payloads. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.6) are consistent with the findings. The high confidence score (around 0.8) reflects certainty about the absence of malicious intent but acknowledges the security vulnerability due to secrets exposure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration snippet with a notable security flaw—hardcoded API credentials—but no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are appropriate, emphasizing the need to remove secrets from source code. Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent.",
