  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code snippet, and evaluate the accuracy of their assessments, scores, and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward configuration class with static values.\n- The `default_api_key` is hardcoded as a plaintext string, which is a security concern.\n- No obfuscated or malicious code is present.\n- Commented code suggests plans for dynamic configuration, but currently inactive.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.\n- The server URLs are local or development environments, unlikely malicious but sensitive if exposed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n**Purpose:** Define configuration settings, including server URL, API key.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the hardcoded API key as a security risk. No malicious intent or behavior is found.\n\n**Scores:**\n- malware: 0 (correct)\n- obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- securityRisk: 0.3 (moderate risk due to secret exposure; reasonable)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n**Purpose:** Similar to above, with emphasis on security concern due to hardcoded API key and URL.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes the security risk of embedded secrets. No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Scores:**\n- malware: 0 (correct)\n- obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- securityRisk: 0.6 (moderate to high; considering the exposure of secrets, this is reasonable)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n**Purpose:** Similar configuration class with a hardcoded API key.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states that the hardcoded API key is a security concern but not malicious.\n\n**Scores:**\n- malware: 0 (correct)\n- obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- securityRisk: 0.3 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n**Purpose:** Same as above, with focus on security risk due to embedded secrets.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly highlights the security implications of hardcoded API key and URL. No malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**\n- malware: 0 (correct)\n- obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- securityRisk: 0.6 (reasonable considering the exposure)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n**Purpose:** Same as above, noting the security risk.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly points out the security concern with hardcoded secrets, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**\n- malware: 0 (correct)\n- obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- securityRisk: 0.6 (reasonable)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** Slight variations (0.3 vs 0.6) are reasonable, given the severity of hardcoded secrets.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0**, as no malicious code is present.\n- The **obfuscated score** should remain at **0**.\n- The **security risk score** could be slightly increased to **0.7** or **0.8** considering the exposure of sensitive credentials, especially if the code is stored in version control or publicly accessible repositories.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.7 (due to hardcoded secrets, which is a significant security concern)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. The main concern is the hardcoded API key, which should be refactored into environment variables or secure storage to mitigate security risks. No malicious or obfuscated code is detected.",
