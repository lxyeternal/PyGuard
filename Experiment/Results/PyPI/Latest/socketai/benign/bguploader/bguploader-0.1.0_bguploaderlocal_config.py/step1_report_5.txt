  "purpose": "Define configuration settings for a web application, including API URL, allowed file extensions, logging, and API keys.",
  "sources": "The default_api_key variable contains a hardcoded API key; the api_base_url is set directly in the code.",
  "sinks": "The api_base_url and default_api_key could potentially be used for unauthorized access or data exfiltration if misused.",
  "flows": "The hardcoded api_base_url and default_api_key are set at initialization and could be used directly in network requests or authentication flows.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded API key, which is a security risk; commented out configuration code suggests potential future dynamic setup but is inactive.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Config class initializing with fixed server URL and a hardcoded API key, which is a security concern. The API key is stored plainly in the code, exposing sensitive credentials. The API URL is also hardcoded. Commented out code hints at intended dynamic configuration based on environment, but currently inactive. No malicious code, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The static credentials could be exploited if the code is compromised or shared publicly.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains hardcoded sensitive information (API key and URLs), which poses a security risk but no malicious behavior or malware. It is advisable to remove hardcoded secrets and implement secure environment-based configuration.",
