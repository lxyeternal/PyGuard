  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code uploads files via HTTP, handles responses, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Key points:** No obfuscation, malware score 0, security risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The code uses open() without context managers, which is a resource leak concern but not malicious. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent. The API key handling appears standard. The response validation is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** The malware score of 0 is justified. The security risk is low, given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors. The confidence level is high.\n- **Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, with detailed analysis indicating standard file upload functionality.\n- **Key points:** No obfuscation, malware score 0, security risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, resource management could be improved, but no malicious activity. API keys are passed as parameters, which is typical.\n- **Verdict:** Malware score remains appropriate at 0.\n- **Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard file upload code, validation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Key points:** No obfuscation, malware score 0, security risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Similar reasoning; no signs of malicious activity. The open() calls are a concern but not malicious.\n- **Verdict:** Malware score remains appropriate.\n- **Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern, standard upload utility.\n- **Key points:** No obfuscation, malware score 0, security risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity detected. API key handling via external Config() is typical.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n- **Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar assessment, standard file upload code.\n- **Key points:** No obfuscation, malware score 0, security risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, resource management could be improved but not malicious.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports have malware scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis. The code does not perform any malicious activity—no code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Set at 0.2, which seems to reflect minor resource management issues and standard API handling, not actual security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code functions as a legitimate file uploader utility.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- The resource leaks due to missing context managers are not malicious but should be improved.\n- The API key handling is standard, relying on external configuration.\n- The response handling is robust, with appropriate error checking.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (minor resource management issues, but not security vulnerabilities)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent with the code's actual behavior. The scores are reasonable and justified based on the code review. No adjustments are necessary.",
