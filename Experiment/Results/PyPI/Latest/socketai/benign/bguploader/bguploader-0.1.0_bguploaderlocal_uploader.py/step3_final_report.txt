{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to upload files (including XML files) to a specified API endpoint, handling validation, request construction, and response processing.",
  "sources": "File paths provided as function parameters, environment variables for API keys via Config(), and input data from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests made via requests.post or requests.get, and file reads via open() without context managers.",
  "flows": "Input data from filesystem and parameters flow into request construction, leading to HTTP requests and response handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without context managers which can cause resource leaks; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file validation, constructs API requests with appropriate headers, and handles responses with error checking. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is evident. The open() calls lack context managers, which is a minor resource leak concern but not malicious. API keys are handled via parameters or configuration, with no hardcoded secrets. Response parsing and validation are standard. Overall, the code appears legitimate and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical file upload utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor resource management issue does not impact security. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk score at 0.2 reflects minor resource handling concerns but no significant vulnerabilities.",
