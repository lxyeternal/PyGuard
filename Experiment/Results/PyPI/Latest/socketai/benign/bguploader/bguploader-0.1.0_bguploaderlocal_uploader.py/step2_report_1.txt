  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, code is straightforward for uploading files via API. Uses open() without context managers, which is a resource leak but not malicious. No obfuscation, secrets are handled via parameters and configuration.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate file upload utility, no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on API key handling and resource management concerns. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard implementation, low security risk.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—file uploads, validation, no malicious activity, resource leaks possible but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 fit.\n- **Conclusion:** Typical upload code, safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to above, with focus on request construction and API key management. No malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate functionality.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as previous, standard upload pattern, no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 fit.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity. The code is mainly about file uploads, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.2) due to resource leaks and handling of sensitive data (API keys), but these are common and not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The malware score should remain at **0**.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at **0**.\n- The risk score could be marginally increased if desired, but 0.2 remains appropriate given the resource management issues.\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to resource leaks and API key handling, but no malicious intent)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, legitimate utility for uploading files via API. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The minor resource management issues do not elevate the security risk to a concerning level.",
