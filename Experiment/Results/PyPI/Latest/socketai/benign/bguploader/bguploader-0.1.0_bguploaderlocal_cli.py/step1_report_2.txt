  "purpose": "The script facilitates uploading XML files to a specified API endpoint, supporting both individual files and entire folders, with configurable server environments and authentication credentials.",
  "sources": "Input parameters from command-line arguments: 'path', 'api_key', 'team_id', 'project_id', 'testrun_id', and 'server'.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to API URLs constructed based on the 'server' parameter; the functions 'upload_file' and 'upload_xml_files_from_folder' likely perform network operations with these URLs and data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to determine file locations and API endpoints; these are passed to upload functions which likely transmit data over the network, potentially including sensitive credentials.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets present; the code dynamically sets API URLs based on user input, but this is standard configuration behavior; no unusual code constructs or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles command-line inputs, configures API URLs based on user selection, and calls external upload functions with user-supplied parameters. The API key and other identifiers are accepted as arguments, which could pose security risks if misused, but in itself is not malicious. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious logic such as data exfiltration or system manipulation are present. The flow appears to be a straightforward upload utility with configurable server environments. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent in this code segment. The only potential concern is the handling of sensitive credentials passed as command-line arguments, which could be captured in process lists or logs if not handled securely, but this is a common pattern in CLI tools rather than malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard command-line utility for uploading files to configured API endpoints. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior based on static analysis. The primary security concern relates to handling credentials via command-line arguments, which is typical but should be managed carefully to prevent leaks.",
