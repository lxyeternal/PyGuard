  "purpose": "A CLI utility to upload a single XML file or all XML files in a folder to a specified API endpoint, configured via command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for file/folder path, API key, team ID, project ID, testrun ID, and server choice; external functions 'upload_file' and 'upload_xml_files_from_folder' handling uploads.",
  "sinks": "External upload functions executing network requests; no direct sinks in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "User provides path and credentials -> code determines file or directory -> calls external upload functions with provided data -> upload functions perform network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward logic, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI file uploader with parameter validation, dynamic API URL configuration based on server choice, and delegation to external upload functions. No malicious or suspicious constructs are present. Credentials are passed via command-line arguments, which is typical but should be managed securely. External functions' security depends on their implementation, but within this code, no issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, legitimate utility for uploading XML files, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to credential handling via CLI, which is common practice. The assigned scores are consistent with this analysis.",
