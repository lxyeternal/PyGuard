      "conclusion": "The package setup script is benign and free of malicious code or obfuscation. The primary concern is the suspicious contact info, which could be used for social engineering but does not impact code security. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly set to 0, and the risk score should be low (~0.2)."

      "conclusion": "The reports' scores are mostly consistent with their analyses. The primary concern lies with obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting a malware score around 0.5–0.6 and a security risk score around 0.5–0.6. Benign reports are correctly scored as low risk. Slightly increasing the malware and risk scores for reports with unsafe functions would improve accuracy."

      "conclusion": "The code is a simple substitution cipher with a suspicious call to an external function RRUU() whose behavior is unknown. No malicious activity is evident from the code itself, but the external call introduces uncertainty. The malware score should be low, but the security risk warrants attention. Further investigation of RRUU() is recommended to confirm its behavior."
