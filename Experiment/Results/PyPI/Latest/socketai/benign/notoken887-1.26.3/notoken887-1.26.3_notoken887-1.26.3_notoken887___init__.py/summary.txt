  "conclusion": "The reports' scores are mostly consistent with their analyses. The primary concern lies with obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting a malware score around 0.5–0.6 and a security risk score around 0.5–0.6. Benign reports are correctly scored as low risk. Slightly increasing the malware and risk scores for reports with unsafe functions would improve accuracy."
