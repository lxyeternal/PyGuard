  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Package metadata fields such as name, version, author, description, url, classifiers, and python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the script only defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The author email 'hitler@gmail.com' is suspicious and unprofessional; the URL points to a non-standard domain 'https://thugging.org'. The description mentions 'obfuscation test lib,' which may suggest obfuscation or testing purposes, but no actual obfuscation code is present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata, which is standard. The author email and URL are unusual but not malicious in themselves. There are no signs of code injection, malicious behavior, or suspicious data handling. The reference to 'obfuscation test lib' suggests it might be used for testing obfuscation techniques, but no such code is present here. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard package setup conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration with some suspicious contact info but no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It appears to be a benign package setup script, possibly used for testing obfuscation, but contains no active malicious code or security risks.",
