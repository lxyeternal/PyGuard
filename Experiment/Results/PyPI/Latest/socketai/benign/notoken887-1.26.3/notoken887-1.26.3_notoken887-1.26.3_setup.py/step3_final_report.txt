  "purpose": "Configure package setup with metadata for 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static metadata fields in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org') as metadata anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setuptools setup script defining package metadata. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The only notable anomalies are the unprofessional author email and URL, which are suspicious but do not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as no malicious code exists. The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the static, clear code. The security risk score varies from 0.1 to 0.6 across reports, primarily reflecting suspicion based on metadata rather than active threats. Given the absence of malicious behavior, a low risk score (~0.2) is appropriate. Overall, the code is benign, with metadata concerns that warrant caution but do not constitute security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup script is benign and free of malicious code or obfuscation. The primary concern is the suspicious contact info, which could be used for social engineering but does not impact code security. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly set to 0, and the risk score should be low (~0.2).",
