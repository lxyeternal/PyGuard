{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple character substitution-based encoding and decoding functions, ostensibly for token obfuscation or encoding.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings for encryption and encrypted tokens for decryption in the methods 'encrypt' and 'decrypt'.",
  "sinks": "The functions perform string replacements; no external systems, files, network, or environment variables are accessed or modified.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed through a series of replace calls, with the encrypt method replacing characters with emojis and symbols, and decrypt reversing this process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code employs straightforward character replacement without complex logic or obfuscation techniques. It neither reads from nor writes to external data sources or executes dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a token encoding scheme based on character substitutions using emojis and special characters. Both methods perform direct replace operations, replacing specific characters with emojis in 'encrypt' and reversing these substitutions in 'decrypt'. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, network activity, or obfuscated behavior. The functions are simple and deterministic, serving solely for encoding/decoding purposes. No suspicious behavior, malware patterns, or security risks are present within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward character substitution cipher used for token obfuscation. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation is clear and not obfuscated. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
