{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings using emojis as tokens.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the encrypt() and decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "Returns of the methods; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through chained replace() calls to produce encoded or decoded strings.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely performs straightforward string replacements for encoding and decoding; no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The class TokenCryptor performs symmetric substitution cipher transformations on input strings, replacing characters with emojis and vice versa. It contains no external data reads, network activity, or execution of arbitrary code. The replacement logic is static and consistent, indicating no obfuscation or malicious intent. There are no suspicious patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be a simple encoding/decoding utility with no security risks or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static substitution cipher implementation for encoding and decoding strings with emojis. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malware features.",
