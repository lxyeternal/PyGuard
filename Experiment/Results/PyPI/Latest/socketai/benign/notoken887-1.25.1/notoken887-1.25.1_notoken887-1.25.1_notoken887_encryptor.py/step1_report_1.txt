{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple encoding and decoding of strings by substituting characters with emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "The methods read input strings to be encrypted or decrypted.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks related to untrusted data processing, network, or file system operations.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed character-by-character through replace operations in encrypt() and decrypt() methods.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs extensive character replacement but contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple substitution cipher using emojis for characters. Both methods perform static, character-based replacements without external inputs, network interactions, or dynamic execution. No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The logic is straightforward, and the code appears to serve a benign purpose of encoding and decoding data using emojis.",
  "conclusion": "The class implements a basic character substitution cipher with emoji mappings, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign utility for obfuscating strings, not intended for malicious purposes.",
