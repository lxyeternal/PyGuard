{
  "purpose": "A simple substitution cipher encoding and decoding emojis and symbols for characters and digits.",
  "sources": "Input strings to encrypt or encrypted tokens to decrypt, via method parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform external data access, network communication, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input string passes through chained replace calls to produce encrypted output; encrypted token undergoes chained replace calls to decrypt.",
  "anomalies": "Use of chained replace calls for static character substitution; superficial obfuscation via emojis and symbols; no malicious code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a static substitution cipher with emoji and symbol mappings for alphanumeric characters and punctuation. Both encrypt and decrypt methods perform deterministic chained replacements, with no external dependencies, network activity, or system modifications. The substitution is superficial, serving as obfuscation rather than security. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage are present. The code's structure is straightforward, and the purpose appears to be playful encoding or obfuscation. The minimal obfuscation score (around 0.1) is justified by the emoji substitutions, but this does not indicate malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static substitution cipher utility used for playful obfuscation. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
