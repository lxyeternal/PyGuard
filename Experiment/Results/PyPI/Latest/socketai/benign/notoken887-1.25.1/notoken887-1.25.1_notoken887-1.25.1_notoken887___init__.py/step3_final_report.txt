  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input reading points such as environment variables, user input, files, network sockets, and potential use of functions like eval(), exec(), pickle, or other system interactions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, system modifications, network transmissions, or execution of insecure functions that could lead to security breaches or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks (e.g., eval(), network calls, file writes), indicating possible security issues if untrusted data is involved.",
  "anomalies": "Any use of insecure functions (eval(), exec(), pickle), hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow patterns that deviate from typical benign scripts.",
  "analysis": "All five reports consistently assess the code as benign, straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) align with the descriptions. The security risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.3), justified by the absence of concrete insecure functions or obfuscation. Report 3's risk score of 0.3 could be slightly lowered to 0.2 given no explicit insecure functions are confirmed. Confidence levels are high (0.7 to 0.9), reflecting trust in the summaries. Without actual code snippets, these conclusions are based on the provided descriptions, which appear consistent and reasonable.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed are benign, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are appropriate; minor adjustments to risk scores for Report 3 could be considered if further code details reveal no insecure functions. Overall, the assessments are justified and consistent.",
