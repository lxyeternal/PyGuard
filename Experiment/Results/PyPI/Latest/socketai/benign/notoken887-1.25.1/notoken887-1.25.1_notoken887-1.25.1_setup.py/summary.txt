  "conclusion": "The package content is benign and standard; the main concern is the suspicious contact details, which do not constitute a code-based threat but could impact reputation or trust if distributed. Scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are zero, with a low security risk primarily due to metadata. No code-based security issues are present."
