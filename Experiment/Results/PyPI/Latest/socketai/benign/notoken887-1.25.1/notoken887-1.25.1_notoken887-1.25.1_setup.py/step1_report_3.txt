  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'notoken887' for distribution.",
  "sources": "User input data such as package name, version, author details, description, URL, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no code execution or data leakage points identified.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from sources to sinks; the script only contains a static setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The author email 'hitler@gmail.com' is suspicious and unprofessional, but this is not inherently malicious code. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It contains no code execution, input handling, or network activity. The suspicious element is the email address, which may indicate malicious intent or poor judgment, but this does not constitute malicious code or behavior. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks within this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with an unusual email address. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present in the code itself. The primary concern is the professionalism of contact details, not security.",
