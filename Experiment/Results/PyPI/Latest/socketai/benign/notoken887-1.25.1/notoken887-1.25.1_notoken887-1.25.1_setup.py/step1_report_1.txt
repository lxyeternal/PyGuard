  "purpose": "Configure the package setup for distribution of the 'notoken887' Python library.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources; static setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling operations; purely package configuration.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "Use of suspicious email address ('hitler@gmail.com') and domain ('thugging.org') which could be considered malicious or untrustworthy; no other unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup configuration defining package metadata. The email and URL provided are suspicious and potentially malicious or inappropriate. The code does not include any dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. The package content appears benign in structure, but the metadata raises concern about intent or association with malicious content. No sources or sinks indicative of malicious activity are present within the setup script itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with suspicious metadata. No malicious behavior or malware is present in the code structure itself, but the choice of author email and URL warrants caution. Overall, no malicious intent is evident in the setup logic, but metadata raises concern.",
