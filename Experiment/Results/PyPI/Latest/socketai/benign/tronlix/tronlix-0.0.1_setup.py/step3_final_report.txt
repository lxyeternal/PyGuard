  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python library named 'tronlix'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; uses 'setuptools' functions for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data leakage points present.",
  "flows": "Reads local file for description; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Placeholder URL in 'project_urls'—not malicious, but a minor incomplete detail.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. It performs standard package configuration tasks, with no handling of untrusted input or network activity. The scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The placeholder URL is noted but not considered malicious. Overall, the code is safe, and the reports accurately reflect this.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified. No further action or concern is necessary.",
