{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function or variable named 'perm' from a local module called 'main'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the local 'main' module file.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or processing is shown beyond the import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs an import from a relative module, which is standard in Python projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The snippet alone does not provide any malicious intent or suspicious patterns; it merely imports a component.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and typical of modular Python code. However, without additional context or the content of 'main', a comprehensive security assessment is limited.",
