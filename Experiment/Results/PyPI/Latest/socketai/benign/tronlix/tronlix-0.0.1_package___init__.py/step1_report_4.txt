  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only a single import statement. No suspicious or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports an object or function named 'perm' from a relative module 'main'. There are no apparent security issues, malicious behaviors, or obfuscated code. The import statement itself is standard in Python projects. Without additional context or further code, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security concerns. It appears to be a standard part of a larger codebase.",
