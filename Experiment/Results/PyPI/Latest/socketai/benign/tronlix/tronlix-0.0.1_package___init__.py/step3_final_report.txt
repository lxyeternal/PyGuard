{
  "purpose": "Minimal import statement, likely part of a larger package structure.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself (`from .main import perm`). No data input or external sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only performs an import with no data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code imports a module component but does not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement, standard in Python packages. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The minimal scope limits the potential for malicious activity. Scores for malware and obfuscation are 0, and risk scores are very low (~0.1), reflecting negligible threat. Confidence in benign assessment is high (close to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
