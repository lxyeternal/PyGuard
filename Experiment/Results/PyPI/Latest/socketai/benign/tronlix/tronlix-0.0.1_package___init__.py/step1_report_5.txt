  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local 'main' module.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.main'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external communication is visible.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with a single import statement; no data from sources is being processed or output.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no additional logic. The use of a relative import is common in package modules but does not inherently indicate malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "This code imports 'perm' from a sibling module 'main'. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. It is a simple import statement. Since it does not perform any operations, data processing, or communication, it poses no apparent security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal part of a larger module. No suspicious activity or anomalies are present.",
