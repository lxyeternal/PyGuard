  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code presence and correctness**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of a simple import statement: `from .main import perm` or similar.\n   - No additional code, data flows, or logic are provided.\n   - The import statements are syntactically correct and standard in Python projects.\n\n2. **Potential issues or anomalies**:\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious constructs, or hardcoded secrets.\n   - The minimal code limits the scope for malicious activity.\n   - Relative imports are common in package structures; no suspicious patterns are observed.\n\n3. **Scores assessment**:\n   - **Obfuscated score**: consistently 0 across reports, appropriate given the simplicity.\n   - **Malware score**: all reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Security risk**: mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which seems reasonable given the limited code scope.\n   - **Confidence levels**: mostly high (0.9 or 1), reflecting confidence that the code is benign.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores**:\n   - Since the code is just an import statement with no further context, the risk is minimal.\n   - No signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present.\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n5. **Claims about vulnerabilities**:\n   - All reports correctly avoid assuming vulnerabilities solely based on import statements.\n   - No unwarranted claims or assumptions are made.\n\n6. **Overall assessment**:\n   - The code snippet is benign.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n   - No further action or suspicion is warranted based on this fragment.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary**:\nThis is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
