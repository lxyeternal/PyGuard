  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the consistency of scores, and the validity of conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports are based solely on a single import statement: `from .main import perm` or similar.\n- No additional code, data flows, or behaviors are provided.\n- The import statements are standard Python practices, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the issues:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify the code as a simple import statement.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity is observed in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None of the reports detect obfuscation; all scores reflect this.\n- **Security risk:** Given the minimal code, no security risks are evident.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly note the lack of data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n- The only potential concern could be the use of relative imports (`from .main`), which might be misused in some contexts, but in isolation, it's standard practice.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Malware score:** All are zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are zero, which aligns with the simplicity of the code.\n- **Risk score:** Most are 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal or no risk, which is justified given the code snippet.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign such scores, and based on the evidence, none are warranted.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the minimal nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 for all reports — correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all reports — correct.\n- **Risk:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable.\n\n### My overall estimate:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code snippet, I would assign:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to account for the minimal import activity, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns well with the code snippet. No further action or concern is warranted based on this isolated import statement.",
