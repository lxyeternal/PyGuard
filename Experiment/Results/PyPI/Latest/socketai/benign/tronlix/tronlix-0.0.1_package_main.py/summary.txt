  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk behavior by transmitting private keys externally without safeguards, indicating potential malicious exfiltration. Syntax issues suggest poor coding or obfuscation. The high malware and security risk scores are justified given the privacy implications. Overall, the code should be considered highly suspicious and potentially malicious."
