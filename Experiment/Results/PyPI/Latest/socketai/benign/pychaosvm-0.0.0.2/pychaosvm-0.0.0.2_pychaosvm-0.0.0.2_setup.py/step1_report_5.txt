  "purpose": "Define and configure the metadata for a Python package named 'pychaosvm'.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call which provides package information such as name, version, author, description, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no code execution or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Input is static data provided to the setup() function; no data flows from external sources or user input.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields are unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with static package metadata. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The package appears to be a placeholder with minimal information and no functional logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign placeholder package definition.",
