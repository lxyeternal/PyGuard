  "purpose": "A minimal setup script defining package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters: name, version, author, author_email, description, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input processing.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, static, and free of suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools with static metadata. It contains no dynamic code, external input handling, or executable logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The description 'A security place-holder package' indicates a placeholder, not malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code content. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package configuration script with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and static nature.",
