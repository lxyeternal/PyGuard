{
  "purpose": "This code provides a set of plotting utilities for visualizing data related to signal processing, machine learning, and communications systems, including scatter plots, PDFs, constellation diagrams, channel matrices, and performance metrics.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters such as dataframes, numpy arrays, and dictionaries; reads environment variables indirectly through os module (used for directory creation).",
  "sinks": "Saves figures as PDF files; no untrusted data output or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into plotting functions, which generate visualizations saved to specified directories. No data flows directly from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; no network communication or external system modification observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code uses standard libraries and methods for visualization without obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured collection of plotting methods using matplotlib, numpy, pandas, and os. It handles visualization tasks with proper parameterization, including saving figures to specified output paths. No signs of malicious activity such as code injection, network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The os module is used solely for directory creation, which is benign in this context. The code does not contain any obfuscated parts, dynamic execution, or suspicious variable names. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate data visualization utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign plotting utility module intended for visualizing various signal and performance metrics. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
