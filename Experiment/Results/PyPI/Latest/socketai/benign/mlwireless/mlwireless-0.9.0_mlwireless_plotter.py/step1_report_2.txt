{
  "purpose": "This code provides a set of visualization and plotting utilities for data analysis, specifically related to signal processing, channel modeling, and machine learning performance metrics.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters such as dataframes, numpy arrays, or signal arrays passed to the plotting functions.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output files as PDF images in specified output directories; no data leakage or untrusted data processing is evident. No network or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables (dataframes, numpy arrays) through processing steps like grouping, histogramming, or plotting commands, culminating in saving figures to files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are observed. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. Use of matplotlib, numpy, pandas, and os is standard for plotting and file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard visualization utility class for plotting various data types, including scatter plots, performance metrics, PDFs, constellation diagrams, channel responses, IQ diagrams, neural network training histories, Q-learning performances, environment measurements, and agent actions. It includes safe file handling, directory creation, and clear plotting logic. No external network calls, code injections, or obfuscated code are present. The code's logic and structure are straightforward and typical of data visualization modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, designed for data visualization purposes. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. It appears to be a legitimate utility module for signal and machine learning data analysis.",
