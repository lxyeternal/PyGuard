{
  "purpose": "The code implements a comprehensive wireless communication simulation environment, including channel modeling, modulation schemes, ML detection, and visualization tools, primarily aimed at research and educational purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input bits, payload files, and image files for visualization; loads pre-trained ML models; generates channel matrices and interference signals internally.",
  "sinks": "No network transmission, data exfiltration, or external communication; all data flows are local within the process, involving file I/O and in-memory computations.",
  "flows": "Input data (bits, images, models) are processed through encoding, modulation, channel effects, ML detection, and visualization functions; no external data is transmitted outside the local environment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; functions are standard utilities for visualization and simulation; no obfuscation or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, multi-purpose wireless simulation toolkit with ML detection components. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no network calls or hidden code. The file reading functions are typical for visualization, not malicious. External models are loaded from disk, which is standard in ML workflows. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The overall design and functions align with research-grade simulation tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, research-oriented wireless communication simulation and ML detection framework. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and security risk score around 0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
