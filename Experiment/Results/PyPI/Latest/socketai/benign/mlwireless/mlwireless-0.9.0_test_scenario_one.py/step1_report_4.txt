{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to simulate a wireless communication system with multiple antennas, channel effects, precoding, channel estimation, and performance evaluation metrics such as BER and BLER, likely for research or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include payload files ('faris.bmp'), environment variables (e.g., CUDA device settings), and predefined parameters such as SNR values. Data flows through functions generating symbols, channel effects, interference, and channel estimates.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially flow into plotting functions (plotting constellation and performance metrics) or be written to CSV files. No direct network communication or data exfiltration routines are present. Sensitive parameters (e.g., payload files) are read locally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from payload generation or loading to modulation, through channel simulation, estimation, and equalization processes, culminating in performance metrics calculation and visualization. No suspicious data flow paths or external data exfiltration detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code segments such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Environment variables are used for GPU configuration, which is standard. No dynamic code execution or misleading variable names are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs simulation steps with clear modular function calls and standard data processing routines. All data handling appears consistent with simulation workflows. No external network activity, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. Usage of third-party libraries (pandas, numpy, tensorflow, matplotlib) is appropriate for the task. The code is well-structured for its purpose, with no signs of sabotage, malicious payloads, or privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate wireless system simulation tool with no malicious intent or harmful behavior detected. It strictly performs computational modeling and data visualization related to wireless communication metrics.",
