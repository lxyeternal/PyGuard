  "purpose": "The code simulates a wireless communication system involving channel effects, precoding, equalization, and performance evaluation for different SNR levels, with plotting and data logging features.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER, CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES), payload file ('faris.bmp'), user input via command line (implicitly through environment), and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs such as CSV files ('simulation_detailed_data.csv', 'simulation_data.csv'), plot files, and console logs.",
  "flows": "Environment variables set -> Payload file read -> Simulation parameters set -> Channel and system matrices generated -> Data transmitted, received, and processed through multiple stages (precoding, channel effects, estimation, equalization) -> Performance metrics computed -> Results stored in dataframes and exported.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Environment variable manipulations for CUDA are standard for GPU utilization. Payload is an image file, with no signs of malicious file handling or decryption. Plotting functions and CSV outputs do not contain embedded malicious code. Usage of imported modules appears standard and relevant to the simulation purpose. No hidden or obfuscated code elements observed.",
  "analysis": "The script sets environment variables for GPU configuration, loads common scientific and machine learning libraries, and custom modules ('mlwireless', 'plotter'). It then initializes parameters for a wireless communication simulation, including channel, antenna, modulation, and SNR settings. The code generates and transmits signals, performs channel estimation, compression, equalization, detection, and plots results. Data is logged into dataframes and exported as CSV. Throughout, no suspicious functions, dynamic code execution, external network connections, or data exfiltration activities are present. All modules and operations appear relevant to a legitimate simulation task, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a comprehensive wireless communication simulation for research or analysis purposes. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The operations are consistent with standard simulation workflows, with no suspicious or harmful actions detected.",
