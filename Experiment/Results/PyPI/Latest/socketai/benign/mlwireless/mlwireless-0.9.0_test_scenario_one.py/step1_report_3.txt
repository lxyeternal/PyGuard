{
  "purpose": "The code appears to simulate wireless communication systems, including channel modeling, precoding, channel estimation, and performance evaluation for various modulation schemes and SNR levels.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from files (payload BMP image), environment variables, and external modules; generates random symbols and channel states.",
  "sinks": "Outputs plots, CSV files with simulation data, and potentially sensitive information such as payloads and error metrics.",
  "flows": "Input data (payload and parameters) -> channel modeling and signal processing -> channel estimation and quantization -> symbol detection -> performance metrics output to CSV and plots.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks detected. Use of environment variables for GPU selection is standard. No code segments perform malicious actions or attempt to access sensitive data outside the simulation context.",
  "analysis": "The code is a complex simulation framework for wireless communication performance analysis. It involves multiple signal processing steps, including channel modeling, precoding, channel estimation, quantization, and detection. The environment variable manipulation is for GPU configuration, typical for high-performance computing tasks. Data outputs include CSV logs and plots. No obfuscated code, external network communication, or suspicious file handling was detected. The code does not perform any actions that could harm or compromise the host system or extract data illicitly.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a simulation tool for wireless communication systems. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, nor does it contain suspicious or harmful code segments. All operations pertain to performance evaluation and visualization within a controlled environment.",
