  "purpose": "Minimal boilerplate code defining a version string and importing a standard library module.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'importlib'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static code with no dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static snippet with a license comment, a version string, and an import of the standard library 'importlib'. There are no data inputs, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The import is from the standard library and is harmless in this context. No anomalies or obfuscation are present. The code is typical boilerplate for a Python package initialization or setup.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal import of 'importlib' does not pose any threat, and the code structure is straightforward.",
