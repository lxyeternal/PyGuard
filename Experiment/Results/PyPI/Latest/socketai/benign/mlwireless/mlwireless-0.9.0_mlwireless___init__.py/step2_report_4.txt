  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their conclusions with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Contains only a copyright comment, a version string (`__version__ = \"0.9.0\"`), and an import statement (`import importlib`).\n- No data flow, no user input, no network activity, no dynamic code execution.\n- The imported module (`importlib`) is a standard Python library used for dynamic imports but is harmless in this context.\n- The code appears to be boilerplate or part of a larger package setup.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly states the code's purpose.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No untrusted data sources or sinks, no data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; code is benign, minimal, and standard.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Confidence: 1 (justified)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)\n  - Malware: 0 (no malicious activity)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 (no risks)\n  \n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, accurate.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No issues.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Confidence: 1 (justified)\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Malware: 0\n  - SecurityRisk: 0\n  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, accurate.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No issues.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; code is benign.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Confidence: 0.9 (slightly less, but still reasonable)\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Malware: 0\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 (very low, possibly due to the mention of importlib, but it's benign)\n  \n**Note:** The security risk score is marginally above zero, which seems reasonable given the import of a standard library. It doesn't indicate a real risk but is cautious.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No issues.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; standard boilerplate code.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Confidence: 1\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Malware: 0\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 (again, a minimal risk due to importlib, but no actual threat)\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No issues.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Confidence: 0.9\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Malware: 0\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; malware score should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; score should be 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's simplicity and benign nature, a risk score of around 0.0 to 0.1 is appropriate. The reports' scores of 0 or 0.1 are reasonable, considering the minimal risk associated with importing a standard library.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code does not contain any malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- The small security risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports is acceptable, given the import of `importlib`, but it should be kept at 0 unless further context suggests otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my estimates:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | **0**          |\n| Obfuscated     | **0**          |\n| Security Risk  | **0** or **0.05** (very minimal, but 0 is preferable) |\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0. The security risk score can be set to 0 unless additional context indicates otherwise.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and reasonable; no changes are necessary. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
