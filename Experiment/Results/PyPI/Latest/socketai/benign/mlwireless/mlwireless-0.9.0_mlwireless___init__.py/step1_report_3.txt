{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set a version string and import the importlib module, likely as part of a larger package or module initialization.",
  "sources": "The only source is the import of the importlib module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a copyright notice, a version assignment, and an import statement for the importlib module. No functions, no data handling, no user input, or network activities are present. The import of a standard library module does not indicate malicious intent. There is no suspicious or unusual activity or structure. The presence of only these simple statements suggests this is part of a larger, benign codebase.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited code provided, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward and appears benign.",
