  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is straightforward, with only a license comment, a version string, and an import statement for `importlib`. No data flow, no untrusted input, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate. Security risk is 0, justified given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same minimal code, standard import, no data flow or suspicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0.1, which is slightly above zero but justified as the code is very simple and unlikely to be malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same minimal code, no anomalies or suspicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0.1. Given the code's simplicity, this is acceptable, though the slight security risk score might be conservative.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, minimal setup code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0.0 or 0.1—here, it's 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same minimal code, standard import.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.1, which seems reasonable given the context.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores are 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in most reports, reflecting minimal concern for security risk in such boilerplate code, which is reasonable.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports' reasoning)\n\n**Additional note:** Given the code's simplicity and lack of any suspicious or malicious indicators, I would not increase the risk score further. The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, standard boilerplate.\n- Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1",
