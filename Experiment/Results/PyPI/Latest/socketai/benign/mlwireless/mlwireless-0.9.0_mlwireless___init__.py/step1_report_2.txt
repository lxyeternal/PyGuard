  "purpose": "The code appears to set a version string and import a module, likely as part of a larger package or script setup.",
  "sources": "The only source of data reading is the import statement, which loads the importlib module; no user input or external data is read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version attribute and imports a standard library module. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors. The importlib module is used for dynamic imports but is common in Python packages; there are no signs of malicious dynamic execution or other suspicious activities. The copyright statement is standard and does not contribute to security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, contains no malicious behavior or security risks, and serves a simple purpose of setting version info and importing a module. No threats or malicious indicators are present.",
