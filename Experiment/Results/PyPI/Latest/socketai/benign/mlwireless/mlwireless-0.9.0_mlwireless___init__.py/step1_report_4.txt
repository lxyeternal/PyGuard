{
  "purpose": "The code sets a version string and imports the importlib module, likely as part of a larger module or package initialization.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ string and imports the importlib module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. Importing importlib alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a copyright notice, defines a version string, and imports the importlib module. No input reading, no data processing, and no potentially malicious operations are present. The importlib import may be used elsewhere in the larger package but is harmless here. The snippet appears to be boilerplate setup code.",
  "conclusion": "There is no indication of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation in this minimal code fragment. It appears to be standard setup code with no security concerns.",
