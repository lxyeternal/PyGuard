{
  "purpose": "The code implements a comprehensive wireless communication simulation framework involving signal processing, machine learning models (CNN, LSTM, Autoencoder), and reinforcement learning algorithms, primarily for research and development purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from internal functions generating signals, channel models, and environment states; it does not read external untrusted inputs or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not send data over networks, write to external servers, or perform any data exfiltration; it mainly processes data internally and generates plots locally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from signal generation and channel simulation to ML model training and evaluation, then to plotting functions; no external untrusted data flows into or out of the system.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious routines are present; environment variables are set for GPU configuration, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured for scientific simulation involving data generation, ML training, and plotting. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious behavior, external network activity, or obfuscation. Environment variables for GPU setup are typical and not malicious. The functions perform legitimate data processing and model training tasks, consistent with research purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, research-oriented, and free from malicious activity or obfuscation. It poses minimal security risk, with scores accurately reflecting its benign nature.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
