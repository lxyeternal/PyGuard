{
  "purpose": "The code implements a reinforcement learning environment simulating radio signal management, specifically SINR and power control adjustments.",
  "sources": "Reads seed input for reproducibility, initializes environment parameters, resets state, and receives actions that modify power control settings.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include the environment's state, rewards, and termination signals. No untrusted external data outputs or network transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "Seed initialization -> reset() to set initial state -> step(action) to update environment state based on action -> compute_rf() modifies SINR based on power control.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; environment logic is straightforward. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard RL environment class with typical methods (init, seed, reset, step, internal rf computation). No external data leaks, network calls, or malicious behaviors. The environment models radio signal control with basic state updates and reward calculation. The code appears clean, well-structured, and consistent with RL environment practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It implements a legitimate RL environment for radio SINR and power control simulation. No suspicious or malicious code detected.",
