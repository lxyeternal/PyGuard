  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.core and .config)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data flows present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is merely importing and exporting class references",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard import and export statements, no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from local modules and declares __all__ for module exports. It does not process input data, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward module setup code with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign and standard for Python module packaging.",
