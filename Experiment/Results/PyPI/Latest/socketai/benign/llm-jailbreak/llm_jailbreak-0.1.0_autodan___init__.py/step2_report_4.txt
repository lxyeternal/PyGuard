  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**: All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward module export file, importing classes from local modules and exposing them via `__all__`. There are no signs of dynamic behavior, input handling, or external data processing.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies**: None of the reports detect anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code is minimal, standard, and does not perform any actions beyond module setup.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Data Flows**: No data flows from untrusted sources, no sinks, and no external input handling are present. The code simply re-exports classes, which is typical for an `__init__.py` or module interface file.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Obfuscated**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n   - **Malware**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **SecurityRisk**: All assign 0, which is justified since there's no security concern.\n\n5. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores**:\n   - The code is very basic and does not perform any operations that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n   - The presence of `__all__` and imports from local modules is standard and not risky.\n   - No signs of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n\n6. **Any claims based on assumptions?**:\n   - No. All reports are consistent and based on the actual code content.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks identified.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign module initialization file with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: Given the simplicity of the code, there's no reason to assign any higher scores. The overall security posture is very low risk.",
