{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization file, importing core classes and exposing them for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '.core' and '.config'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Import statements to module interface exposure; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static module setup with straightforward imports and exports. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident, and the high confidence scores are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module export pattern with no security issues or malicious intent. The reports accurately reflect this, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
