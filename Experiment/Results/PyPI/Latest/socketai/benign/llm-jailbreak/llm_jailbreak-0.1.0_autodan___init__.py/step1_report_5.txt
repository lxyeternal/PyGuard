  "purpose": "This code appears to define the module's public API by importing specific classes from internal modules.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules '.core' and '.config' to access 'AutoDAN' and 'AutoDANConfig' classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data; the code only performs static imports and exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code simply sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from local modules and defines the public API of the package. There are no input sources, data processing, or external communications. It is a typical module initialization snippet without any malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an API setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
