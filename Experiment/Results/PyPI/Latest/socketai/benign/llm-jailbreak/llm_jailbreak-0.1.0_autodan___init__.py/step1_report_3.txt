  "purpose": "This code defines exports for the autodan module, exposing AutoDAN and AutoDANConfig classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing core.AutoDAN and config.AutoDANConfig modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code only imports modules and defines __all__.",
  "flows": "Imports from local modules to the current namespace; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, importing classes from local modules and defining what is exported. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no input/output flows involving untrusted data, and no suspicious logic. It appears to be a typical module initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export setup with no malicious intent or security concerns identified. It simply makes specific classes available externally.",
