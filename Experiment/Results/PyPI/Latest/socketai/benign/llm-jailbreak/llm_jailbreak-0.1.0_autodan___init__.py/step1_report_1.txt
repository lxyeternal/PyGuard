{
  "purpose": "This module appears to define an autodan package that re-exports classes from core and config submodules, likely to provide a simplified interface for users.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module imports and the __all__ declaration; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; it does not handle or process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only imports and declares exports without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two components from relative modules and exposes them via __all__, serving as an interface or API layer. It does not execute any logic, handle input/output, or perform any actions that could be malicious. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py or module export file, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It serves as a simple interface for other parts of the package.",
