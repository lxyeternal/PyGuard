  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a simple module that imports classes from local modules (.core and .config) and re-exports them via `__all__`.\n- There are no signs of data processing, input handling, external communications, or dynamic code execution.\n- No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code structure is typical for a package's `__init__.py` or similar module export file.\n- All reports consistently conclude the code is benign and standard.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of malicious behavior:** None detected. The malware score is 0 in all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; obfuscated score is 0.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0.5 or below, reflecting minimal or no security concern.\n\n**Potential issues or flaws in the reports:**\n- The reports are very consistent and thorough; they correctly identify that the code is benign.\n- They do not consider the possibility of indirect malicious behavior if, for example, the imported modules (`.core`, `.config`) are compromised. However, based solely on this code snippet, such concerns are outside the scope.\n- The reports assume that the code is a simple API setup, which is accurate.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all correctly set to 0.\n- The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign, which is justified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed for the scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** While the code itself appears safe, always consider the security of the imported modules (`.core`, `.config`) in a full supply chain analysis. However, based solely on this snippet, there are no concerns.",
