  "purpose": "Define a configuration dataclass for the AutoDAN testing pipeline, including model paths, API keys, algorithm parameters, and test settings.",
  "sources": "Input data for model configuration, default values for model paths, API key, and test prefixes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to potential security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Initialization of configuration attributes, setting default model paths, HF model names, and test prefixes based on input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code performs standard configuration setup. No hardcoded credentials or hidden code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class with default parameters and dynamic initialization logic. It uses default directory paths, model names, and test prefixes. The api_key field is optional, and no direct use of this key is evident within the class. The setting of model paths and model names is straightforward, and no dynamic execution or obfuscation is present. No indications of malicious behavior or sabotage are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration class for managing model and test parameters with no malicious or security-risk elements detected. It is well-structured, with no suspicious patterns or hidden behaviors.",
