  "purpose": "Defines a configuration data structure for an AutoDAN testing pipeline, including model parameters, paths, and default values.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables and file paths (e.g., model_paths, dataset_path, init_prompt_path).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data directly; no network or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class initialization and default value assignments, with no dynamic code execution or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Usage of default file paths and model names appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a dataclass for configuration purposes, setting default paths, model names, and prefixes. It uses standard Python practices for default value setting and object initialization. No external input handling, network communication, or code execution based on external data is present. The 'api_key' field is optional, but there is no code that utilizes or exposes it maliciously. Overall, the code appears purely to establish configuration parameters without any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a configuration class with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated code, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms. The purpose is straightforward, related to setting up parameters for a testing pipeline.",
