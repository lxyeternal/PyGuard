{
  "purpose": "Defines a configuration class for the AutoDAN testing pipeline, including model, API, and dataset settings.",
  "sources": "Reads default model paths, model names, API keys (optional), dataset and prompt file paths, and test prefixes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data processing or external communication evident.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from class attributes and __post_init__ method into model setup and test execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data; no unusual code patterns or logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured data class for configuration purposes. It sets default paths and names, handles optional parameters, and initializes test prefixes. No user input is processed, and no network or file operations are performed within this code snippet. The only notable variable, 'api_key', is optional and not used internally here, reducing risk. No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a configuration holder without any malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks evident. It does not perform any harmful actions or external communications. No malware or security vulnerabilities are identifiable in this module.",
