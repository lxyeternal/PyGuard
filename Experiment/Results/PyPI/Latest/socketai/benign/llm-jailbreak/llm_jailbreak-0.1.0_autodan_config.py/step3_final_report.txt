  "purpose": "Defines configuration parameters for the AutoDAN testing pipeline, including model paths, names, API key, and test prefixes.",
  "sources": "Default model paths, model names, and test prefixes; optional api_key parameter.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication; no data leaks or command execution.",
  "flows": "Initialization of configuration parameters without external data flow or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python dataclass setting default configuration parameters for a testing pipeline. It initializes model paths and names, test prefixes, and optional API key, with no external input handling, network activity, or code execution. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify it as benign configuration code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, which are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It serves solely as a configuration setup for a larger system. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and accurate.",
