  "purpose": "Definition and initialization of configuration parameters for AutoDAN testing pipeline, including model settings, API keys, algorithm parameters, and file paths.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the environment for 'api_key' (optional) and the dataset file at './data/advbench/harmful_behaviors.csv'. Data is also loaded via default model and model name settings, which are hardcoded defaults.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present. The 'api_key' could be a potential sink if misused, but it is optional and not handled directly in this code. The code writes no data or executes any external commands.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flow paths from input sources to sinks; the code mainly sets default configuration values and initializes internal variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior detected. The code contains standard configuration setup with default values and conditional initializations. No hardcoded secrets other than default model paths and names, which are publicly available data. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass for configuration, with default model paths, model names, and test prefixes. It uses standard Python features such as dataclasses and dictionaries. No external commands, no data leaks, no network activity, and no sensitive data handling are present. The 'api_key' is optional and not used within this snippet. Default values and setup logic are straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for an AutoDAN testing pipeline, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily assigns default values and initializes parameters. No suspicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
