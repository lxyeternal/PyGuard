  "purpose": "Importing 'rpcs' from a local module named 'valid'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module 'valid' to import 'rpcs'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing 'rpcs' from the local module 'valid'.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only a relative import statement; no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "This snippet performs a straightforward relative import from a module named 'valid'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, hidden code, or obfuscated logic. The code structure appears typical for Python projects that organize code into modules. Without additional context or code, no malicious activity can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign and appears to be a standard import of a module component.",
