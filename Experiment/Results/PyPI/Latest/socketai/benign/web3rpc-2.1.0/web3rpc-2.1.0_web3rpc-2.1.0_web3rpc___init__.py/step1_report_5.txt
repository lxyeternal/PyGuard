  "purpose": "Import the 'rpcs' object or function from the local module 'valid'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'valid' from the current package directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; it only performs an import.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data sources to sinks are visible in this line.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, but the only notable aspect is the relative import, which is common. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "This snippet performs a simple relative import of 'rpcs' from the 'valid' module within the same package. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The code itself is straightforward and typical for Python packages. Since this is just an import statement, it does not include any code execution, data handling, or network activity that could be malicious. Without additional context or related code, there are no indicators of security risks or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a normal part of a Python package structure.",
