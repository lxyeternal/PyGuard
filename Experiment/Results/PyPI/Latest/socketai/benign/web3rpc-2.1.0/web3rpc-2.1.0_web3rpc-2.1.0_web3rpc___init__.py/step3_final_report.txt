{
  "purpose": "This code performs a relative import of 'rpcs' from the local module 'valid'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; the code only imports a symbol.",
  "flows": "The import flows from the 'valid' module to the current namespace; no external data flow or network activity involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation detected. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import statement, which is common in Python modules. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The import does not perform any network activity, data leakage, or system modification. The simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior lead to a high confidence that this code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, standard Python module import.",
