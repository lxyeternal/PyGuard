  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Issue present?** No. The code is a simple import statement.\n   - **Errors or flaws?** None. The reasoning is sound.\n   - **Scores:** All scores (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Justification:** No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The confidence score of 1 aligns with the analysis.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Issue present?** No. Same as above.\n   - **Errors or flaws?** None.\n   - **Scores:** All zero, which is reasonable.\n   - **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The confidence of 1 is justified.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Issue present?** No. Again, just an import.\n   - **Errors or flaws?** None.\n   - **Scores:** All zero, consistent with the analysis.\n   - **Justification:** No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk identified. Slightly lower confidence (0.9) is acceptable given the minimal context, but still aligns with the benign nature.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Issue present?** No.\n   - **Errors or flaws?** None.\n   - **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n   - **Justification:** No malicious intent or suspicious behavior; straightforward import.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Issue present?** No.\n   - **Errors or flaws?** None.\n   - **Scores:** All zero, matching the benign assessment.\n   - **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is correct given the code snippets.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, since no security risks are evident.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are consistent and correctly interpret the import statements as benign.\n- No assumptions are made beyond the provided code, and no suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate given the minimal code.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- **Scores:** The current scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n- **Estimated scores after review:**\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** All reports correctly identify the code as benign. No changes are necessary.",
