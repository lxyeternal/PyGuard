{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'web3rpc' Python library, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists, open, os.path.abspath, os.path.dirname, find_packages",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; file operations are reading known local files, and package setup is static.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content into long_description without untrusted data influence; no dynamic code execution or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without context manager; no apparent malicious behavior, just standard packaging code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: determining the current directory, reading a README file for long description, and configuring package metadata. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved that could lead to malicious activity. The file operation is straightforward and read-only. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup file with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. It simply prepares package metadata for distribution.",
