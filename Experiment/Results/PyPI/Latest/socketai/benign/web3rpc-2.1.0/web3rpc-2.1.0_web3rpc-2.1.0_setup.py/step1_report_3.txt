  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'web3rpc'.",
  "sources": "os.path, os, setuptools (imported modules), open(readme file)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data effects present",
  "flows": "Readme file content from disk, use in setup metadata; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; straightforward setup script",
  "analysis": "The script loads the README.md content if available, then uses setuptools to define package metadata. No input validation or external data processing that could introduce vulnerabilities. No dynamic code execution, no data leaks, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious behavior. The code follows standard packaging patterns without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is benign, standard, and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
