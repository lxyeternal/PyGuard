  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'web3rpc' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data used or written in a vulnerable manner",
  "flows": "N/A; the script only reads a file and calls setup() without external data injection",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script that reads a README file to include as the long description and then invokes setuptools.setup() with package metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. The code follows typical packaging conventions without anomalies or obfuscation. It appears to be a straightforward package configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
