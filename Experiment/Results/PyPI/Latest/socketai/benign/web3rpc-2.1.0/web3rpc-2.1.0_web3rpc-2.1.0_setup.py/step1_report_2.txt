  "flows": "os.path.exists -> open(readme_path) -> read()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No unusual code patterns or obfuscated code. The code performs standard setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically reads the README.md file for the long description, ensuring it exists before reading. It uses standard setuptools functions to find packages and define package metadata. There are no suspicious code behaviors, no network activity, or external data manipulations beyond standard package setup. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
