  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'web3rpc' to facilitate package distribution.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists, open, os.path.abspath, os.path.dirname, os.path.join, find_packages, setup",
  "sinks": "open (reading README.md), setup (defining package metadata)",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content into 'long_description' during setup process",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Use of standard setup procedures. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads the README.md file if it exists, then calls setuptools.setup with package metadata and configuration. It uses common libraries and functions for package setup without executing untrusted code or handling sensitive data. No indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign and standard for Python package distribution. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code.",
