{
  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'web3rpc' library, reading README.md for long description and invoking setuptools.setup() with package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file if it exists, using os.path and open() functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network or code execution occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads local README.md file, then passes data to setuptools.setup() without further data flow or external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() without a context manager, which is a best practice but not a security flaw; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a local README.md file if present, then calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The code adheres to common packaging practices and contains no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only minor technical note is the absence of a context manager for the open() call, which does not impact security or malware detection.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward and safe. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are appropriate and should remain at zero.",
