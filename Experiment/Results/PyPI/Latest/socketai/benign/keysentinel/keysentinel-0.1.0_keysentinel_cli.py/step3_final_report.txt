  "purpose": "CLI tool for secure token encryption, decryption, and management with masking, clipboard handling, and clearance features.",
  "sources": "User input prompts, profile data retrieval, external encryption/decryption functions, clipboard access.",
  "sinks": "Terminal output (masked or real secrets), clipboard, external storage functions.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> encryption/decryption -> display or clipboard -> timed clearance from terminal and clipboard.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected. Export options are blocked with warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard secure practices: masking secrets, timed clearing, blocking export options, and secure prompts. External functions are assumed trustworthy. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Minor typo in profile data assignment is trivial and does not impact security. Overall, the implementation aligns with best practices for secret management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure CLI for secret management with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.2, justified by its security-focused design and external dependencies.",
