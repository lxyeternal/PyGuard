  "flows": "The string 'zen_manifesto' is assigned a static value; then it flows directly to the print() function for output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The manifesto is a static string; no dynamic code, obfuscation, or external data sources present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static multi-line string variable containing a philosophical manifesto. The string is printed directly with no external inputs, user data, or network interactions. There are no suspicious behaviors, code injections, or malicious actions. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical practices for displaying static messages.",
  "conclusion": "This code only outputs a static, hardcoded manifesto message and does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. It appears to serve an informational purpose without any indicators of malicious intent.",
