  "purpose": "Display a philosophical manifesto about Zero Trust security principles.",
  "sources": "The variable 'zen_manifesto' defined as a multiline string, and the 'print' function that outputs it.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' function outputs data to standard output; no external data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "The 'zen_manifesto' string is assigned and then directly printed; no untrusted input flows into any sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and solely outputs a predefined text.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a philosophical text to a variable and then prints it. There are no external inputs, no dynamic data, and no suspicious code constructs. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or malicious code segments. The content is a static message about security principles, with no indications of malicious intent. The use of a multiline string and print function are standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign script that outputs a static philosophical message. There is no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks detected.",
