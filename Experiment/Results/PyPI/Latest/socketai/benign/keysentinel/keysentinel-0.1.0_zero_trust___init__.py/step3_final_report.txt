  "purpose": "Display a philosophical cybersecurity manifesto as static text.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static string assigned to variable 'zen_manifesto'.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs the static string; no untrusted data flow or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "N/A – static content; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static multi-line string containing cybersecurity principles and prints it. No external inputs, dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. All reviews correctly identify the benign nature, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1, reflecting certainty. The code poses no security risks or malicious intent, and the scores are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving solely to display a static philosophical message. There are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and appropriate.",
