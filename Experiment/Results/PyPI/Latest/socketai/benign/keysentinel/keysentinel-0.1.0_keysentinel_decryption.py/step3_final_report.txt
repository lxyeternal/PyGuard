{
  "purpose": "Retrieve encrypted secrets from a vault via subprocess, load a local encryption key, and decrypt specific fields using Fernet encryption.",
  "sources": "Subprocess calls to 'op' CLI for vault item retrieval; reading local key file; JSON parsing of vault data.",
  "sinks": "Decryption function that processes encrypted field values; no direct data leaks or network sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Subprocess output (vault data) -> JSON parsing -> decrypt_token() -> decrypted fields stored in dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "Silent exception handling during decryption, reliance on external CLI without input validation, no validation of subprocess output, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard secret retrieval and decryption routines with clear structure. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Silent error handling could mask issues but is not malicious. External CLI reliance is a potential environmental risk but not an inherent vulnerability. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for secret management, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The main security considerations relate to environment trust and error handling, which are typical in such contexts. Scores are consistent with the analysis: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2-0.3.",
