{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of secret profile schemas for various third-party services and includes helper functions to load custom profiles from a JSON file and merge them with default profiles.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'KEYSENTINEL_CUSTOM_PROFILES_PATH', reads the JSON file from the specified or default path, and loads JSON data from the file.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code reads configuration data but does not process or transmit data outside the context of the functions.",
  "flows": "Environment variable determines file path -> file existence check -> file read and JSON parsing -> merging with default profiles.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present in the code. The code allows loading external JSON files which could potentially include malicious content if untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly provides a structure for defining and loading API token profiles, including merging user-provided custom profiles from a JSON file. It performs environment variable expansion and file existence checks before reading JSON data. No malicious functions or behaviors such as data exfiltration, command execution, or obfuscated code are present. The only potential concern is the external JSON file that can contain malicious content, but this is a standard pattern for configuration loading, not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration management utility that loads profile schemas, with no malicious behavior or malware. Its security risk is minimal but relies on safe handling of external JSON files. No suspicious activity or malicious intent is detected.",
