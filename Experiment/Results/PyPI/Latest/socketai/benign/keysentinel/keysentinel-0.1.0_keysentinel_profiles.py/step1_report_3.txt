{
  "purpose": "Define and manage a set of predefined and customizable secret key profiles for various services, allowing for secure handling of API credentials.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (KEYSENTINEL_CUSTOM_PROFILES_PATH) to locate a custom profiles JSON file and reads this JSON file from disk if it exists.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit data; it loads data from the environment and filesystem into program variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variable KEYSENTINEL_CUSTOM_PROFILES_PATH -> load_custom_profiles_from_json() -> json.load() -> merge with default TOKEN_PROFILES",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded secrets beyond predefined service profiles; the JSON loading is standard. The example JSON is a string constant, not executed or used directly. No dynamic code execution or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages configuration data for API keys and tokens. It loads a default set of profiles and optionally extends them with user-provided custom profiles from a JSON file specified by an environment variable or default path. The functions perform straightforward file existence checks, JSON parsing, and merging of dictionaries. There are no data leaks, network communication, or obfuscated/malicious code segments. All operations are standard configuration management routines, with safe file handling and environment variable use. No hardcoded credentials are stored or transmitted.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration management utility for handling secret profiles. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It operates securely by avoiding unsafe operations and does not leak data or execute arbitrary code.",
