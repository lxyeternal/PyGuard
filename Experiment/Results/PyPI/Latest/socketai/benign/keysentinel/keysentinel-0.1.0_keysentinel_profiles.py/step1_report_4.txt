  "purpose": "Define and manage profiles for various API tokens and credentials, including loading custom profiles from a JSON file.",
  "sources": "Environment variable KEYSENTINEL_CUSTOM_PROFILES_PATH; JSON file at the specified path; hardcoded TOKEN_PROFILES dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Reading from environment variable and JSON file; no data sinks or output operations present.",
  "flows": "Environment variable specifies JSON file path -> load_custom_profiles_from_json reads JSON file -> get_token_profiles merges default and custom profiles.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded credentials beyond predefined tokens, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. The code simply loads configuration data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static token profiles and provides functions to load additional profiles from a JSON file specified by an environment variable or default path. The JSON loading is handled securely with exception catching. There are no active network operations, no code execution, no credential leaks, or malicious actions. The profile management appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration and profile management utility without malicious intent or malicious behavior. It simply loads and merges configuration data from static and user-defined sources. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
