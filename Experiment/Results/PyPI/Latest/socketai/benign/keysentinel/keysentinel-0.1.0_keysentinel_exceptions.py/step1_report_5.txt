  "purpose": "Define a custom exception for handling vault operation errors.",
  "sources": "No data sources or input reading present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flows, input-to-output, or data processing flows exist.",
  "anomalies": "Code is a simple class declaration with no dynamic code, secrets, or obfuscation. The class is minimal, and there are no suspicious constructs or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a custom exception class definition inheriting from Exception. It includes a docstring and a pass statement, which are standard in Python class definitions. There are no signs of code injection, malicious logic, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements. The simplicity suggests it is a standard custom exception implementation. No evidence of malware or security issues within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward definition of a custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks. It is typical boilerplate for exception handling in Python. No security concerns detected.",
