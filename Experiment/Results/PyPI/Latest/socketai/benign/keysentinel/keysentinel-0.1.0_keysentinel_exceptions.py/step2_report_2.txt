  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition for a custom exception (`VaultOperationError`) inheriting from `Exception`. There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or complex logic. The only noteworthy element is the `pass` statement, which is standard in class declarations that do not define additional methods or attributes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that the code is benign, minimal, and free of malicious or suspicious constructs.  \n- They correctly note that the `pass` statement is redundant but harmless.  \n- No logical flaws or security issues are identified, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:  \n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with obfuscated, malware, and securityRisk scores at 0. This is appropriate given the code's nature.  \n- Since the code is a straightforward class definition with no suspicious features, the scores seem reasonable.  \n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Justification**:  \n- The risk score is 0 because the code does not perform any operations, data handling, or external interactions that could pose security risks.  \n- The malware score is 0, as there's no indication of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden payloads.  \n- The consistent conclusion across reports supports these scores.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n- All reports correctly avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the actual code content.  \n- They recognize the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n6. **Score Consistency and Final Estimation**:  \n- The scores are consistent with the code snippet.  \n- Given the totality of the reports, the overall assessment aligns with the code's intent and content.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 — no security risk associated with this class definition.\n\n### Summary:\nThis code snippet is a minimal, benign class definition for a custom exception. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing reports' scores and conclusions are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the current scores and assessments are accurate.",
