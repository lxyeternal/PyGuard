  "purpose": "Definition of a custom exception class for vault operations errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains an unnecessary 'pass' statement inside the class body; no other anomalies or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class named VaultOperationError, inheriting from Exception, with a docstring explaining its purpose. There are no data inputs, external calls, or complex logic. The 'pass' statement is redundant but not malicious. Overall, the code is minimal and straightforward, serving as a class definition for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic, benign class definition for custom exception handling related to vault operations. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
