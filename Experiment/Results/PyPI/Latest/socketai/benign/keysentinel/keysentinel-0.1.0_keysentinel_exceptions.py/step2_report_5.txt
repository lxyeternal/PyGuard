  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition for a custom exception (`VaultOperationError`) inheriting from `Exception`. There are no data inputs, external calls, or complex logic. The 'pass' statement is redundant but benign. No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident. The analysis appropriately dismisses the 'pass' statement as harmless.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- confidence: 1 (high confidence)\n- obfuscated: 0\n- malware: 0\n- securityRisk: 0\n\nThese scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Higher Risk Scores**  \nSince all reports agree on zero malware and security risk, and the code is straightforward, there's no justification for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**  \nAll reports assign malware = 0, which is correct. The code does not contain any malicious constructs.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid assumptions and stick to factual analysis. They correctly interpret the code as a benign class definition.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, standard custom exception class with no malicious or suspicious features. The reports' assessments are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are justified as they stand. No changes are necessary.",
