  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for vault operation errors.",
  "sources": "Class declaration; no external data or inputs.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; class only defines an exception type.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant 'pass' statement, but harmless; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimal custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with a docstring and a pass statement. No external calls, data handling, or complex logic are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious or suspicious features. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign class definition for a custom exception with no security risks or malicious intent. The assessments and scores across reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
