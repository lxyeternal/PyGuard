{
  "purpose": "This module appears to define the public interface for encryption and decryption functionalities, along with a custom exception, likely related to vault operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .encryption, .decryption, and .exceptions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code fragment",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports functions and defines __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific functions and an exception class from local modules and declares these in __all__, which controls exported symbols. There are no data processing, user input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. This appears to be a straightforward module interface definition without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple interface definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It only manages imports and exports for related cryptographic functions and exceptions.",
