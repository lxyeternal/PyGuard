{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a module that manages encryption and decryption operations, along with handling related exceptions.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.encryption, .decryption, .exceptions), which do not involve user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Exports of functions and exception classes, which are used elsewhere; no direct sinks for untrusted data in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are explicitly visible in this code fragment; it only sets up exports for other functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code structure and imports are typical for modular Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines module exports for encryption/decryption functions and an exception class. It does not perform any data processing, I/O, or external communications. The imported functions likely handle sensitive data, but this file does not include any logic that could be malicious. There are no obfuscation techniques or suspicious patterns. It appears to be standard modular setup code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module definition that exports encryption, decryption, and exception handling components. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this fragment. It appears safe and well-structured.",
