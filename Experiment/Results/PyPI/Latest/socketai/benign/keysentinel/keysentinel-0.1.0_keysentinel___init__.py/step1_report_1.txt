{
  "purpose": "Module re-exports of functions and classes related to encryption, decryption, and exceptions for a vault or secure storage system.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .encryption, .decryption, .exceptions",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code only performs re-exporting of functions and classes",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; only module exports without data processing or handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and an exception class from internal modules and declares them in __all__ for module exports. No external data input, no untrusted data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and serves as a re-export layer, which is typical for organizing modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple interface layer with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It only re-exports functions and exceptions related to encryption/decryption operations.",
