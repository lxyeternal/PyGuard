  "purpose": "Re-exports functions and classes related to encryption, decryption, and exceptions for module interface.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.encryption, .decryption, .exceptions).",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Direct import to __all__ declaration; no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward re-export with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports specific functions and classes from internal modules and exposes them via __all__. It contains no data processing, external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns justify these scores. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present. The code's security posture depends on the imported modules, but this cannot be inferred here. The scores are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward re-export module with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the current scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
