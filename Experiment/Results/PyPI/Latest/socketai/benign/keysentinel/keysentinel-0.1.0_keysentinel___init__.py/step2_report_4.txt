  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the original code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The original code is a straightforward module that re-exports functions and classes related to encryption, decryption, and exceptions.\n- It imports from internal modules (.encryption, .decryption, .exceptions) and declares them in `__all__`.\n- There are no data flows, no input/output handling, no network operations, and no dynamic code execution.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The code is typical for organizing a public API surface in a modular Python package.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1-5:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple re-export module.\n- They note the absence of data processing, external data handling, or suspicious behavior.\n- They assign high confidence (1) that the code is benign.\n- Malware score is 0 in all reports.\n- Security risk is 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Any discrepancies?**\n- No. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code is as per the original snippet, with no malicious or security issues.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate, since no malicious activity is present.\n  - Security risk: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct, code is straightforward.\n  - Risk score: 0 — aligns with the above.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions and correctly interpret the code as a simple interface layer.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this module, I agree with the reports' conclusions. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk in this code snippet.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely structural, serving as an interface for other modules. No malicious activity, no suspicious patterns, and no data flows that could introduce security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe, with no signs of malware or obfuscation, and poses no security risk. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
