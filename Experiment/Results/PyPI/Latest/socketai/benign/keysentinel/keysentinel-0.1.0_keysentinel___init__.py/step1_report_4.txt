  "purpose": "This module re-exports functions and classes related to encryption, decryption, and exceptions for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .encryption, .decryption, and .exceptions",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; purely re-exporting symbols",
  "flows": "Imports from internal modules; no data flows from external or untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports specific functions and exceptions from internal modules and defines an __all__ list for exports. There are no network operations, data processing, or security-sensitive code present. It appears to be a simple re-export file intended to organize module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, serves as an export interface, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
