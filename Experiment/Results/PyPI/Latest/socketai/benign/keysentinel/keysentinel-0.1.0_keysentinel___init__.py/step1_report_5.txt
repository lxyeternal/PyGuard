{
  "purpose": "Module exports functions related to encryption and decryption operations, as well as an exception class, for secure data handling.",
  "sources": "No input reading, data sources are implied to be from other modules or external data when functions are called.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling in this snippet; functions are just imported and re-exported.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows are visible within this code snippet; it only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be straightforward module re-exports.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific functions and an exception class from local modules and defines an __all__ list for public API exposure. There are no data manipulations, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be standard module setup code with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module re-export pattern with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It serves as an interface to encryption-related functions and exception handling, with no harmful or suspicious elements.",
