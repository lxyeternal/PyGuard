  "purpose": "Define default paths and names for encryption key and vault used by a CLI tool.",
  "sources": "os.path.expanduser('~/.mycli_key') - reads the user's home directory path.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling; only setting constants.",
  "flows": "Input from the environment (user's home directory) assigned to a constant for key storage.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard use of environment expansion to define default file path.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a default file path for an encryption key based on the user's home directory and a default vault name. Both are simple constants. There is no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be part of a configuration setup for a CLI application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, setting default constants for a CLI application's key storage and vault name. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues in this fragment.",
