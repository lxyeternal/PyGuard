  "purpose": "Define default file path for encryption key and default vault name for a CLI application.",
  "sources": "os.path.expanduser() function call to determine the key file path.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data usage present.",
  "flows": "The code generates a file path from a trusted function and assigns a static vault name, with no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a default path for storing an encryption key based on the user's home directory and assigns a static string for the vault name. It uses standard library functions without any obfuscation or dynamic code execution. No data input or external communication occurs. The code appears to be configuration setup with safe usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines configuration constants for a CLI tool.",
