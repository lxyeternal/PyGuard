  "purpose": "Defines default configuration paths and names for a CLI tool, including a local encryption key path and vault name.",
  "sources": "os.path.expanduser() function which reads the user's home directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data directly influences sensitive operations or outputs.",
  "flows": "Input from the environment (user's home directory) used to set default file path and name.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code straightforwardly sets default constants with environment expansion.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module to determine a default path for storing an encryption key within the user's home directory. It uses os.path.expanduser() to safely resolve the user's home directory, which is a common and acceptable pattern. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hardcoded secrets is present. The second line sets a default vault name, which is benign. The code appears to be standard configuration initialization without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply sets default configuration constants for a CLI application without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
