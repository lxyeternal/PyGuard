  "purpose": "Define default configuration paths and names for a CLI application.",
  "sources": "os.path.expanduser(\"~/.mycli_key\") to resolve user home directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static constants only.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static configuration code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, defines a default key path using expanduser to locate a file in the user's home directory, and sets a static vault name. It contains no dynamic input, no network activity, no code execution beyond setting constants, and no suspicious or malicious behavior. The code is typical for configuration purposes, with no hardcoded secrets or vulnerabilities. All signals indicate benign intent, and the code structure is simple and clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
