  "purpose": "Set default configuration parameters for a CLI tool, specifically for key storage path and vault name.",
  "sources": "os.path.expanduser(\"~/.mycli_key\")",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating potential data leakage or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and only defines default values.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and defines two constants: one for the default key storage path using expanduser to resolve the user's home directory, and another for the vault name. There are no dynamic inputs, user inputs, or external data sources. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The code is purely for setting default parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, only setting default values for a CLI application's configuration. There is no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
