  "purpose": "Define default file path for encryption key and default vault name for CLI tokens",
  "sources": "os.path.expanduser(\"~/.mycli_key\")",
  "sinks": "None identified",
  "flows": "None, as no data is transferred or used in a way that affects system security beyond variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.path.expanduser to determine a file path for a key; no hardcoded secrets or sensitive data embedded in the code",
  "analysis": "The code sets constants for a default key path and vault name. The key path is dynamically generated using os.path.expanduser, which is a standard way to reference user directories. There are no other code constructs, inputs, or outputs present. No suspicious or malicious behavior is apparent. The code appears to be a basic configuration setup without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration snippet defining default paths and names with no signs of malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior. It does not pose any security risks.",
