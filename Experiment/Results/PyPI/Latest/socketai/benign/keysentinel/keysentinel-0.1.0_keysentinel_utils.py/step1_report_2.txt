{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to securely copy text to the clipboard, mask secret values, and automatically clear the clipboard after a specified timeout.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'text' parameter in safe_copy_to_clipboard() and potentially any external code calling this function; also, the import of pyperclip and data from the clipboard are relevant sources.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to the clipboard via pyperclip.copy() and subprocess calls to system clipboard utilities, which could be considered sinks if untrusted data is copied.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (e.g., 'text') flows from the safe_copy_to_clipboard() function into the clipboard, then the clipboard content is overwritten after timeout by the subprocess spawned in clear_clipboard_after_timeout(), which overwrites the clipboard with random trash, then clears it.",
  "anomalies": "The subprocess spawns a detached process that overwrites and clears the clipboard after a timeout using random strings and system-specific commands; however, this is consistent with intended clipboard cleaning behavior, not malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to copy data to the clipboard securely, mask secret values, and clear the clipboard after a delay. It uses 'pyperclip' for cross-platform clipboard access, spawning a subprocess to run a delayed cleanup. The subprocess runs a Python script that overwrites the clipboard with random trash and then clears it, depending on the OS. No malicious network activity, credential theft, or backdoors are evident. The use of subprocess with a delay for clipboard cleaning is a legitimate security feature rather than malicious behavior. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement secure clipboard handling with timed cleanup, masking of secrets, and no signs of malicious intent. It is designed to prevent clipboard data leakage rather than to harm or exfiltrate data. The overall security risk is minimal.",
