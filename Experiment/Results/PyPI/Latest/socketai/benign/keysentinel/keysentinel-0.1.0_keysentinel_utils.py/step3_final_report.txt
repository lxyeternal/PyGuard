  "purpose": "Clipboard management with delayed overwriting to prevent data leakage.",
  "sources": "Reading input text for copying; generating random strings; system info for OS-specific commands.",
  "sinks": "Clipboard content overwritten via subprocess or pyperclip, potentially affecting clipboard data.",
  "flows": "safe_copy_to_clipboard -> generate random trash -> subprocess or pyperclip.copy -> delayed overwrite",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess with shell=True; embedded script for clipboard overwrite; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code copies user data to clipboard and spawns a background process to overwrite or clear it after a delay, using OS-specific commands. No malicious activity, exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The subprocess with shell=True is a minor security concern but controlled. No obfuscation present. The masking function is benign. Overall, the code is a privacy utility with minimal security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed for privacy preservation by overwriting clipboard data after a delay. No signs of malware or malicious intent are detected. The current scores are appropriate; malware score should remain at 0, obfuscation at 0, and risk at approximately 0.2 due to subprocess usage.",
