{
  "purpose": "The code performs a relative import of all symbols from the 'starts' module within the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local 'starts' module in the package directory.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; potential issues depend on the contents of 'starts' which are not provided.",
  "flows": "The import loads symbols from 'starts' into the current namespace, but no runtime data flow or untrusted data handling is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import with a wildcard, which is discouraged due to namespace pollution and difficulty in static analysis. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are apparent from this line alone. The security implications depend on the content of 'starts'. The import style itself is a poor practice but not inherently malicious. The lack of additional code or context limits definitive conclusions. The wildcard import could conceal malicious code if 'starts' is compromised, but this cannot be determined here.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement itself is benign but risky in practice due to the use of 'import *'. No evidence of malicious behavior is present in this snippet. Further inspection of the 'starts' module is necessary to confirm security, but based solely on this line, the code is safe. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a slight concern (risk score ~0.2) due to the import style.",
