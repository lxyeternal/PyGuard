{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a module named 'starts' within the same package, likely to utilize functions, classes, or variables defined there.",
  "sources": "Import statement accessing the local module 'starts' (relative import).",
  "sinks": "None present in this snippet; no direct data handling or untrusted input sources shown.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows observable within this single line of code; import may trigger execution of 'starts' module upon import.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') is generally discouraged as it can obscure what is being imported and potentially hide malicious code or unwanted side effects. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "This code is a simple relative import statement from a module named 'starts'. Since it only imports everything from 'starts', no direct security risks or malicious behavior can be determined from this snippet alone. However, the use of '*' import can be suspicious if 'starts' contains malicious code, or if it masks dangerous functions or variables. Without inspecting 'starts', it's impossible to fully evaluate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are visible in this line.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard relative import, but the use of wildcard import warrants caution, especially if 'starts' contains malicious code. No direct malicious activity or security issues are evident in this snippet alone, but further review of the 'starts' module is recommended.",
