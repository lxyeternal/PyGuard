  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .starts import *\n```\n\n**Confirming the presence of issues:**\n- All reports correctly identify that this is a relative import of all contents from the 'starts' module within the same package.\n- There are no other code lines or behaviors to evaluate, so no malicious activity can be directly observed from this snippet alone.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- None of the reports claim that malicious code is present; they all correctly state that the import alone doesn't demonstrate malicious activity.\n- They consistently note that wildcard imports ('*') are discouraged due to namespace pollution and potential obscuration of imported content, which is accurate.\n- The reports appropriately recommend further review of the 'starts' module for comprehensive security assessment, which is prudent.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- The confidence scores vary between 0.5 and 0.9, which seems reasonable given the limited context.\n- Malware scores are all 0, aligning with the conclusion that no malicious activity is evident.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting the minimal apparent risk based solely on this import statement.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.3, which is appropriate given the lack of evidence.\n- Since no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are observed or inferred, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n\n**Malware score considerations:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- Importing a module with a wildcard does not inherently imply malicious intent; it depends on the content of 'starts'.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious code within 'starts' without further evidence.\n- They recommend further review, which is the right approach.\n\n**Score consistency:**\n- The scores align well with the narrative and the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The code snippet is a standard relative import statement.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk is present based solely on this line.\n- The use of '*' import is discouraged but not malicious.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect the poor practice of wildcard import but no actual risk)\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and cautious, correctly avoiding overestimating risk or malware presence. They appropriately suggest further review of 'starts' for comprehensive security but recognize that the import statement itself is benign.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- I agree with the assessments that this code snippet is not malicious.\n- The scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n- The main concern is the use of 'import *', which should be avoided but does not constitute a security threat by itself.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\nThis conservative approach emphasizes that the import is not inherently dangerous but highlights best practices.",
