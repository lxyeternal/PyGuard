  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'starts'.",
  "sources": "The import statement sources code from the local module 'starts'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external output occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible with only an import statement; no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .starts import *' can lead to namespace pollution and hidden dependencies, but this is not inherently malicious. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "This snippet performs a relative import from the 'starts' module within the same package. As it only includes an import statement, there are no direct security issues or malicious behaviors visible. The code does not involve data handling, input/output, or execution of untrusted code within this fragment. Without additional context or content from 'starts', further assessment is limited.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard import statement with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The use of 'import *' is discouraged due to potential namespace pollution but is not malicious.",
