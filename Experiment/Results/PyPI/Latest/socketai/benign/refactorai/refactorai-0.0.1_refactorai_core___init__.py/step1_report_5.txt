  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module 'starts'.",

  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow can be determined from this single import statement alone.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a wildcard import, which can obscure imported content, but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code snippet performs a relative import of all contents from the 'starts' module. Without further context or the content of 'starts', it's impossible to determine malicious intent. Wildcard imports are generally discouraged as they can lead to namespace pollution and obscure dependencies, but they are not inherently malicious. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident in this single line.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple relative import statement with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
