  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement; no anomalies or suspicious behavior are visible.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a standard import from a relative module, which is common in Python packages. Since it only imports everything from 'starts', there are no evident malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious activities. The lack of additional code limits the scope of analysis, but nothing appears malicious or insecure here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical package import with no anomalies.",
