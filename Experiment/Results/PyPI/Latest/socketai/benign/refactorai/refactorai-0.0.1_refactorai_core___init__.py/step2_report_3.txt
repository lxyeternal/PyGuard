  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code snippet.\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\nfrom .starts import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports focus on the use of a relative wildcard import (`from .starts import *`).\n- Wildcard imports are generally discouraged because they obscure what is imported, making code harder to audit and maintain.\n- The actual content of the `starts` module is unknown, which limits definitive security conclusions.\n- No direct malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident from this import statement alone.\n- The reports uniformly state that no direct data flows, sinks, or anomalies are present besides the import style.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the import statement itself does not contain malicious code or vulnerabilities. However, the use of `import *` can hide malicious code if `starts` is compromised.\n- **Errors or flaws in logic:** No explicit errors, but reliance on wildcard import is a bad practice and can hide malicious code.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: All reports assign `0`, which is reasonable given the limited snippet.\n  - Obfuscated: All `0`, which is consistent.\n  - Security risk: Ranges from 0.2 to 0.3, which is somewhat cautious but acceptable given the context.\n  - Confidence scores are high, reflecting the limited scope.\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware risk:** Since the code only performs an import, and no malicious code is visible, a malware score of 0 is appropriate. However, if `starts` is compromised, it could introduce malicious behavior at runtime, but this cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.\n- **Obfuscated code:** No obfuscation is present.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The main concern is the use of `import *`, which can hide malicious code or unintended behavior if `starts` contains malicious content.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Further review of `starts`:** Essential to determine if malicious code exists within that module.\n- **Avoid wildcard imports:** For clarity and security, explicit imports are preferred.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity in this snippet)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2–0.3 (caution due to wildcard import, but not inherently dangerous)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code itself is benign.\n- The primary concern is the use of `import *`, which can conceal malicious code if `starts` is compromised.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident from this snippet alone.\n- Further review of the `starts` module is recommended for a comprehensive security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Overall, I agree with the current scores, but I would emphasize that the main risk stems from the import style rather than the code snippet itself.**",
