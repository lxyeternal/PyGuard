{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the module 'starts' within the same package, likely to utilize functions, classes, or variables defined there.",
  "sources": "The import statement indicates the source is the 'starts' module within the same package/directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in this snippet; potential risks depend on what is imported and used elsewhere.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this single line; it merely imports symbols from another module.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a wildcard import (*) can obscure what is imported, potentially hiding malicious code or unwanted behavior, especially if the 'starts' module contains malicious or unnecessary code.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs an import operation from a relative module 'starts'. The presence of a wildcard import can be suspicious if the imported module contains malicious code or unnecessary components. Since this is the only line, there is no direct malicious activity observed here, but the import could bring in harmful code if 'starts' is compromised. No other anomalies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is minimal evidence of malicious behavior. However, the use of wildcard import warrants caution, as it may conceal malicious or unnecessary code within the 'starts' module. Further review of 'starts' is recommended for comprehensive security assessment.",
