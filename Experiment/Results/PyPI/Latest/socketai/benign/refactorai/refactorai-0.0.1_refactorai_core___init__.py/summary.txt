  "conclusion": "The import statement itself is benign but risky in practice due to the use of 'import *'. No evidence of malicious behavior is present in this snippet. Further inspection of the 'starts' module is necessary to confirm security, but based solely on this line, the code is safe. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a slight concern (risk score ~0.2) due to the import style."
