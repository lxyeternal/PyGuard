  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom .ai_client import AIClient\nfrom .prompts import AIPrompts\n```\nThis is a minimal import statement, importing classes from local modules within the same package.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Confirm if issues are present in the code\n- **Are there any issues?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward module imports with no apparent malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n\n### 2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic\n- **Are the reports accurate?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no anomalies or malicious behavior. They uniformly conclude the code is standard, with high confidence.\n\n### 3. Review scores assigned to each issue\n- **Scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk:**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n  These are appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n- **Confidence scores:**  \n  Mostly 1 or 0.9, which seem reasonable given the minimal code.\n\n### 4. Justify risk scores higher than 0.5\n- Since all reports assign zero risk and the code is trivial, there's no justification for higher scores.\n\n### 5. Malware score considerations\n- **Malware score is 0 across all reports.**  \n  Correct. The code only imports local modules, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n### 6. Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n### 7. Consistency of scores\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent.** There are no signs of malicious activity or security issues in this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThe code is a standard import statement with no security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. No changes needed.",
