  "purpose": "This code imports two modules, AIClient and AIPrompts, likely for AI-related functionality within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules: .ai_client and .prompts",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in these import statements",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with only import statements; no source-to-sink paths",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only import statements with no suspicious or unusual patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements",
  "analysis": "The code snippet consists solely of two import statements importing local modules. There is no execution, data handling, or network activity. No anomalies such as hidden backdoors, code obfuscation, or malicious code are present. Given the limited context, this appears to be standard module imports with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing standard import statements for module dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this snippet.",
