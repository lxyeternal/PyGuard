  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is limited to import statements from local modules (.ai_client and .prompts). There are no signs of external data handling, execution, or malicious activity in this minimal snippet.\n   - Confirmed: **No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in the code.**\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough in their analysis, correctly noting the benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware and securityRisk scores of 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence scores are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), which is reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n   - **No adjustments needed** here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree that the code is benign, the risk scores are appropriately set to 0.\n   - No justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns.\n   - They correctly identify the code as standard import statements without malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code snippet provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### My Reasoned Estimate:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I concur with the existing scores.\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, with no malicious or security concerns.**",
