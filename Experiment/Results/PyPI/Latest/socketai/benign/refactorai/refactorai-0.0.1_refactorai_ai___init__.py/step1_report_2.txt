  "purpose": "Importing classes AIClient and AIPrompts from local modules for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no output or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable as the code only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements without hidden or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from relative modules within the package. No external input handling, no data processing, and no execution logic are present. This snippet alone does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be part of a larger project structure. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It does not contain any malware, obfuscation, or security concerns based on this snippet alone.",
