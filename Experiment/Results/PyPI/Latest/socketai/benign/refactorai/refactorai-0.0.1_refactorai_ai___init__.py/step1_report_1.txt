  "purpose": "The code appears to import classes from local modules, likely to facilitate AI client interactions and prompts.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.ai_client' and '.prompts' modules, which are internal and do not involve external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is demonstrated in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are present in this minimal snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from relative modules within the same package. There are no evident malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or obfuscated code. The structure is straightforward, importing two classes that likely serve as components in a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, serving as module imports for internal components. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
