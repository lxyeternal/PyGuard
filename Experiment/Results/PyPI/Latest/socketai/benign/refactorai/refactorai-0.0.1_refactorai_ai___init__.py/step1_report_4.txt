  "purpose": "The code imports classes AIClient and AIPrompts from local modules, likely for AI-related functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads from local modules (.ai_client and .prompts) during import statements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable within this minimal code snippet; it only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, with straightforward import statements; no anomalies or suspicious constructs are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, which is standard practice in Python. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The code does not interact with external data, environment variables, or perform any operations that could be malicious. As it is only import statements, it provides no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is a simple import of modules, typical in Python projects.",
