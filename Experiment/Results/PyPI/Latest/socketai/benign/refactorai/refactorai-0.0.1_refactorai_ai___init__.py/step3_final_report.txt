{
  "purpose": "The code imports two classes from local modules within the same package, likely for use in further application logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only imports classes from local modules (.ai_client and .prompts).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as no data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are present. The import statements are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, indicating a standard module setup. No malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. High confidence in this assessment is justified due to the simplicity and clarity of the code snippet. No vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
