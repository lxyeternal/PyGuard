  "purpose": "Check for the presence of an environment variable REFACTORAI_API_KEY and terminate the program if it is not set.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable REFACTORAI_API_KEY using os.getenv.",
  "sinks": "Potentially terminates the process with sys.exit(1) if the environment variable is missing.",
  "flows": "Code reads environment variable REFACTORAI_API_KEY and if absent, outputs an error message and exits.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a function to check for an API key environment variable, and exits if the key is not set. It performs standard environment variable access and error handling. No data leakage, malicious actions, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code simply enforces the presence of a required API key for subsequent operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a basic environment variable check with safe error handling. No malicious intent or security risks are identified. It is a typical pattern for API key validation.",
