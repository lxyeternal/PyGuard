  "flows": "Environment variable read -> conditional check -> error message and exit",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward environment variable validation",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and performs a simple check for an environment variable. It outputs an error message and terminates if the variable is missing. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The logic is clear and typical for configuration validation. The environment variable is read securely, and the code does not perform any dangerous actions or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment variable check with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, though the security risk score could be lowered to 0.0 for more accuracy, as no security vulnerabilities are present.",
