  "purpose": "To check for the presence of an API key in the environment variable REFACTORAI_API_KEY before proceeding.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable REFACTORAI_API_KEY via os.getenv()",

  "flows": "Environment variable REFACTORAI_API_KEY -> check_api_key() -> click.echo() -> sys.exit()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard environment variable check and error reporting",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a function to verify if an environment variable 'REFACTORAI_API_KEY' is set, and outputs an error message if not. It terminates execution when the key is missing. No malicious or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The use of environment variables for API keys is standard practice. The error handling is straightforward and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic environment variable check with proper error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
