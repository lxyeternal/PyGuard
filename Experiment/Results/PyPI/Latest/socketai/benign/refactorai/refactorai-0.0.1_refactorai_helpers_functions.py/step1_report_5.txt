  "purpose": "The code checks for the presence of an API key environment variable and exits if it is not set.",
  "sources": "Reading the environment variable 'REFACTORAI_API_KEY' using os.getenv()",
  "sinks": "The click.echo() function outputs an error message; sys.exit() terminates the program if the environment variable is not set",
  "flows": "Source: os.getenv('REFACTORAI_API_KEY') -> Sink: click.echo() and sys.exit() when API key is missing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs a straightforward environment variable check without suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, sys, and click modules. It defines a function 'check_api_key' which retrieves the 'REFACTORAI_API_KEY' from environment variables. If the key is absent, it outputs an error message and terminates the program. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic present. The code's intent appears to be to enforce API key presence before proceeding, which is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple environment variable check with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It ensures the API key is set before continuing, aligning with good security practices.",
