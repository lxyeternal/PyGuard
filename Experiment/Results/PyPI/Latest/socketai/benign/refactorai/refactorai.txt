      "conclusion": "The import statement itself is benign but risky in practice due to the use of 'import *'. No evidence of malicious behavior is present in this snippet. Further inspection of the 'starts' module is necessary to confirm security, but based solely on this line, the code is safe. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a slight concern (risk score ~0.2) due to the import style."

      "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears benign. The primary security concern relates to the external AI client's behavior, which cannot be assessed here. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The assigned scores are appropriate, with low malware and obfuscation scores and a low to moderate risk score due to external data handling potential."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a typical API client with no explicit malicious activity. The main concern is the use of an unusual API URL ('https://api.deepseek.com') and logging input data, which could be exploited or leak sensitive information. The malware score remains at 0, but the security risk score should be increased to approximately 0.5 to reflect these suspicions. No obfuscation detected. Overall, the code is benign but warrants caution regarding the custom API endpoint and logging practices."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured API client with a minor configuration mistake that does not pose security risks. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are detected. The low security risk score is appropriate. Correcting the 'response_format' parameter would improve correctness but is not critical for security."
