  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical API client with no explicit malicious activity. The main concern is the use of an unusual API URL ('https://api.deepseek.com') and logging input data, which could be exploited or leak sensitive information. The malware score remains at 0, but the security risk score should be increased to approximately 0.5 to reflect these suspicions. No obfuscation detected. Overall, the code is benign but warrants caution regarding the custom API endpoint and logging practices."
