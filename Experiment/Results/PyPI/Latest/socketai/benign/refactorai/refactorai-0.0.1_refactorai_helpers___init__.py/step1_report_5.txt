{
  "purpose": "Import all functions from a local module named 'functions'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a local module file 'functions.py' via import statement.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this single line of code; no data output or external effect occurs here.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data movement is indicated in this statement alone.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a wildcard import, which can obscure the origin and behavior of imported functions, but this alone is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a module import using a wildcard, which is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious. Without additional context or code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious payloads. The import may be used to execute functions that could be malicious, but this cannot be determined from this single line.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, though the use of wildcard import is a bad practice for code clarity and maintenance.",
