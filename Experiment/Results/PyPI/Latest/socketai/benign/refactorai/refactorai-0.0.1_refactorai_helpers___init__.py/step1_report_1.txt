  "purpose": "Import all functions from a local module named 'functions'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'functions' module from the current package.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, functions imported could be used as sinks if they handle untrusted data, but this is not shown here.",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible in this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement alone is trivial; no anomalies or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "This code imports everything from a local module called 'functions'. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious activity. The import is standard Python syntax. No embedded secrets, obfuscated code, or external network interactions are evident in this single line. The security implications depend on what 'functions' does, but as presented, this line alone appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple import statement with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard Python code for module import.",
