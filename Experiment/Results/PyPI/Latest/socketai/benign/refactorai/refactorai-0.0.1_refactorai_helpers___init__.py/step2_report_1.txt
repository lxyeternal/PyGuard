  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code with the described issues, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same code: `from .functions import *`\n- This is a standard relative import of all functions from a local module named `functions`.\n- The code snippet itself is benign; it does not perform any malicious activity, network communication, or data handling.\n- The main concern with such code is the use of wildcard import (`*`), which can obscure what is imported and potentially hide malicious functions or unintended behavior if the `functions` module is compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Issue confirmation:** The code matches the description; no issues are present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly assesses the code as benign.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Issue confirmation:** Same code, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (slightly above zero due to wildcard import concerns). This is reasonable.\n- **Note:** The report mentions that wildcard import can obscure imported functions but is not malicious. The security risk score of 0.1 is justified.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Issue confirmation:** Same code, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. Slightly higher due to the potential for obscured behavior.\n- **Note:** The report appropriately notes that more context is needed.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Issue confirmation:** Same as above.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Note:** Recognizes that wildcard import is risky for clarity but not malicious.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Issue confirmation:** Same code, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Note:** Consistent with previous assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Malware score assessment:\n- All reports assign malware=0, which is correct given the code snippet.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior is present in the import statement itself.\n\n### Obfuscated score:\n- All reports assign obfuscated=0, which is correct.\n- The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n### Risk score:\n- The risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), mainly due to the use of wildcard import, which can hide malicious code if the `functions` module is compromised.\n- These are reasonable given only this line, but in a real scenario, the risk could be higher if the `functions` module is untrusted.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code snippet.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided information.\n- The main concern remains the use of wildcard import, which should be discouraged in production code for clarity and security.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (considering the potential for obscured malicious code in the imported module)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign but uses a wildcard import, which is a poor practice and could potentially hide malicious code if the `functions` module is compromised. The current scores are appropriate, but in a more critical security context, the risk score could be slightly higher if the origin of `functions` is untrusted.\n\n**Note:** Always review the contents of the `functions` module for malicious code, especially when wildcard imports are used.",
