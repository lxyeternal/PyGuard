  "purpose": "To import all functions from a local module named 'functions' using a wildcard import.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no other data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external data sinks are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process data or perform data flow operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*'), which can obscure imported functions and reduce code clarity; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement. All reviews correctly identify that this line is benign and syntactically correct. The main concern is the use of wildcard import, which is discouraged for maintainability and clarity but does not inherently introduce security risks. Scores assigned across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the analysis, reflecting a low but notable concern about obscured code. No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities is present. The confidence levels are appropriate given the limited context. The overall assessment aligns with best practices, emphasizing that the primary issue is coding style rather than security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and does not exhibit malicious behavior. The use of wildcard import is a best practice concern but not a security issue. The scores and assessments across reports are appropriate and consistent. No further action is necessary beyond noting the import style.",
