  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .functions import *\n```\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the issues are present in the code**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that this is a simple import statement. No code beyond this line is provided, so no direct malicious activity can be confirmed or denied solely based on this.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the reasoning and conclusions**\n\n- All reports correctly note that this is a wildcard import from a local module, which can be discouraged for clarity but is not inherently malicious.\n- No reports mention any embedded secrets, obfuscation, network activity, or other suspicious behavior in this line.\n- The analysis correctly states that without additional context, the import appears benign.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores and their reasonableness**\n\n- **Confidence scores** range from 0.6 to 0.9, which seems appropriate given the limited context.\n- **Malware scores** are all 0, which aligns with the assessment that no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Security risk scores** are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting that the import alone doesn't pose significant security risks, though wildcard imports can obscure code behavior.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any higher risk or malware scores**\n\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n- The risk scores are low but acknowledge that wildcard imports can reduce code clarity and potentially hide malicious code if the imported module is compromised. However, without evidence, these are precautionary considerations rather than confirmed risks.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge assumptions and ensure consistency**\n\n- The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious intent solely based on the import statement.\n- They note that the real risk depends on the contents of the 'functions' module, which is not provided.\n\n**Step 6: Final assessment**\n\n- Based on the provided code snippet and reports, I agree with the assessments that this import statement alone is benign.\n- The use of wildcard import ('*') is generally discouraged, but it does not constitute malicious behavior.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, due to wildcard import's potential for obscuring code behavior, but not inherently risky)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are consistent and reasonable. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. Without additional context or code, there is no indication of supply chain compromise or malicious activity.",
