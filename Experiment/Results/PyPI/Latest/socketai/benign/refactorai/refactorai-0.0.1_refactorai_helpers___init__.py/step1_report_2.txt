  "purpose": "Import all functions from the local module named 'functions'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'functions' located in the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is visible in this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a wildcard import, which can obscure which functions or variables are imported, but this is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code is a straightforward import statement from a local module. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or other operations that could be malicious. The use of 'from .functions import *' may be discouraged for code clarity but is not malicious by itself. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. Given only this line, there is no evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent. It does not introduce security risks on its own, but wildcard imports can hinder code clarity.",
