  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured API client with a minor configuration mistake that does not pose security risks. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are detected. The low security risk score is appropriate. Correcting the 'response_format' parameter would improve correctness but is not critical for security."
