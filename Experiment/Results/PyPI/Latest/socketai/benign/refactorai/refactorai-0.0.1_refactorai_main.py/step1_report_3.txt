  "sources": "helpers.check_api_key() call, os.path.isdir(), os.path.isfile(), core.start_single_file()",
  "sinks": "helpers.check_api_key() function, print statements, click.echo for output",
  "flows": "Input from command line options flows into API key validation and file/directory handling; data may flow into core.start_single_file()",
  "anomalies": "Use of check_api_key() suggests API key validation, but the implementation details are not shown; no evident hardcoded secrets or unusual code; no suspicious network activity or code injection observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a CLI interface with command groups and options, calling helper functions for API key verification and core functions for processing files. The only sensitive operation is the API key check, which is standard for authenticated operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or backdoors. The functions invoked are external or imported modules whose behavior is not shown, but their usage appears straightforward. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are detected. Overall, the code appears to be a standard CLI tool with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a CLI frontend for a refactoring tool, performing standard validation and file handling. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks are evident from the provided code snippet.",
