  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for an AI-driven refactoring tool, facilitating file/directory processing and API key validation.",
  "sources": "User input paths, API key validation via helpers.check_api_key()",
  "sinks": "Console output, external function calls (helpers.check_api_key(), core.start_single_file())",
  "flows": "Input path -> helpers.check_api_key() -> core.start_single_file() (for files) -> console output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard CLI structure, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface built with click, calling external modules for API key validation and file processing. No malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity is present. External functions' implementations are unknown but appear standard. The code handles user input, validates API keys, and processes files or directories, with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. External dependencies are potential points of concern but are typical for such tools; without their implementation, no malicious activity can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI wrapper for an AI refactoring tool, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
