  "purpose": "CLI tool for AI-driven code refactoring and analysis.",
  "sources": "Input parameters from command-line options, environment variables via helpers.check_api_key().",
  "sinks": "Potential API key retrieval, printing messages to console, calling core.start_single_file().",
  "flows": "Command-line inputs -> helpers.check_api_key() -> core.start_single_file() -> output/display.",
  "anomalies": "Use of helpers.check_api_key() suggests handling of API keys but not necessarily malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a CLI with commands 'run' and 'check', which interact with external helper functions and core logic. The API key is checked via helpers.check_api_key(), which could potentially retrieve secrets, but details of its implementation are unknown. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious code is visible. The main security concern could be the handling of API keys, but this is standard practice. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard CLI for AI code refactoring, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The handling of API keys warrants secure management but is not inherently malicious. Overall, the code is benign based on the provided snippet.",
