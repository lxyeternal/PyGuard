  "purpose": "Enum class defining a constant prompt for code refactoring instructions.",
  "sources": "Definition of Enum class, class attributes, and string content for the prompt.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input/output, no external network or file operations, no command execution.",
  "flows": "Constant string assigned to Enum member; no data flow from external sources or to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior. The code is a straightforward Enum class with descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class named AIPrompts with a single member DEFAULT_REFACTOR, which contains a detailed prompt string for refactoring Python code. The class and its member are properly structured. The string itself appears to be a static template and contains no executable code or external data handling. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The content is purely a static data structure meant for prompting AI models. No obfuscated code, malicious intent, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured Enum class used for storing a prompt template. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements. It functions as a static data holder for prompts and does not perform any operations that could pose security risks.",
