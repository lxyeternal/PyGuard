  "purpose": "Enum class defining various AI prompt templates for code refactoring and instructions.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, string literals for prompts, and imports the Enum class.",
  "sinks": "No external data or untrusted input processing; only class and string definitions.",
  "flows": "Definition of enum members with string prompts; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enumeration for AI prompts, specifically for code refactoring tasks. It uses standard Python features such as Enum and string literals. No user input, network operations, or data processing is present. The string content is prompt templates and does not contain executable or malicious code. There are no signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The code appears straightforward, well-structured, and solely focused on defining constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign enum class holding AI prompt templates with no malicious intent or security issues identified.",
