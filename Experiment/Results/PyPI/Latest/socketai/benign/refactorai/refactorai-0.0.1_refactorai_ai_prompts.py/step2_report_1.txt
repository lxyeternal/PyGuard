  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a static Enum class defining prompt templates for AI code refactoring.\n- The code consists solely of class definitions, string literals, and comments.\n- No user input, external data processing, network activity, or code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- The purpose appears to be to serve as configuration or prompt templates for an AI system.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is a static Enum class with string prompts. No issues such as malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n\n- **Any errors or flawed reasoning?**  \n  No. All reports logically conclude that the code is benign and purely declarative.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is appropriate. The code does not contain any malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `obfuscated: 0`, which is correct. The code is straightforward.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign `securityRisk: 0`, consistent with the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign `securityRisk` as 0, which is reasonable.\n\n**Any suggested changes?**  \nNo. The scores are consistent with the code's static and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Potential assumptions or claims:**  \n  The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious intent. They recognize the code as static data, with no signs of hidden behavior.\n\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities:**  \n  None of the reports suggest vulnerabilities; they all agree the code is safe.\n\n- **Is the reasoning sound?**  \n  Yes. The reasoning is consistent and well-justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, the code appears to be a straightforward, static Enum class used to store AI prompt templates. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior is present.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Score Type      | Reasoning                                                                 |\n|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**    | 0 — No malicious code or behavior.                                       |\n| **Obfuscated** | 0 — Clear, readable static code with no obfuscation.                     |\n| **Risk**       | 0 — No security risk, as the code is purely declarative.                |\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is benign, static, and intended as a prompt template.\n- All scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores are justified, and the reasoning is sound.",
