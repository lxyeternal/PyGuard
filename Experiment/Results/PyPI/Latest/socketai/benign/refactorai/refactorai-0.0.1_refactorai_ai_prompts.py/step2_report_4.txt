  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to identify any issues, inconsistencies, or potential security concerns.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code defines an Enum class `AIPrompts` with a single member `DEFAULT_REFACTOR`.\n- The member contains a multi-line string that serves as a prompt template for AI code refactoring, including instructions, JSON input/output structure, and examples.\n- The code is static, with no dynamic execution, input handling, or external data processing.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code appears straightforward and well-structured.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  The reports correctly identify the code as benign, static, and purpose-specific.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk)?**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risk as 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Each Report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states the code defines an enum for AI prompts with no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully benign, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**No issues.**\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly notes static class with prompt template, no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, confident.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**No issues.**\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Accurately describes the enum with a detailed prompt string, static content, no external data handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**No issues.**\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the class and its static string prompt, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, static configuration.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**No issues.**\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above, straightforward static prompt template.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, no malicious signals.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**No issues.**\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations:\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which matches the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n- **Any potential for higher risk?**  \n  No. The code contains only static string data and enum definitions, with no executable or external data handling.\n\n- **Is there any assumption that could be challenged?**  \n  No. The reports do not assume malicious intent; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, static, and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n**In conclusion,** the code is a benign, static configuration class holding prompt templates for AI code refactoring. All scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Work through this step-by-step and confirm that all aspects are thoroughly evaluated.**",
