  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall code review:**\n\n- The code defines a single Enum class `AIPrompts` with one member `DEFAULT_REFACTOR`.\n- The member contains a multi-line string prompt for AI code refactoring, formatted as JSON.\n- The code is static, with no dynamic execution, no user input, no external data processing.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.\n- The code's purpose is to serve as a configuration or prompt template for AI models.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  The reports mainly describe the code as static, benign, and well-structured. No issues or vulnerabilities are detected.  \n  **Yes, the issues (or lack thereof) are accurately reflected.**\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No errors or flaws are evident. The code adheres to Python standards and is straightforward.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and high confidence scores (mostly 1).  \n  These are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code contains no malicious commands, obfuscated code, or backdoors.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0 or very low (e.g., 0.1). This is appropriate; the code is purely static data.\n\n- **Anomalies or suspicious behavior:**  \n  None detected or claimed.\n\n- **Potential assumptions or misinterpretations:**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the string content is a prompt template, not executable code.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent and reasonable. No adjustments needed.\n\n- **Analysis correctness:**  \n  The reports correctly conclude that the code is benign, static, and intended as a prompt template.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close, e.g., 0.1 if considering minimal risk)  \n\nGiven the static nature, I would assign a **risk score of 0**. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a benign, static enum class containing prompt templates. The reports are accurate, and their scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThis code poses no security threat or malicious behavior.",
