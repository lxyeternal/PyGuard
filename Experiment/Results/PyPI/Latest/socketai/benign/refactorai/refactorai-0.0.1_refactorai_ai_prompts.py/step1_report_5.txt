  "purpose": "Enum class defining a JSON-based Python code refactoring prompt with detailed instructions.",
  "sources": "Constant string value assigned to DEFAULT_REFACTOR in the Enum class.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data processing, external inputs, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is purely defining an Enum with a string template.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be straightforward definition of an Enum with a descriptive string.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class 'AIPrompts' with a single member 'DEFAULT_REFACTOR' holding a detailed JSON prompt template for Python code refactoring. The string includes instructions for JSON input/output structure, refactoring guidelines, and example workflows. No user input, data processing, or external connections are present. The code is static and solely serves as a structured prompt template. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign definition of a prompt template for AI code refactoring tasks. It does not contain malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware signals are present.",
