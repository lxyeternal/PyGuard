  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code defines an Enum class (`AIPrompts`) with a single member (`DEFAULT_REFACTOR`) containing a multi-line string prompt.\n   - The code is static, with no dynamic execution, input handling, or external data processing.\n   - The string content is a detailed prompt template for AI code refactoring, including instructions, JSON formats, and examples.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are present.\n   - The code is straightforward, well-structured, and solely serves as a static configuration or prompt holder.\n\n2. **Malware and Security Risk**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious intent or behavior.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or command executions are present.\n   - The content is purely textual prompts stored as string literals.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:\n   - No errors or flaws are evident in the code or its reasoning.\n   - The structure adheres to Python standards, with proper use of Enum and string literals.\n   - The prompt content is detailed and clear, serving its purpose effectively.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - The assigned scores (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), reflecting the clarity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions and Claims**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is static and non-executable.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are unjustified.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a benign, static Enum class containing prompt templates for AI code refactoring.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe code is safe, well-structured, and serves as a static configuration for AI prompts. No further action or concern is warranted.",
