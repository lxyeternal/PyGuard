  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class for AI prompt templates related to code refactoring.",
  "sources": "Reads the Enum class definition, including its docstring and tuple assignments.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data usage detected.",
  "flows": "The code declares static class variables with string content; no data flows from input to output or external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only static class definitions with no dynamic execution, input handling, or code execution. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines an Enum class with a single member that contains a multi-line string with instructions and an example for a code refactoring prompt. There are no apparent code injection points, data leakage mechanisms, or malicious instructions. The structure is static and adheres to typical Python coding standards. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present. The purpose appears to be to serve as a template or configuration for a code refactoring AI.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is benign, serving as a static configuration or template for AI prompts. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies are detected.",
