  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the scoring, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code defines an Enum class `AIPrompts` with a single member `DEFAULT_REFACTOR`.\n- The member contains a multi-line string that is a detailed prompt template for AI-based Python code refactoring.\n- The code is static, with no user input, external data processing, network operations, or executable code.\n- The string content is purely textual instructions and examples.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code defines an enum for AI prompts.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious intent or anomalies.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. The code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, notes static class with prompt template.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, security issues.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Recognizes a prompt template stored in an Enum class.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code, no external data handling.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Notes the constant prompt stored in an Enum class.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static data, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Recognizes the JSON-based prompt template.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static, no malicious code.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is a static Enum class with string prompts. There are no dynamic elements, no external data handling, and no executable code.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They do not overstate the benign nature of the code. No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n  All are zero, which aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  Since all scores are zero, no justification needed.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The code contains only static string data. There is no embedded malicious code, obfuscated payload, or behavior that could be malicious.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n  The code does not process untrusted input, does not execute code dynamically, and does not contain external dependencies or secrets.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a straightforward static class definition used as a template or configuration for AI prompts. It contains no executable code, no external data processing, and no malicious content. The detailed prompt content is static and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **The code is benign, static, and purpose-specific.**  \n- **No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.**  \n- **Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.**  \n- **No changes to the scoring or analysis are necessary.**\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores and conclusions. The code is safe and poses no security threat.",
