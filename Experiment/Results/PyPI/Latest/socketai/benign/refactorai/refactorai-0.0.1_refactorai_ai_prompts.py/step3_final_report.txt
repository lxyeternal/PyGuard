  "purpose": "A static Enum class storing AI prompt templates for code refactoring.",
  "sources": "String literals within the Enum member containing detailed prompt instructions.",
  "sinks": "None; static data with no external input or data flow.",
  "flows": "None; the code is purely declarative with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class 'AIPrompts' with a single member 'DEFAULT_REFACTOR' containing a multi-line string prompt. It serves as a static configuration or template for AI code refactoring tasks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not process external data, execute code dynamically, or include any network or file operations. The prompt content is purely textual and static. All indicators point to benign, static data storage with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static Enum class used for storing AI prompt templates. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with its static and safe nature.",
