  "purpose": "Enum class containing a prompt template for code refactoring instructions.",
  "sources": "Code reads class attributes and comments within the Enum definition.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources; the code is static and defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward Enum class with docstrings and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class 'AIPrompts' with a single member 'DEFAULT_REFACTOR' containing a multi-line string. The string is a detailed prompt for refactoring Python code, including instructions and examples. No external data input, user inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The code appears purely declarative, serving as a configuration or prompt template. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious commands, or obfuscation. The code is simple, static, and contains no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration class used to store a prompt template for AI code refactoring. There are no malicious behaviors, malware, or security risks identified. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
