{
  "purpose": "Convert HDF5 files to markdown documentation format, including file structure, groups, datasets, and attributes.",
  "sources": "Reads local HDF5 files specified by file_path parameter; reads dataset attributes and data values.",
  "sinks": "Writes markdown content to a string and optionally to a file at output_path.",
  "flows": "Reads data from HDF5 file; processes groups, datasets, and attributes; generates markdown; writes output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of external libraries (h5py, numpy) is standard for HDF5 processing.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically processes an HDF5 file to produce a markdown report, handling groups, datasets, and attributes with formatting. No data is sent over the network, nor are there code injection points or obfuscated elements. It reads data from local files and writes formatted output. No suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads is detected. It is a straightforward utility for documentation generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for converting HDF5 files into markdown documentation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks within this module.",
