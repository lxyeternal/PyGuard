  "purpose": "Convert HDF5 files to markdown format by extracting group, dataset, and attribute information.",
  "sources": "Reads the file from a given file path, opens it with h5py.File, and reads dataset attributes and data.",
  "sinks": "Writes markdown content to a string variable and optionally to a file specified by output_path.",
  "flows": "Reads the HDF5 file -> Processes groups and datasets -> Formats and appends information to _output_lines -> Returns or writes markdown content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Uses standard libraries and no external network or system commands.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically processes an HDF5 file structure, extracting metadata and attributes. No code injection, network activity, or malicious data handling observed. The use of h5py is standard for HDF5 file processing. No unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected. The file read operation is straightforward, and output is formatted as markdown. No suspicious data leaks or privacy violations evident. Overall, the code appears to serve a legitimate purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code cleanly converts HDF5 file structures into markdown documentation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. No suspicious activity, malicious code, or obfuscation identified.",
