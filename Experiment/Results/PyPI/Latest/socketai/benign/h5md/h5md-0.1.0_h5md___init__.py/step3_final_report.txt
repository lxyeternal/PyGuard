  "purpose": "Convert HDF5 files to markdown format, documenting structure, attributes, and dataset properties.",
  "sources": "Reads local HDF5 file, groups, datasets, and attributes.",
  "sinks": "Generates markdown string output, optionally writes to file.",
  "flows": "Reads file -> processes groups/datasets/attributes -> formats markdown output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that uses standard libraries (h5py, numpy) to parse HDF5 files and generate markdown documentation. It processes hierarchical groups and datasets, extracting attributes and properties, and formats them into markdown tables with headers indicating depth. No network activity, code injection, or malicious patterns are present. The code does not perform any dangerous operations or handle untrusted data beyond reading local files. The logic is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for documenting HDF5 files. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0, reflecting its safe and purpose-specific nature.",
