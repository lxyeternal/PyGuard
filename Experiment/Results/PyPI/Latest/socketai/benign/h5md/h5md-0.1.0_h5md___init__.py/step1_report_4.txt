  "purpose": "Convert HDF5 files to markdown format for documentation or inspection.",
  "sources": "Reading the HDF5 file via h5py.File, accessing group and dataset attributes and properties.",
  "sinks": "Writing markdown content to an internal string and optionally to a file.",
  "flows": "Reads from the HDF5 file, processes groups, datasets, and attributes, then generates markdown output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. No network activity or system modifications observed. Code appears to perform straightforward file reading and string processing.",
  "analysis": "The code sequentially opens an HDF5 file, traverses its groups and datasets, and formats their attributes and properties into markdown. The methods use standard h5py and numpy functions with no external data sources or untrusted inputs explicitly handled. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious logic detected. The code does not perform any network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration. It solely reads and formats data for documentation purposes. Overall, the script seems purely functional and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for converting HDF5 file structure into markdown documentation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided implementation.",
