  "purpose": "Command-line tool for converting HDF5 files to markdown format using the HDF5Converter library.",
  "sources": "Input file specified by user via command-line argument; system environment variables for Python execution.",
  "sinks": "File system when reading input and writing output; error messages printed to stderr.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> check existence -> converter.convert() -> output file creation",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments to identify input and optional output files, checks for input file existence, and invokes a conversion method. Error handling is standard, printing messages and exiting. No user input is directly executed as code, no network activity, and no sensitive data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard file conversion script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on the trusted HDF5Converter library for processing, which is not inherently suspicious. No indicators of sabotage or malware are present.",
