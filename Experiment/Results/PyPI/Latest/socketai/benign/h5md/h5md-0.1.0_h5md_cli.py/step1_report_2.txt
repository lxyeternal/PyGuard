  "purpose": "Command-line tool for converting HDF5 files to markdown format using the HDF5Converter library.",
  "sources": "Input file path provided via command-line argument; Path object checks file existence.",
  "sinks": "Conversion function call (converter.convert) with input and output paths; print statements for success or error messages.",
  "flows": "User provides input filename -> check file exists -> determine output path -> instantiate converter -> perform conversion -> output success/error message.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code, and no unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts an input file path, verifies its existence, and calls an external library function to convert the file. Error handling is straightforward, printing messages to standard error. No untrusted data is used insecurely; the code performs standard input validation and error handling. The 'HDF5Converter' library is assumed to be benign as per provided context. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate command-line utility for file conversion, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. It relies on an external library and performs basic input validation and exception handling.",
