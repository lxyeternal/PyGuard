  "purpose": "Command-line tool to convert HDF5 files to markdown format using the h5md library",
  "sources": "User provides input filename via command-line argument; reads the file path from sys.argv",
  "sinks": "File existence check, file path used for conversion, output file path, exception handling",
  "flows": "Input argument -> file existence check -> HDF5Converter.convert() method",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected; standard file processing and argument parsing",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments, verifies input file existence, and calls a conversion method. It handles exceptions gracefully, printing errors to stderr. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity is present. The use of an external library (h5md) is not suspicious by itself. The logic is straightforward and intended for data format conversion. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign command-line utility for converting HDF5 files to markdown, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
