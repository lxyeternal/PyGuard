  "purpose": "Command-line tool to convert HDF5 files to markdown format using the HDF5Converter library.",
  "sources": "Reads input file path from command-line arguments, checks if file exists.",
  "sinks": "Uses HDF5Converter to perform conversion; prints success or error messages.",
  "flows": "Input file path -> file existence check -> HDF5Converter.convert() -> output path -> success/error message",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. The code properly handles file existence and exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward command-line utility that takes a filename, checks its existence, determines an output filename if not specified, and calls a library method to perform conversion. It includes proper exception handling and input validation. No untrusted data is used in unsafe ways, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code injection. The use of the HDF5Converter library appears legitimate and intended for data conversion. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI utility with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It safely handles inputs and uses a third-party library for conversion. No security risks are detected.",
