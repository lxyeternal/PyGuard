  "purpose": "Command-line utility to convert HDF5 files to markdown format using the HDF5Converter library.",
  "sources": "Input filename provided via command-line argument; file existence check.",
  "sinks": "Calling the external HDF5Converter().convert() method; no untrusted data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Input filename read from arguments -> file existence validation -> converter.convert() called with input and output paths.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI script that validates input, determines output filename, and invokes an external library for conversion. It handles errors gracefully and does not perform any network activity or data leaks. The external library is assumed benign. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The code's structure and logic are standard and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. External library trust is assumed. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1 due to minimal operational risk, which is justified given the context.",
