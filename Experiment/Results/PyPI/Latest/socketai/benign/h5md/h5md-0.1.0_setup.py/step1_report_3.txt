  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'h5md' Python tool, including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the 'README.md' file read for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could cause harm; no network or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "No complex data flows; primarily static configuration data for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without context management (no 'with' statement) for reading 'README.md', which is not suspicious but slightly unconventional; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and console entry points. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is present. The only notable aspect is reading 'README.md' without proper file handling best practices, but this does not imply malicious intent. No external or untrusted data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical package configuration with no suspicious anomalies.",
