  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'h5md' Python package, providing installation requirements, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Read the long_description from 'README.md', read author email, and package dependencies from 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - straightforward package setup without untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs. The code adheres to standard setup script conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'find_packages' and 'setup' from setuptools, then calls setup() with package metadata including name, version, license files, packages, requirements, entry points, and other metadata. It reads the long description directly from 'README.md', which is standard. No user input or untrusted data sources are involved. The code structure is typical for Python packaging scripts and contains no suspicious behavior or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
