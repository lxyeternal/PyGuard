      "conclusion": "The package exhibits behaviors consistent with potential privacy invasion or data exfiltration, especially given the automatic data collection during install and CLI exposure. While no explicit malicious code is visible, the pattern is suspicious enough to warrant further review of the collect_data() implementation. The malware score is set high due to the potential for malicious activity, and the security risk score reflects significant concern over data privacy. Overall, the package should be treated with caution until the behavior of collect_data() is verified."
