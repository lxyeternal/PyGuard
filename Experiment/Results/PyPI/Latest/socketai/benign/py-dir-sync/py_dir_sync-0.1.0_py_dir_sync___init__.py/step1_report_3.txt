{
  "purpose": "This module appears to define and export various classes, functions, and constants related to file synchronization, filtering, matching, and watching. It likely supports a larger file management or synchronization system.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and functions from local relative files, reading source code definitions and potentially configuration data from those modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks such as network, file writing, or environment variable modifications that could be exploited for malicious data leaks or control.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow paths are apparent within this snippet; it only imports and re-exports functions and classes without executing untrusted code or handling input directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior are present. The code strictly imports and exports symbols, with no dynamic execution, obfuscated patterns, or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports functions and classes from local modules and defines the __all__ list for module exports. It does not perform any runtime operations, data processing, or untrusted input handling. No anomalies or malicious constructs are detected. It appears to be a standard module interface file for a larger package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module that organizes and exports components related to file synchronization and monitoring. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
