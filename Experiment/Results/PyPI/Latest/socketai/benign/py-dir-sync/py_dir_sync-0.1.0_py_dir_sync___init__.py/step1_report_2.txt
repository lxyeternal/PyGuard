  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a file synchronization or watcher library, defining imports and exports for various components such as filters, handlers, matchers, synchronization logic, utilities, and watchers.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in this snippet; it only imports modules and defines exports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects are present; the code mainly imports functions and classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code structure is straightforward, importing and exporting modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely import/export statements, establishing the API for a larger package. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as network access, system modification, or obfuscated code, are present. The structure suggests a well-organized module export setup typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code snippet. It functions as a simple module interface declaration with no apparent security issues.",
