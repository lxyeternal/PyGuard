{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or index file that imports various classes and functions related to file synchronization, filtering, handling, and watching, and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data only through static import statements from internal modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external data output.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code does not handle data at runtime, only organizes exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer that imports classes and functions from internal modules and defines __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. The code's purpose is purely organizational, serving as an API surface for a larger package. Given the absence of data handling, external interactions, or suspicious constructs, there are no security concerns or malicious behaviors present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
