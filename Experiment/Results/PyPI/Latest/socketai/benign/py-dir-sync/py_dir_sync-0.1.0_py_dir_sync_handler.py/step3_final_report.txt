  "purpose": "File synchronization and event handling for creating, modifying, moving, and deleting files/directories, maintaining directory structure integrity.",
  "sources": "Filesystem paths accessed during file operations, directory reads, and error handling logs.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem modifications such as copying, moving, deleting files/directories, and error logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Input paths are used in copy/move/delete functions; errors trigger error handler and potential retries; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual logic detected; standard filesystem operations and error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard filesystem event handling with proper error management, directory cleanup, and synchronization logic. It uses common Python libraries and custom modules for scheduling and utilities. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or network activity are present. The security implications are minimal, limited to filesystem operations, which are typical for such utilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward file synchronization handler with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the code appears safe for use. The scores and assessments provided are justified and accurate.",
