  "purpose": "Filename pattern matching utility to include or exclude files based on patterns.",
  "sources": "Pattern list validated via validate_strings; filename input in include() and exclude() methods.",
  "sinks": "Pattern matching with fnmatch, which is safe; no data leaks or untrusted code execution.",
  "flows": "Patterns validated -> pattern matched against filename in include/exclude methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of filename filtering using fnmatch, with pattern validation. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. External validate_strings function is assumed safe. No network, data exfiltration, or code injection observed. The pattern matching is standard and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard filename filtering, and poses no security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
