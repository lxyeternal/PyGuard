  "purpose": "Utility class for filename pattern matching using fnmatch, to include or exclude files based on patterns.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'patterns' from constructor, method parameters 'path' in exclude and include methods.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leakage or malicious effects; no external output, network calls, or file writes.",
  "flows": "Patterns are validated and stored; 'exclude' and 'include' methods use 'fnmatch' to match 'path' against stored patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The code performs standard pattern matching without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The class initializes with pattern validation, provides methods to check if a filename should be excluded or included based on patterns. Uses 'fnmatch' for pattern matching, which is standard. No external inputs besides 'patterns' and 'path'. No unsafe operations or hidden behaviors. The code appears benign and solely intended for filename filtering.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward filename pattern matching utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard pattern matching and validation, with no evidence of malicious behavior.",
