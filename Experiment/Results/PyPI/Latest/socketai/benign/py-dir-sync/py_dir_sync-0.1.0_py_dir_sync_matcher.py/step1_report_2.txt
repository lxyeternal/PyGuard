  "purpose": "A class for matching filenames against patterns using fnmatch, supporting inclusion and exclusion logic.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'patterns' in __init__, 'path' arguments in exclude() and include() methods.",
  "sinks": "Pattern matching functions (fnmatch), pattern validation via validate_strings.",
  "flows": "Patterns are validated and stored; 'path' inputs are matched against these patterns in exclude() and include().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures; the code appears to be a straightforward filename matching utility.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes with optional patterns, validates them, and provides methods to determine if a filename should be included or excluded based on pattern matching. It uses standard Python libraries and a custom validate_strings function. No input/output operations or network activity are present. No evidence of data leakage, obfuscation, or malicious behavior was detected. The pattern matching and validation are standard practices for filename filtering.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a filename filter utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign component intended for pattern matching purposes.",
