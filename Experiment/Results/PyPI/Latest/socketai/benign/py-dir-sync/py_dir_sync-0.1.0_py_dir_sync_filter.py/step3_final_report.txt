  "purpose": "Path filtering utility that includes or excludes files and directories based on pattern matchers.",
  "sources": "Paths provided to match functions, pattern matchers 'exclude' and 'include'.",
  "sinks": "Return values of match_relative_path and match functions, which output relative paths or None.",
  "flows": "Paths are normalized relative to base; pattern matchers determine inclusion/exclusion; results are returned accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Error handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward path filtering using pattern matchers, normalizes paths, and handles exceptions with logging. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. External matchers are assumed to be standard pattern matchers without malicious intent. The logic is clear and secure, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1), consistent with benign pattern filtering utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard path filtering utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The provided reports are accurate and appropriately score the security posture as minimal risk.",
