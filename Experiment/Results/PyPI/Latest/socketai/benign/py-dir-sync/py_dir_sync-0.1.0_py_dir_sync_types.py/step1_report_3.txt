  "purpose": "Define data structures and protocol for handling file change events.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points where untrusted data could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines types and protocol.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a TypedDict for representing file change sets and a Protocol for a handler to process such events. It uses standard Python typing and pathlib without dynamic code execution, external input handling, or network operations. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type and protocol definition for file change handling, with no malicious or suspicious elements. It appears safe and aligned with normal coding practices.",
