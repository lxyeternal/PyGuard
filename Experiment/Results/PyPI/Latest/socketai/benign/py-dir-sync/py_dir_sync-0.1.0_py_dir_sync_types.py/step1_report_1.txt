  "purpose": "Define data structures and protocols for handling file change events.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input, only defines classes and types.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data flows or processing functions that act on untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no executable logic or data flow processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code only defines data types and a protocol.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a TypedDict for representing file change information, and a Protocol for handling change events. No user input, network operations, or data manipulation occurs. There are no hardcoded secrets, external data sources, or dangerous functions. The structure appears to be part of a larger application for file monitoring, but on its own, it poses no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a data and interface definition for a file change handler.",
