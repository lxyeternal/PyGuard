  "purpose": "Define data structures and protocols for tracking file changes and handling file change events.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or execute dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only declares types and protocols.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for type annotations and a protocol for file change handling. It uses standard libraries and typing constructs without executing or manipulating data at runtime. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. The purpose appears to be type safety and interface design for file monitoring, with no input/output or external data processing present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of data types and a protocol for file change events with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
