  "purpose": "Defines data structures and protocols for handling file change events in a file monitoring system.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code only defines types and interfaces.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is purely structural with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, using standard Python constructs without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static definition of a TypedDict and a Protocol for file change event handling. It does not perform any runtime operations, external data handling, or network communication. The code is free of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No logical flaws or security issues are present. The code's purpose is purely structural, serving as part of a larger system, and poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and free of malicious behavior or security risks. The reports correctly assess the code as safe, with scores of zero across malware, obfuscation, and security risk. No modifications are necessary.",
