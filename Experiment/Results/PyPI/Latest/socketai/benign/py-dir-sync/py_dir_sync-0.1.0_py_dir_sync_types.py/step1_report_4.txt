  "purpose": "Define data structures and protocols for tracking file change events and handling file change notifications.",
  "sources": "None (no input sources like user input, network, or environment variables).",
  "sinks": "None (no output or untrusted data handling observed).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow between sources and sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be straightforward type and protocol definitions with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type annotations and a protocol for handling file changes, including creating, modifying, deleting, and moving files, along with error handling. All constructs are standard Python features: TypedDict, Protocol, and type hints. There are no dynamic code executions, external data processing, or network interactions. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of data structure definitions and an interface protocol for file change event handling. There is no indication of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
