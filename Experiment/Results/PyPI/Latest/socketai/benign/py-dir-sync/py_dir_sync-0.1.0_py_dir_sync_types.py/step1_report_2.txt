  "purpose": "Define data structures and a protocol for handling file change events.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; code defines classes and protocols.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code is purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a TypedDict 'ChangeFiles' to represent file change states and a 'ChangeHandler' Protocol for handling file change events with various optional parameters. The code imports standard libraries without any suspicious or obfuscated elements. There are no dynamic code execution, external communications, or embedded secrets. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward, non-malicious structural definition for a file change event handler.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely structural and does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is intended for event handling and data modeling related to file system changes.",
