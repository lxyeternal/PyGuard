  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package and execute the CLI command.",
  "sources": "Import statements for core and cli modules.",
  "sinks": "The 'cli()' function call may execute code that could be a sink if it processes untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Import core and cly modules -> execute cli() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports. The code is minimal and standard for a package entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions/modules: 'greet' from 'core' and 'cli' from 'cly'. It then calls 'cli()', which presumably starts the command-line interface. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The structure is typical for a package entry point. No anomalies or unusual constructs are present. The only notable aspect is the immediate execution of 'cli()', which is standard for CLI tools, but it depends on 'cli()' implementation for security, which is outside this scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical package initialization script that runs the CLI entry point. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks within this fragment. It is straightforward and does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
