  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by importing modules and executing the CLI function.",
  "sources": "Import statements for .core and .cly modules, and the call to cli().",
  "sinks": "The call to cli() potentially executes user or external input if it processes command-line arguments or scripts.",
  "flows": "Import of modules followed by immediate execution of cli(), which may process input arguments or scripts.",
  "anomalies": "The code immediately calls cli() without any input validation, which could be suspicious if cli() executes untrusted code or commands.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two modules, which is standard. The immediate invocation of cli() is typical for command-line interfaces, but without knowing what cli() does, there's potential concern if it handles untrusted input without validation. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are visible. The code itself is minimal and standard for CLI applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical package initialization script that runs a CLI. There is no explicit malicious behavior, but depending on what cli() does, there could be risks if it processes untrusted input improperly. Overall, low suspicion based on the provided code.",
