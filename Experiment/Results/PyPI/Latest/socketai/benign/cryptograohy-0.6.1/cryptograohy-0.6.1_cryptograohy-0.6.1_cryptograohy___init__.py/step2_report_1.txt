  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n```python\n# asciidrawing/__init__.py\n\nfrom .core import greet\nfrom .cly import cli\n\ncli()\n```\n\nThis code imports two functions: `greet` from `core` and `cli` from `cly`, then immediately calls `cli()` during module import.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious imports.\n- The immediate invocation of `cli()` at import time is standard for CLI entry points but can be problematic if the module is imported in an unintended context.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **Potential design concern:** Calling `cli()` at import time can cause unexpected behavior if the module is imported programmatically rather than run as a script. This could lead to unintentional command execution.\n- **No evidence of malicious code** (e.g., backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity) in this snippet.\n\n### Evaluation of Reports:\n- All reports agree that the code appears typical for a CLI package, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The main concern across reports is the immediate call to `cli()` during import, which could be risky if `cli()` executes untrusted input or commands.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code snippet.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, correct given the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** Slight variation but generally low (0.1 to 0.2). This seems appropriate given the immediate call to `cli()`, which could be risky if `cli()` is insecure, but no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- The risk score is low (0.1-0.2). Since the code is standard and no malicious activity is detected, these scores are reasonable.\n- The main concern is the design pattern, not malicious intent.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (standard pattern with a minor concern about immediate execution)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nConsidering all the points, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.15 (moderate but not significant)\n\nThis reflects the standard pattern but notes the potential issue with immediate `cli()` invocation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is typical for a CLI package's entry point.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident.\n- The main concern is the immediate execution of `cli()` during import, which could be problematic if `cli()` handles untrusted input insecurely, but this cannot be confirmed from the snippet alone.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.",
