  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI package entry point with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main concern is the immediate call to 'cli()' during import, which could be risky if 'cli()' executes untrusted commands. Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2). It is advisable to review the implementation of 'cli()' to ensure safety, but based on this snippet, the code is benign."
