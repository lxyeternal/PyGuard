  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code and the provided assessments, and then synthesize an overall evaluation.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n```python\n# asciidrawing/__init__.py\n\nfrom .core import greet\nfrom .cly import cli\n\ncli()\n```\n\n**Key points:**\n- Imports `greet` from `.core` and `cli` from `.cly`.\n- Immediately calls `cli()` at import time.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is straightforward; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious imports are present.\n- The immediate invocation of `cli()` during import is notable. While common in CLI scripts, it can be risky if `cli()` executes untrusted input or commands.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws are evident in the code snippet itself.\n- The main concern is that `cli()` is called during import, which could lead to unintended command execution if the module is imported in an environment where `cli()` performs dangerous operations. This pattern is typical for CLI entry points but can be considered poor practice if the module is imported elsewhere unintentionally.\n\n### Review of each report:\nAll reports consistently state that:\n- The code is standard for CLI tools.\n- No malicious code or obfuscation is evident.\n- The primary concern is the immediate call to `cli()`, which could execute untrusted code depending on its implementation.\n\n### Scores and their justification:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security Risk:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low but non-zero concern about executing `cli()` immediately.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The high confidence scores (0.8 to 1.0) are justified, as the code pattern is consistent across reports.\n- The risk scores could be slightly increased to 0.3 if we consider the potential danger of executing `cli()` at import time, especially if `cli()` handles untrusted input or is maliciously modified.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 to 0.3 (low, but the immediate `cli()` call warrants caution)\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.2 (to reflect the potential risk of executing `cli()` immediately)\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code itself is benign and typical for CLI entry points.  \n- The main concern is the execution of `cli()` during import, which could be exploited if `cli()` is malicious or handles untrusted input insecurely.  \n- No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears standard and safe in its current form, but the pattern of calling `cli()` at import time should be documented or refactored to avoid unintended execution during import in non-standard environments.",
