  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package and execute the command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Importing 'greet' from 'core' and 'cli' from 'cly', then calling 'cli()' immediately.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'cli()' may process untrusted input or execute commands, depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Importing 'cli' and executing 'cli()' directly during module import.",
  "anomalies": "Immediate invocation of 'cli()' at import time, which can lead to unintended execution if imported in a non-standard context.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing functions and executing 'cli()' immediately. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious imports are present. The pattern is typical for CLI entry points but executing 'cli()' during import can be risky if 'cli()' handles untrusted input or performs unsafe operations. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The security risk score is low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting the potential danger of executing 'cli()' immediately. The confidence in these assessments is high, given the simplicity of the code and the absence of suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI package entry point with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main concern is the immediate call to 'cli()' during import, which could be risky if 'cli()' executes untrusted commands. Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2). It is advisable to review the implementation of 'cli()' to ensure safety, but based on this snippet, the code is benign.",
