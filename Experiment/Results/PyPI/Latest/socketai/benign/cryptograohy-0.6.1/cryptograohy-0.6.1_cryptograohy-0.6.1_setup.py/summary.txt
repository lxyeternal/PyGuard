  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with minor suspicious elements such as dependency import during install and exception info leakage. No evidence of malicious activity or malware is detected. The scores of malware 0.2, obfuscated 0, and risk 0.3 are justified; slight caution is advised due to dependency trustworthiness and package name typo."
