  "purpose": "Initialize an emoji converter using the pyprettifier library when the script is run.",
  "sources": "Import statement for pyprettifier; instantiation of pyprettifier.EmojiConverter()",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external effects are present",
  "flows": "Import pyprettifier -> Instantiate pyprettifier.EmojiConverter()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior are observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party library pyprettifier only within the cli() function, then creates an instance of EmojiConverter from that library. The import is local to the function, and there are no other operations or data flows involving external inputs, outputs, or sensitive data. The code appears to serve as a simple command-line interface to initialize the emoji converter. There is no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risk evident in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply initializes a third-party emoji converter library. No anomalies or malware indicators are present.",
