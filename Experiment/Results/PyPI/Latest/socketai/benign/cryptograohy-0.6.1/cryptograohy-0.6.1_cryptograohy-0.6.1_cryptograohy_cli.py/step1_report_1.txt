  "flows": "Import 'pyprettifier' -> create 'EmojiConverter' instance.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party module 'pyprettifier' and creates an object from 'EmojiConverter'. There are no data inputs from untrusted sources, no external data flows, and no suspicious code patterns. The 'cli' function simply initializes an object and terminates. The module 'pyprettifier' might perform internal operations, but nothing in this snippet indicates malicious intent. No malware or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, performing a simple import and object creation with no apparent malicious activity or security risks.",
