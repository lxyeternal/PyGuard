  "purpose": "Minimal code to import a third-party module and instantiate an object, likely for CLI use.",
  "sources": "Import statement within the cli() function.",
  "sinks": "Object instantiation; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Import pyprettifier -> create EmojiConverter instance.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; import is local within function, no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party module and creates an object without processing external data, performing network operations, or handling secrets. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence level is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and reflect the minimal risk. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
