  "purpose": "Initialize and run the CLI function which creates an instance of pyprettifier.EmojiConverter.",
  "sources": "Import statement for pyprettifier and instantiation of EmojiConverter object within the cli() function.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "Import pyprettifier -> create EmojiConverter instance",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs straightforward module import and object instantiation with no additional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party module 'pyprettifier' and creates an instance of 'EmojiConverter' within the cli() function. The function is then invoked immediately. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The use of import within a function is unusual but not malicious. The code appears to be a simple CLI setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal CLI script that imports a library and creates an object. It shows no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
