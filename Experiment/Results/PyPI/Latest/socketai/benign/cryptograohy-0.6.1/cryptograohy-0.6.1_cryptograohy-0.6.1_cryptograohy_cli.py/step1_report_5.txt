  "flows": "Import pyprettifier -> create EmojiConverter instance -> run cli() function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple CLI function that imports a third-party library 'pyprettifier' and creates an instance of 'EmojiConverter'. The function is invoked immediately. No input/output handling, external data transmission, or malicious code is present. The library used appears to be a legitimate emoji processing library, and no suspicious activities are detected in this minimal code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a straightforward CLI setup for the pyprettifier library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
