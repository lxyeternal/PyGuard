  "purpose": "The code initializes a CLI function that imports a module and creates an instance of a class from that module.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'pyprettifier' and instantiation of 'EmojiConverter' class.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data is processed, stored, or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pyprettifier' -> creation of 'EmojiConverter' instance; no further data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only importing and instantiating a class; no suspicious or unusual code features detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a CLI function that imports a third-party module 'pyprettifier' and creates an object 'a' of type 'EmojiConverter'. The import is dynamic and localized within the function. There are no hardcoded credentials, no network communication, no data leaks, and no malicious behaviors. The code appears to be straightforward and benign, serving as a minimal CLI setup or example usage. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears benign, performing a basic import and object instantiation without any malicious intent or security risks.",
