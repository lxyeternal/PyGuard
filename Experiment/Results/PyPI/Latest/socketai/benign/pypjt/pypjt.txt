      "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The external dependency files are the only potential supply chain risk, but the code itself is secure. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is minimal."

      "conclusion": "The script is a benign project scaffolding tool with no malicious intent or activity. The only potential risk relates to template injection if templates are compromised, but this is a common and external concern. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal, mostly theoretical risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The only minor issue is the slicing of 'prod.txt', which may be an oversight rather than malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for aggregating coverage reports. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are appropriate. The low security risk scores are justified given the local file operations and lack of external interactions. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."
