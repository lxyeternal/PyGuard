  "purpose": "Generate an index.html file linking to coverage reports within a specified directory.",
  "sources": "os.listdir(), Path(index_file).read_text() for reading HTML files, user-provided directory path.",
  "sinks": "Path(index_path).write_text() writing the generated HTML index file.",
  "flows": "Reads HTML files from subdirectories -> Parses HTML content with BeautifulSoup -> Extracts coverage info -> Constructs HTML links -> Writes index.html.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors observed. Uses standard libraries and well-known packages.",
  "analysis": "The script reads HTML files from a specified directory to extract coverage percentages and generate an index page linking to these reports. It uses BeautifulSoup to parse HTML safely and writes an output file in the same directory. No untrusted data is executed as code, no network communication or system modifications are performed. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code flows. The code appears straightforward, focused on file I/O and HTML parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script intended for generating a coverage report index. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are identified. It operates purely on local files and outputs a static HTML file.",
