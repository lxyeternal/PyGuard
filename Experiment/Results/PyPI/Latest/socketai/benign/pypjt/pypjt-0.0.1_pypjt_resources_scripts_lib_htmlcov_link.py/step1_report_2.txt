  "purpose": "Generate an index HTML file linking to coverage reports in a specified directory.",
  "sources": "Reading directory contents with os.listdir, reading HTML files with Path.read_text.",
  "sinks": "Writing the generated index.html file to disk with Path.write_text.",
  "flows": "Directory listing -> Read index.html files -> Parse HTML with BeautifulSoup -> Generate links with coverage info -> Write index.html.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Use of BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing is standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a directory of coverage reports, parses each report's index.html to extract coverage percentage, and generates a summary HTML file linking to each report. It uses standard libraries and straightforward logic. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation. The code operates solely on local files, with no external or untrusted input beyond directory listing, which is typical for such tools. The use of BeautifulSoup is for HTML parsing and does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for aggregating coverage reports into an index page. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
