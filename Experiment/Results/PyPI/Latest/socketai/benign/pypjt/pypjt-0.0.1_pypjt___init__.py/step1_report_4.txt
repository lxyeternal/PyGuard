{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'main' function from the 'create' module within the same package, likely used to initiate or run core functionality.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'create' module within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted input or data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only performs a module import.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, straightforward import statement. No unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a 'main' function from a local module named 'create'. There are no inputs, data processing, or output statements. The structure is minimal, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity. Given the limited code, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard module import with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical Python import statement and poses no threat.",
