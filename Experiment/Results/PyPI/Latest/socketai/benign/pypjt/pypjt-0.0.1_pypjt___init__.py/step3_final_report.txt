{
  "purpose": "The code performs a simple relative import of 'main' from a local module named 'create', typical in Python package structure.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code only imports a function from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Import statement does not involve data flow from untrusted sources; static import only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; minimal and straightforward code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard relative import in Python, with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as zero. Confidence in the benign assessment is high due to the simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, typical import statement with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports are accurate and consistent; no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
