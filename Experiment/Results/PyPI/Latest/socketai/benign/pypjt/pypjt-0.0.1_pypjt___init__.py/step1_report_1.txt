{
  "purpose": "Import the main function from the create module, likely for use in a larger application or script.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; only a relative import statement.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling or processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths; only a module import.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code complexity, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns; a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a single import statement using a relative import syntax, importing 'main' from a local module named 'create'. There are no apparent data sources, sinks, or flows. No obfuscated code, secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The code is minimal and standard for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and typical for modular Python codebases. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
