{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python project that dynamically reads dependency requirements from files in a 'requirements' directory to configure installation and extra requirements.",
  "sources": "Reading requirement files ('base.txt', 'prod.txt', 'dev.txt') in the 'requirements' directory.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Reads static files -> processes requirement lists -> passes them to setup() for installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward reading and processing of requirement files; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code reads dependency lists from files, filters and deduplicates them, and supplies them to setuptools.setup(). It does not perform any network activity, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted input. The logic appears correct for managing dependencies. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The external requirement files could be a supply chain concern if compromised, but this is outside the code itself. Overall, the code is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The external dependency files are the only potential supply chain risk, but the code itself is secure. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is minimal.",
