{
  "purpose": "A project scaffolding tool that copies resource templates, renders configuration files with user input, and creates project directories and files.",
  "sources": "User prompts for project name, version, author, email, description; environment variables loaded via dotenv; resource templates in the 'resources' directory.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem operations such as copying directories, creating files, and rendering templates into files.",
  "flows": "User input is used to render templates which are then written to project files; environment variables may influence template rendering; resource files are copied into the project directory.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity. Potential for template injection if templates are malicious, but no actual malicious activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward project scaffolding script. It loads environment variables, prompts the user for project details, copies resource files, creates directories, and renders templates with user input. No code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The only minor concern is the potential for server-side template injection (SSTI) if templates are malicious, but this is a theoretical risk outside the code's current scope. The code uses standard libraries and practices, with no obfuscation or malware signatures.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign project scaffolding tool with no malicious intent or activity. The only potential risk relates to template injection if templates are compromised, but this is a common and external concern. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal, mostly theoretical risk.",
