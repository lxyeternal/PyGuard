{
  "purpose": "The script generates a new project directory with templated configuration files based on user input, including copying resource files and rendering templates.",
  "sources": "User input via click.prompt for project_name, version, author, email, description; environment variables loaded with dotenv; template files in RC_DIR.",
  "sinks": "Writing rendered templates to output files; copying resource directories; creating directories and files on the filesystem.",
  "flows": "User input flows into process() via **kwargs; process() reads input data and copies resources; Renderer renders templates using kwargs; rendered content is written to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. No suspicious network activity or hidden behaviors detected. Usage of environment variables is standard. No data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes environment variables, copies resource files, and renders templates based on user prompts. All user inputs are used to generate project files without direct execution of untrusted data. The code employs standard libraries for filesystem operations and templating. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or unauthorized data exfiltration are present. The process function appears to securely handle file operations. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent. The overall structure is straightforward and adheres to common project scaffolding practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a project scaffolding tool, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It securely handles user input for project setup and performs standard filesystem and templating operations. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
