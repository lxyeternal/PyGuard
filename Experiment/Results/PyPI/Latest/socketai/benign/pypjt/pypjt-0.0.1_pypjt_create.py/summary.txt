  "conclusion": "The script is a benign project scaffolding tool with no malicious intent or activity. The only potential risk relates to template injection if templates are compromised, but this is a common and external concern. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal, mostly theoretical risk."
