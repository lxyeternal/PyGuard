  "purpose": "The script is designed to generate a new project directory with templated configuration files, based on user input.",
  "sources": "User input via click prompts: project_name, version, author, email, description",
  "sinks": "File system operations such as copying templates, writing rendered files, creating directories, and touching files",
  "flows": "User input flows into the process function via kwargs, which is used to render templates and create files in the project directory",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code performs standard templating and file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables, manages project template files, and renders configuration files using Jinja2. User input is collected through click prompts and used solely for project setup. The file operations involve copying templates, creating directories, and rendering files; no untrusted data is executed as code or sent over network. No obfuscated code or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a project scaffolding utility that safely generates project files based on user input. No malicious or suspicious behavior is observed. The overall security risk is negligible.",
