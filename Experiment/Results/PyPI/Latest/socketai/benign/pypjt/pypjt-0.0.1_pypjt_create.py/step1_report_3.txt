{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to generate a new project structure by copying resource templates, rendering templates with user input, and setting up initial files for a Python project.",
  "sources": "User input collected via click.prompt for project name, version, author, email, and description.",
  "sinks": "File operations such as copying resource directories, writing rendered templates to files, and creating directories and files in the project path.",
  "flows": "User inputs are used to render templates that are then written to output files within the created project directory.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed. The code uses standard libraries and well-known third-party libraries (click, dotenv, jinja2). The template rendering appears to be controlled by local resource templates only. No hardcoded secrets or credentials present. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes environment variables, loads resources, and interacts with the filesystem to set up a new project. User input is used to customize rendered templates, but this input is only employed in template rendering without any direct command execution or insecure handling. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code structure is straightforward, with no suspicious logic, external untrusted data handling beyond user prompts, and no malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard project scaffolding tool with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It relies on controlled local templates and user input for rendering, with no evident malicious intent.",
