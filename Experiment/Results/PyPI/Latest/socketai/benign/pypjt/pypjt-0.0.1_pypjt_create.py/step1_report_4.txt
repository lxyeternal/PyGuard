  "purpose": "The script automates project scaffolding by copying resource templates and rendering files with user-provided data to set up a new project directory.",
  "sources": "User input via click.prompt for project name, version, author, email, and description; environment variables loaded via dotenv; resource template files from the 'resources' directory.",
  "sinks": "Writing rendered output to files in the new project directory; copying resource files and templates.",
  "flows": "User input -> process() parameters -> rendering templates -> writing files; environment variables potentially influence rendering if used in templates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Usage of environment variables is standard and limited to loading config. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity is present. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs project scaffolding by copying resources and rendering templates with user input. It loads environment variables, which could influence template rendering if templates utilize these variables, but this is standard practice. The process involves copying files, creating directories, and rendering templates — all typical and safe activities. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network communication. The code is well-structured and adheres to normal practices for such tools.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign project generator with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only interacts with the local filesystem and standard user inputs, with no evidence of backdoors, malware, or security vulnerabilities.",
