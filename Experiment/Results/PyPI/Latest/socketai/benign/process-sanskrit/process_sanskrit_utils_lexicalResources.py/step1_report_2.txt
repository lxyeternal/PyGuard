{
  "purpose": "This code defines various dictionaries and lists related to Sanskrit sandhi rules, prefixes, and lexical resources for use in linguistic processing or transliteration tasks.",
  "sources": "The code itself, which declares in-memory data structures (dictionaries, lists, sets) for sandhi variations, prefixes, and related linguistic data.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks such as network operations, file writing, or system commands that handle untrusted input or output.",
  "flows": "The code primarily loads static data structures; there are no dynamic data flows or processing pipelines involving untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are evident. Variable names and comments are consistent with linguistic data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static data definitions: dictionaries, lists, and a set related to Sanskrit phonological and morphological rules. There are no functions, no I/O operations, and no dynamic code execution. The data appears to serve linguistic processing purposes, such as sandhi rules and prefix handling. The 'samMap' and 'filtered_words' are simple mappings and lists, with no indication of malicious intent. The code includes an '__all__' export list, which is standard practice for module exports. No code constructs indicate malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a collection of static linguistic resources for Sanskrit language processing. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code. It is safe and intended for linguistic data management within a larger application.",
