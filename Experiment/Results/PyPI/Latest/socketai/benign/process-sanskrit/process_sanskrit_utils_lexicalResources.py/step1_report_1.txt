{
  "purpose": "This code defines linguistic resources related to Sanskrit sandhi rules, prefixes, and related lexical mappings for use in a Sanskrit text processing module.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data structures such as dictionaries and lists defining linguistic rules and mappings.",
  "sinks": "There are no code segments that process untrusted input or output data; the code primarily initializes static resources.",
  "flows": "The code only initializes static data; no dynamic data flow from sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code identified.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static data definitions: dictionaries and lists for sandhi rules, mappings, and prefixes. No functions or data processing routines are included that could execute external code or leak information. The data appears to be carefully curated linguistic data, with no signs of malicious intent or hidden code behaviors. The inclusion of variable definitions, mappings, and lists is typical for a language processing resource module. There are no obfuscated patterns or suspicious code constructs. Overall, the code appears safe and solely focused on linguistic data initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains static, well-structured linguistic data resources with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use in a Sanskrit text processing context.",
