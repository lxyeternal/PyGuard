{
  "purpose": "Defines linguistic resources and mappings related to Sanskrit sandhi, prefixes, and declinables for use in Sanskrit language processing.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading; static dictionaries and lists initialized within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; all data is statically defined and used internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present. The code appears to serve linguistic resource purposes only.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static dictionaries and lists for Sanskrit language processing, including sandhi variations, prefix mappings, declinables, and related resources. There are no functions, no external I/O, no network operations, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident. The data appears to be linguistic resources without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward collection of static linguistic data intended for Sanskrit language processing. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe and purely informational.",
