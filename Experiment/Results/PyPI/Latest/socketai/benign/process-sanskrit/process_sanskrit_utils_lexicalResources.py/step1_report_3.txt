{
  "purpose": "The code defines various dictionaries and lists related to Sanskrit phonetic and morphological transformations, particularly sandhi rules, prefixes, and lexical resources, for use in linguistic processing within the 'sandhi' module.",
  "sources": "The data structures are hardcoded within the module, such as dictionaries for sandhi variations, fixed maps, prefixes, and lexical weights; no external data input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input data; the code primarily contains static data definitions and mappings.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code does not include functions or logic that process external data streams or execute untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of static data definitions; no suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as dynamic execution, code injection, or obfuscated code, is present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static resources for Sanskrit linguistic transformations, with dictionaries and lists explicitly defined. No functions, input processing, or external data handling are present that could introduce malicious behavior. All data appears to be hardcoded, domain-specific, and intended for linguistic processing. No signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads are identified. The module appears to serve as a resource file with no executable or exploitable logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely static data with no indications of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It functions as a linguistic resource module for Sanskrit processing. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or security risks within this code segment.",
