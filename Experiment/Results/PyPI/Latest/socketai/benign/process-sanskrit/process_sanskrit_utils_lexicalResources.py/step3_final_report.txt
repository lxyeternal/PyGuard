{
  "purpose": "Static data definitions for Sanskrit sandhi rules, prefixes, and lexical mappings used in linguistic processing.",
  "sources": "Predefined dictionaries, lists, and sets initialized with linguistic data; no external data sources or input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; static data used internally without external output or data flow to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded into variables at module import; no runtime data flow or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typographical errors in comments (e.g., 'beṛore' instead of 'before') are linguistic, not security issues; no suspicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static, well-structured data structures related to Sanskrit linguistic rules and mappings. No functions, dynamic code, or external interactions are present. The data is domain-specific and curated, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the static, safe nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detectable within this module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static resource module containing linguistic data for Sanskrit processing. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
