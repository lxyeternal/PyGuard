  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the static nature of the code, the absence of dynamic or executable elements, and the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code solely consists of static data structures: dictionaries, lists, and sets.\n- No functions, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious code patterns.\n- The data is domain-specific, curated for Sanskrit linguistic processing, with no signs of backdoors or secrets.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is safe, with malware and security risk scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Critical Evaluation:\n\n**1. Are the reported issues present?**  \n- All reports agree that the code contains only static data, with no processing or external data handling.  \n- No issues such as code injection, data leaks, or obfuscation are evident.  \n- **Confirmed:** No issues are present.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n- The reports correctly identify the static, non-executable nature of the code.  \n- They also note the absence of malicious behavior, which aligns with the code content.  \n- No logical flaws are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n- All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, which is appropriate given the static data nature.  \n- The confidence scores are high (1.0), consistent with the thorough reasoning.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n- Since all reports assign zero to malware and security risk, and the code is static data, no justification for higher scores exists.  \n- **Scores seem reasonable.**\n\n**5. Malware score reflection:**  \n- No malicious code or behavior is present; malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions?**  \n- All assessments are based on static analysis, which is appropriate.  \n- No unwarranted assumptions are evident.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n- Scores are consistent with the static, safe nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- The data includes mappings, lists, and dictionaries for Sanskrit sandhi rules, prefixes, and lexical variations.  \n- The inclusion of the `__all__` list indicates standard module export practices.  \n- No signs of obfuscation, such as encoded strings or dynamic code generation, are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward, static data.  \n**Risk score:** **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is a static resource module for Sanskrit linguistic processing. It contains no executable code, no external data handling, and no signs of malicious intent. The data structures are well-formed and domain-specific.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **The reports are accurate and thorough.**  \n- **The scores are appropriate given the static, safe nature of the code.**  \n- **No changes or escalations are necessary.**\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nI concur with the existing assessments. The code is safe, static, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores reflect this accurately.",
