{
  "purpose": "This module provides dictionaries and lists related to Sanskrit phonetic and morphological sandhi rules, prefixes, and lexical resources for use in Sanskrit language processing.",
  "sources": "Data structures such as dictionaries and lists, primarily containing static lexical and phonetic data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted input; the code only defines static data, no input/output operations present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external untrusted sources to sinks; all data are hardcoded and static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and consists solely of static data definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple dictionaries, lists, and a variable __all__, all of which define static linguistic data related to Sanskrit phonetics and morphology. There are no functions, no external input/output operations, and no dynamic code execution. The dictionaries include mappings for sandhi rules, prefixes, declinables, and lexical variants. The data appears consistent with standard Sanskrit phonological rules and lexical resources. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The only potential concern could be if this data were used in a context where malicious data could be injected externally, but within this module, all data is static and hardcoded.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static data resource for Sanskrit linguistic processing and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe and purely informational.",
