{
  "purpose": "This module manages database setup, connection pooling, session handling, and resource resolution for a SQLite database used in Sanskrit processing, employing best practices for concurrency and performance.",
  "sources": "Path resolution via importlib.resources, database existence check, database connection establishment, PRAGMA commands, ORM model definitions, and configuration during engine creation.",
  "sinks": "Database connection and configuration, session creation, and ORM operations; no external untrusted data flows or network activity are present.",
  "flows": "Path resolution → database existence check → engine creation with PRAGMA setup → session management → ORM interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of 'check_same_thread=False' is standard but warrants awareness of concurrency implications.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard, well-structured practices for SQLite database management in Python, including resource resolution, connection pooling, thread-safe sessions, and PRAGMA tuning for concurrency. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The connection setup and session utilities are typical for multi-threaded applications, and error handling is appropriate. The use of 'check_same_thread=False' is a known pattern for multi-threaded SQLite access, not inherently malicious. The resource fallback paths and importlib usage are safe and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and well-implemented database management module with no malicious intent or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
