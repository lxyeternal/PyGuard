  "purpose": "Database setup and connection management for Sanskrit processing, including lazy loading, connection pooling, session management, and database initialization.",
  "sources": "Import statements, get_db_path() function, get_engine(), get_session_factory(), get_scoped_session(), get_session(), session_scope(), with_session(), requires_database(), and the Base model definition.",
  "sinks": "Database connection creation, execution of PRAGMA statements, creation of tables, and session commits/rollbacks.",
  "flows": "Path from get_engine() calling get_db_path() and database_exists() -> engine connection -> PRAGMA settings -> session operations -> table creation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no suspicious file path manipulations beyond fallback resolution, no obfuscated code, and no network communication or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard database setup and connection management using SQLAlchemy with lazy loading, connection pooling, and session handling. It includes safeguards for missing database files, attempts to optimize SQLite performance via PRAGMA statements, and uses importlib.resources with fallback mechanisms to locate the database file. All functions are typical for database initialization in Python web or processing applications. There is no suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms detected. The code is well-structured, uses best practices for resource management, and does not exhibit obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate database management module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It properly handles resource initialization, error handling, and concurrency considerations. No malware, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
