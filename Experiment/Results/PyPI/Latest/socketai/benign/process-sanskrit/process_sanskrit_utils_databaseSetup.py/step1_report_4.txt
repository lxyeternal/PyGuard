  "purpose": "Database setup and connection management for Sanskrit processing, providing optimized access patterns, session handling, and database initialization.",
  "sources": "importlib.resources for database path resolution, environment for configuration, database file existence check, SQLAlchemy engine and session creation, PRAGMA settings in connection event.",
  "sinks": "Database connection establishment, PRAGMA execution, session commit/rollback, database file access.",
  "flows": "Path resolution to database file -> database existence check -> engine creation -> connection event PRAGMA setup -> session creation and usage -> transaction handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.resources with fallback path; setting PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL; connection pooling parameters; no explicit hardcoded credentials; no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages database connections with lazy loading, connection pooling, and thread-safe sessions using SQLAlchemy. It includes prudent PRAGMA settings for concurrency, robust error handling, and fallback mechanisms for database path resolution. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are evident. The only notable feature is the configuration of SQLite PRAGMA settings for performance, which is standard for optimized database access. No suspicious or malicious activity detected, and no external network communication or data exfiltration present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard database connection management module with proper security practices, optimized for performance, and no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears safe and appropriate for production use in the context described.",
