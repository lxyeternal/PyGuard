{
  "purpose": "This module manages database setup, connection, and ORM operations for Sanskrit processing, ensuring optimized access and thread safety.",
  "sources": "importlib.resources for database path resolution; os.path for fallback path; get_engine() for database connection; environment variables indirectly via SQLAlchemy connect_args.",
  "sinks": "Database connection establishment; PRAGMA commands that modify database behavior; session management functions that execute queries; exception handling for database file existence.",
  "flows": "Path resolution (sources) -> get_engine() creates engine -> connection event sets PRAGMA -> session operations perform database queries",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Use of PRAGMA statements for performance tuning is normal but could be misused if malicious. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed. The fallback path handling is cautious, but no unusual or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard database setup and connection management for an application requiring efficient, thread-safe access to a SQLite database. It uses modern Python practices like importlib.resources for resource management, SQLAlchemy for ORM and connection pooling, and context managers for session handling. PRAGMA statements are used for optimizing SQLite concurrency, which is appropriate. No hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or backdoors are detected. Error handling is clear, and logging is thorough. All functions perform expected tasks within the scope of database setup and access. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a well-structured, standard database management module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It manages database connections efficiently and securely, following best practices. No malware indicators are present.",
