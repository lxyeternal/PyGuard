{
  "purpose": "This module manages database setup, connection handling, and session management for Sanskrit processing, focusing on efficient access and concurrency.",
  "sources": "Import statements for os, importlib.resources, logging, threading, functools, contextlib, typing, and SQLAlchemy modules; functions that read database file paths and check for database existence.",
  "sinks": "Database connection creation and configuration, execution of PRAGMA statements on database connect, creation and querying of database tables.",
  "flows": "Path resolution functions supply database file paths to get_engine; get_engine creates database engine and sets PRAGMA; session_scope manages transaction boundaries; initialize_database creates tables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; standard database and session management code; no hidden code or obfuscated constructs. Use of PRAGMA commands is typical for performance tuning, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard database initialization, connection pooling, and session management for SQLite. It uses importlib.resources for resource path resolution, with fallback mechanisms. Connection pooling and PRAGMA configurations are correctly applied for concurrency and performance. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code employs best practices for resource management and thread safety. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected beyond routine database handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured database management module for a Sanskrit processing application. It uses appropriate techniques for resource resolution, connection pooling, and session handling without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
