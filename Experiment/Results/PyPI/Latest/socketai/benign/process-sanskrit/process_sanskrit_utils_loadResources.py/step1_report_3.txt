{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load resource files and a TSV mapping into Python data structures, likely for further processing or analysis within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads from resource files 'MWKeysOnly.json' and 'type_map.tsv' using get_resource_path(), which determines the file paths for resource files within a package or fallback directory.",
  "sinks": "Data read from the resource files is loaded into Python objects; no external sinks or outputs are directly used or exposed within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Resource files are accessed via get_resource_path(), then opened and read into Python variables; no external data flow beyond local file I/O occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The use of importlib.resources.files().joinpath() in a try block for Python 3.9+ with a fallback for older versions is standard; no anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs resource path resolution using importlib.resources for Python 3.9+ and a fallback method for earlier versions, then loads JSON data and TSV data into memory. It uses safe file operations and standard Python libraries. No untrusted input or external network interactions are present. The code appears to be straightforward resource loading without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing resource file access and data loading tasks with standard practices. There are no signs of malicious activity, malicious payloads, or security risks within this fragment.",
