{
  "purpose": "Load resource files ('MWKeysOnly.json' and 'type_map.tsv') into Python data structures for further processing.",
  "sources": "Reading local resource files via importlib.resources or filesystem fallback",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or data exfiltration present",
  "flows": "Resource files are accessed and loaded into variables without external data flow or processing of untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for resource loading",
  "analysis": "The code uses importlib.resources with a fallback to access resource files safely across Python versions. It loads a JSON file into a dictionary and a TSV file into another dictionary, with no user input, network activity, or external data handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The resource handling is standard, and the code appears benign and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard resource loader with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The resource access is safe, and the code does not process untrusted input or perform external communications. The overall security risk is negligible.",
