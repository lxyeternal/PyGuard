{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load resource files (JSON and TSV) using importlib.resources and fallback methods, then process the JSON data into a dictionary and load a TSV file into a type map.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from resource files ('MWKeysOnly.json' and 'type_map.tsv') via get_resource_path() and directly from the filesystem for the TSV file.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted input; the code only reads local resource files and processes them internally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from resource files into Python data structures (json.load and dictionary population), with no user input or external network interaction involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The use of importlib.resources is standard for resource handling.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes importlib.resources to access resource files, with a fallback to filesystem paths for compatibility with older Python versions. It loads a JSON file into a dictionary and reads a TSV file into another dictionary, both in a safe manner. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The resource handling and file parsing are standard and secure. No secrets or credentials are hardcoded, and no suspicious code execution is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign resource loader for a larger project. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. It is safe and standard in its approach.",
