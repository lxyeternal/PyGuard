{
  "purpose": "The code loads resource files and a TSV file to create dictionaries for further processing, likely related to Sanskrit text or linguistic data handling.",
  "sources": "importlib.resources for resource path retrieval, open() functions for reading JSON and TSV files",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted input handling, no data output to external sources, no network operations",
  "flows": "Resource paths are obtained and files are read, with data loaded into dictionaries; no flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except for fallback path resolution is standard; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads static resource files: a JSON file and a TSV file. It employs importlib.resources for compatibility across Python versions, and reads the files into dictionaries. There are no external inputs, user data, or network operations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The structure and operations are straightforward and typical for resource management in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard resource-loading module with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply reads and loads data files into dictionaries for further processing, with no suspicious or harmful behavior detected.",
