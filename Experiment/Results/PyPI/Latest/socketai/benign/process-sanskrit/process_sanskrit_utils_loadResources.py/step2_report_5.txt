  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the security implications, scoring, and consistency.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a resource loader that uses importlib.resources with fallback to filesystem paths.\n- The code reads local resource files ('MWKeysOnly.json' and 'type_map.tsv') into Python data structures.\n- No external network activity, user input handling, or untrusted data processing is involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The scores assigned are consistently low, with malware scores at 0 and security risks near zero.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code as provided **does not** contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- It performs standard resource loading operations safely.\n- No external or untrusted input is processed, and no data is sent externally.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The code appears well-structured and safe.\n- The fallback method for older Python versions is standard practice.\n- No logical flaws or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is justified.\n- **Security risk:** Given the benign nature, scores of 0 or 0.1 are appropriate, as the only minor concern could be the fallback path handling, which is standard.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- Some reports assign a securityRisk of 0.1, citing the fallback method, but this is a common practice and not risky.\n- No report assigns a higher risk score, which is correct.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their security evaluation.\n- The code is safe, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0 (or 0.1 if considering fallback handling as a minor concern)\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's actual behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe resource loader with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with minimal security risk.",
