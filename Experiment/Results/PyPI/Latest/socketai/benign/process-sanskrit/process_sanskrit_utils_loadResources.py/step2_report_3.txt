  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Uses `importlib.resources` (with fallback) to access resource files (`MWKeysOnly.json` and `type_map.tsv`)\n- Loads JSON data into a dictionary\n- Loads TSV data into a dictionary\n- No user input, network activity, or external data flows\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code\n- Standard resource handling and file parsing practices\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code appears to function as intended, securely reading local resource files.\n- No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is evident.\n- No vulnerabilities or security risks are apparent from the code snippet.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical or security flaws are apparent.\n- The fallback method for older Python versions is standard and safe.\n- The resource access pattern is appropriate.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign `0`. No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign very low (0 or 0.1). Given the code's benign nature, these seem reasonable.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- The code does **not** process untrusted input, nor does it perform any network operations.\n- The resource handling is standard and safe.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly states the code is safe.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 or 0 — minimal risk, primarily because it reads local files only.\n\n### Consistency:\n- Scores are consistent across reports, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\nBased on the detailed reviews, I agree with the provided scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or 0) — very low, given no external inputs or network activity.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a standard resource loader, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The fallback handling for older Python versions is appropriate and safe.\n- The resource files are assumed to be part of the package, not external or untrusted sources.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, standard, and free of security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified. No further changes are necessary.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or 0.1 for conservative low risk)\n\nThese reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
