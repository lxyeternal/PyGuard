  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code's purpose is to load resource files (JSON and TSV) into memory, with no external inputs, network activity, or data outputs.\n- The resource handling via importlib.resources with a fallback is standard practice.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, network activity, or data exfiltration, is evident.\n- The code is straightforward, primarily for resource management and data loading.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Discrepancies:\n\n- **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n  All reports confirm that the code is benign and performs standard resource loading. There are no indications of issues or vulnerabilities in the code itself.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**  \n  No errors or flaws are identified across reports. The fallback method for older Python versions is appropriate and correctly implemented.\n\n- **Scores assigned to issues:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.1). These are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Scores:\n\n- **Malware score (0):**  \n  Consistent with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score (0):**  \n  Correct, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk score (0 or 0.1):**  \n  Given the code's benign nature, a score of 0 is justified. A slight increase to 0.1 in some reports accounts for minimal risk due to resource handling, but overall, these are acceptable.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports assign risk scores above 0.5.  \n- The highest risk score is 0.1, which is reasonable considering the code only reads local files and does not process untrusted input or perform network operations.\n\n### Consistency & Reasonableness:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no overestimation or underestimation is apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment & Recommendations:\n\n**Overall malware score:** **0**  \n**Overall obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Overall risk score:** **0 to 0.1** (most likely 0)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard resource loader with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The resource handling is safe, and the code is not obfuscated or vulnerable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **Issues present?** No.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** No.  \n- **Scores reasonable?** Yes.  \n- **Any claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?** No, the analysis correctly identifies the code as benign.  \n- **Are the scores consistent?** Yes.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe current scores are appropriate. I would assign a **malware score of 0**, an **obfuscated score of 0**, and a **risk score of 0**. The code is safe, standard, and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always monitor for future updates or changes, but based on this static analysis, the code is secure.",
