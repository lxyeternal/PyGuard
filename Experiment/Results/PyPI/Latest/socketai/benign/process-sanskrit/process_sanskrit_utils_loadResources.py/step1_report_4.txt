{
  "purpose": "The code loads resource files and a TSV type map for processing Sanskrit data.",
  "sources": "Input sources include resource files 'MWKeysOnly.json' and 'type_map.tsv' accessed via importlib.resources and file system.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted input or produce external output.",
  "flows": "Resource paths are determined, and data from JSON and TSV files are loaded into memory without further data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.resources with a fallback method is standard; no suspicious or unusual code behavior identified. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles resource management and file reading: it retrieves resource paths dynamically, loads a JSON file containing keys, and reads a TSV file into a dictionary. The code correctly handles Python version differences and uses safe file access methods. No malicious code or malicious behavior patterns are evident. The logic is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or untrusted data processing beyond reading local files.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate resource-loading script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on local files, and there are no anomalies or suspicious behaviors.",
