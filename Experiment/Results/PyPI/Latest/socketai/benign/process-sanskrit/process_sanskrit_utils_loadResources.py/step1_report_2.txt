{
  "purpose": "The code loads resource files and a TSV file into memory for further processing, likely related to Sanskrit dictionary data.",
  "sources": "Reading 'MWKeysOnly.json' from package resources; reading a TSV file specified by a file path argument.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; file reads are from local resources or given file path, not from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from resource files into in-memory dictionaries; no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.resources with fallback for older Python versions is normal; no suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script uses importlib.resources to access package data, which is a standard approach, with a fallback for older Python versions. It loads a JSON file containing dictionary keys and a TSV file into a dictionary. The code reads files from local resources or specified paths, with no external data sources or network activity. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The functions appear straightforward, and no insecure practices are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard resource-loading script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It safely reads local resource files and processes data without any suspicious behavior.",
