{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Flask web service for Sanskrit text processing, transliteration, dictionary lookup, and translation via OpenAI's API, exposing multiple endpoints for these functions.",
  "sources": "Request data from POST bodies (request.data, request.get_json()), environment variables for API keys, and external functions like process_sanskrit.process and get_voc_entry.",
  "sinks": "Response JSON outputs, response files written to disk with timestamped filenames, and API calls to OpenAI's chat.completions.create.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from request bodies to processing functions, then to API calls or file outputs; responses from API are returned or saved; environment variables supply API keys.",
  "anomalies": "The model name 'gpt-4-O' is non-standard and suspicious; environment variable 'DATABASE_API_KEY' is misnamed if used for OpenAI API; responses are saved to timestamped files without sanitization; debug mode is enabled.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard NLP API functions with minimal input validation and insecure file handling. The API key retrieval is standard but the variable name is misleading. The model name 'gpt-4-O' is likely a typo or malicious. No obfuscated or malicious code segments are present. Response handling lacks sanitization, and debug mode is enabled, which is unsafe in production. Overall, no malicious intent is evident, but configuration issues and potential misuse of the model name pose moderate security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The primary concerns are misconfiguration of the API model name, insecure response file handling, and environment variable naming. These should be verified and corrected to ensure secure operation.",
