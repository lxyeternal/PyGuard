  "purpose": "This file ensures the resources directory is treated as a Python package and allows resource files to be included in the package distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or data; it is a comment serving as documentation.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code is purely a comment with no executable statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a comment with no executable code, data handling, or suspicious features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comment intended to document the purpose of the resources directory in a Python package. All reports correctly identify that there are no executable statements, data flows, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious features are present. The code poses no security threat, and the scores are consistent with the content. The code serves purely as documentation and does not introduce any security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a documentation comment to indicate resource directory handling in a Python package. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are justified and accurate.",
