  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package by indicating that the resources directory is a package, enabling resource files to be included in the distribution.",
  "sources": "The comments and possibly the presence of a __init__.py file (implied by the purpose) that signals package initialization.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or points where untrusted data could be processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or input/output operations in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely a comment describing package setup; no executable code, input handling, or resource access present.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet contains only comments explaining the purpose of a file that likely contains minimal or no executable code. It is a standard package resource setup comment without any suspicious or malicious content. No source-to-sink data flows, no hardcoded secrets, no code execution, or external communication are present. As such, it poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package resource declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
