{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions from a module related to processing Sanskrit language data, including processing, dictionary lookup, and transliteration utilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load functions: 'process', 'get_voc_entry', and 'transliterate' from external modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are shown in the provided snippet; the code only imports functions.",
  "flows": "No execution flow or data processing is demonstrated; the code snippet only includes import statements without actual data handling or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are evident. The imports are straightforward and from presumably legitimate modules.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements bringing in three functions from a module named 'process_sanskrit'. There is no execution, data handling, or potential security-sensitive operations visible. These functions appear to be related to Sanskrit language processing, such as processing text, dictionary lookup, and transliteration. Since only imports are shown, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or external network interactions are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks. The code simply imports functions likely used elsewhere in the application. No malware, suspicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are detectable from these lines alone.",
