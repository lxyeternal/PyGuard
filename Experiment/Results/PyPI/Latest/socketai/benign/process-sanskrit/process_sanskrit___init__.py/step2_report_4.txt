  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports focus solely on import statements of functions related to Sanskrit processing.\n- No execution, data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears standard, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** No issues; straightforward imports; high confidence (0.9); no malware; very low security risk (0.1).\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The logic is sound; no anomalies or malicious activity. The risk score is appropriately low, given the benign nature.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Same as above; confident (1.0); no malware; no security risk.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The analysis is consistent; no issues detected.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Similar, with slightly lower confidence (0.8); no malware; low risk.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The reasoning aligns with the code snippet.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Same as above; high confidence (1.0); no malware; minimal risk.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Same; confidence 0.8; no malware; no security risk.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### General Comments:\n- **Malware Score:** All are zero, which is appropriate given the benign import statements.\n- **Obfuscated:** Zero across all reports; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Potential improvements:\n- Since all reports are consistent and accurate, I agree with their scores.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, around 0.1, which is appropriate given the limited scope.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code snippet. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security issues in these import statements.",
