{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import functions related to processing Sanskrit text, including processing text, dictionary lookup, and transliteration utilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'process_sanskrit.functions.process', 'process_sanskrit.functions.dictionaryLookup', and 'process_sanskrit.utils.transliterationUtils'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data handling is visible in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is demonstrated in this minimal code snippet; it only shows imports without execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present in these import statements. The code is straightforward and uses standard import syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three functions/modules related to Sanskrit processing: 'process', 'get_voc_entry', and 'transliterate'. These imports suggest the script may perform text processing or translation tasks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or suspicious network activity, in the import statements alone. Without additional context or code execution, the snippet does not demonstrate malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided import statements, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be part of a Sanskrit processing tool, and the import statements are typical for such applications.",
