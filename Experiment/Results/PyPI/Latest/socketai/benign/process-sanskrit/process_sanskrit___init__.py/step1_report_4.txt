{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import functions related to processing Sanskrit text, including processing functions, dictionary lookups, and transliteration utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from 'process_sanskrit.functions.process', 'process_sanskrit.functions.dictionaryLookup', and 'process_sanskrit.utils.transliterationUtils'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs are evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable in this fragment; it only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains import statements without any actual execution or data handling; no suspicious or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three modules likely related to Sanskrit text processing tasks. There are no input reads, no data processing, no network activity, nor any code execution beyond imports. Since it’s limited to import statements, there are no apparent security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import set for Sanskrit processing functions and utilities, with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It appears to be standard and benign.",
