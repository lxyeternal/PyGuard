{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions related to processing Sanskrit language data, including processing text, dictionary lookup, and transliteration utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from the 'process_sanskrit' package modules: 'process', 'dictionaryLookup', and 'transliterationUtils'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data output, network communication, or file writing are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable in this code fragment as it only includes import statements without execution or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The code consists solely of import statements from a presumably legitimate package.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three functions from a 'process_sanskrit' package. These functions are likely used for processing Sanskrit text, looking up vocabulary entries, and performing transliteration. No data processing, input reading, or malicious behavior is present. The imports alone do not indicate any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on these import statements, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. The code appears to be standard language processing utility imports. No suspicious activity or security concerns are identifiable from this fragment.",
