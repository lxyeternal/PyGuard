{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions related to Sanskrit language processing, including processing, dictionary lookup, and transliteration.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'process_sanskrit.functions.process', 'process_sanskrit.functions.dictionaryLookup', and 'process_sanskrit.utils.transliterationUtils'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only imports modules.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution occurs in this snippet; only import statements are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for functions related to Sanskrit language processing. There is no code execution, data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The imported modules appear legitimate and domain-specific. The absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets indicates a benign snippet. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is negligible. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate given the limited context. Without further code or context, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of import statements for language processing functions. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
