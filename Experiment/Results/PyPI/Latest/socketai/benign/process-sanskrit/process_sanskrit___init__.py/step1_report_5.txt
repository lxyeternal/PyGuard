{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import functions related to processing Sanskrit language data, including processing, dictionary lookup, and transliteration utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'process_sanskrit.functions.process', 'process_sanskrit.functions.dictionaryLookup', and 'process_sanskrit.utils.transliterationUtils'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code only contains import statements and no data processing or flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains import statements without any actual execution or data handling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are evident. The imported modules could be used maliciously if they contain harmful code, but based solely on this snippet, no malicious activity is apparent.",
  "analysis": "This code snippet only imports functions from a presumably external or internal module related to Sanskrit language processing. There are no input sources, data flows, or sink points visible. Without further context or actual function calls, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The imports are standard for language processing tasks. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are visible in these import statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of import statements for Sanskrit processing functions, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based on this snippet alone. There is no active code or data handling that could pose a security threat.",
