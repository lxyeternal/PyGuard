  "purpose": "Import utility functions related to transliteration, detection, and resource loading from a Sanskrit processing package.",
  "sources": "Import statements accessing functions within the process_sanskrit.utils module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are evident; the code only imports functions",
  "flows": "No data flows are initiated in this snippet as it only imports functions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected in the import statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements to bring specific utility functions into the module namespace. These functions are likely used elsewhere in the application. There is no data processing, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. The imports appear standard for a utility-based package, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple import statement segment with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any operations, data handling, or external communications. Therefore, it poses no security risk.",
