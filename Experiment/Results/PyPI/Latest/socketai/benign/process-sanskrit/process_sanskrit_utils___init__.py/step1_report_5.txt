{
  "purpose": "Import utility functions related to transliteration, detection, and resource loading from the process_sanskrit package.",
  "sources": "Import statements retrieving functions from specific modules within process_sanskrit.utils.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potentially vulnerable points; the code only imports functions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or execution flow is evident in import statements alone.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard import statements with no embedded code execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three functions from a package, which appears to be related to Sanskrit text processing. All imports are static and do not execute any code beyond referencing modules. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. As the code only performs imports, it does not pose any immediate security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of safe import statements for utility functions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks based on this fragment.",
