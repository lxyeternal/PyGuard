  "purpose": "Import main utility functions related to transliteration, detection, and resource loading for processing Sanskrit text.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing functions from external modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or output operations are present in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is only importing functions without executing any potentially malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal utility modules, which is common in modular Python projects. There are no indications of data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior. No external network connections, data manipulations, or sensitive operations are evident. The code appears to be a standard setup for a module that will use these utilities later.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet contains only harmless import statements with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is standard code for a Python package's initialization or module setup.",
