  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling is visible in the given code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are present; the code is purely import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements that load functions from a package related to Sanskrit text processing. There are no input/output operations, no data handling, and no dynamic execution or obfuscated code. As such, there is no indication of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code appears to be a standard setup for a module that will utilize these imported functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing straightforward imports of utility functions. There are no signs of malicious intent or security concerns based on this snippet.",
