{
  "purpose": "The code imports utility functions from the process_sanskrit.utils package for transliteration, detection, and resource loading.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal utility modules; no data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static imports do not involve runtime data movement or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward import statements from internal modules. No dynamic code execution, data handling, or network activity is present. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of such static imports, with high confidence. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk scores are appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
