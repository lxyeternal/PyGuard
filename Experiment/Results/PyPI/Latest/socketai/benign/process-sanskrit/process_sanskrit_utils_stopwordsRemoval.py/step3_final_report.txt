  "purpose": "Load stopwords from an external CSV resource and remove them from input text or list.",
  "sources": "get_resource_path('stopwords.csv') for file path; open() for reading file content.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only local file I/O and string/list processing.",
  "flows": "Read stopwords from file -> store in list -> remove from input text or list.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code safely loads stopwords with error handling, processes text by removing stopwords, and does not perform any network activity, code injection, or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or malicious operations are present. The logic is simple and clear, with appropriate error handling. External resource reliance is typical but does not introduce malicious risk. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for stopword removal with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
