{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load a list of stopwords from an external resource file and remove these stopwords from input text, either as a string or a list of words.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from a resource file 'stopwords.csv' via get_resource_path and also accepts external input through the function parameter 'text_or_list'.",
  "sinks": "The input data is processed in the functions 'remove_stopwords_string' and 'remove_stopwords_list', but no untrusted data is written to external systems or used insecurely beyond local processing.",
  "flows": "The flow begins with loading the stopwords from the resource file, then passing input data to removal functions, which filter out stopwords based on the loaded list.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard file I/O and text processing without unusual or suspicious operations. There is no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or handling of untrusted external commands.",
  "analysis": "The code loads stopwords from a resource file using a helper function. It handles file errors gracefully, printing warnings. The stopwords are stored in a list for quick lookup. The removal functions operate on strings and lists, filtering out stopwords efficiently. The code does not contain any code injection, data leakage, or insecure practices. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns are present. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of stopword removal with safe handling of file I/O and data processing. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It functions as intended without hidden or malicious code.",
