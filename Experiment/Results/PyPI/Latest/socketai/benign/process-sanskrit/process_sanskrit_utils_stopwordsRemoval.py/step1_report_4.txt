{
  "purpose": "Load stopwords from a CSV file and remove them from text input, either as a string or list of words.",
  "sources": "The code reads the stopwords CSV file located via get_resource_path and reads input text through function parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code processes text inputs to remove stopwords; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Reads stopwords file -> Stores in stopwords_as_list -> Accepts text input -> Removes stopwords from string/list -> Returns cleaned text.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network activity; no obfuscation; no unusual dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code safely loads stopwords from a resource path and handles file exceptions appropriately. The stopword removal functions are straightforward and do not execute external code or access sensitive data beyond the stopwords file. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or privacy violations are detected. The code is simple, with clear input/output, and does not include suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for processing text and does not contain malicious behavior. It securely loads data, processes input safely, and handles errors gracefully. No security threats or malware indications are present.",
