{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load stopwords from a CSV file and provide functions to remove stopwords from either a string or a list of words.",
  "sources": "get_resource_path function (imported from process_sanskrit.utils.loadResources), file open operation to read stopwords, input parameter 'text_or_list' in remove_stopwords function",
  "sinks": "File reading operations (reading stopwords), string split and replace operations, list comprehension filtering stopwords",
  "flows": "Reading stopwords from file -> storing in stopwords_as_list -> remove_stopwords functions process input string/list and filter out stopwords",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. The code reads a resource file and processes text normally. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated parts are present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads stopwords from an external CSV file located via get_resource_path, handling potential file-not-found or reading errors gracefully with warnings. It provides functions to remove stopwords from text, either from strings or lists, by filtering out known stopwords. No untrusted data handling beyond reading a file is present. The flow appears straightforward and safe. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The only point of concern might be reliance on the external resource, but that does not constitute malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for stopword removal with safe file handling and no indications of malicious or maliciously sabotaged code. It performs legitimate text processing functions without security risks.",
