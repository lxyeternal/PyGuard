{
  "purpose": "The code loads a list of stopwords from a CSV resource file and provides functions to remove these stopwords from strings or lists of words.",
  "sources": "The get_resource_path function to locate 'stopwords.csv'; file reading operation to load stopwords; input parameter 'text_or_list' in remove_stopwords.",
  "sinks": "Reading from the stopwords file; string operations within remove_stopwords_string (e.g., replace, split, join).",
  "flows": "get_resource_path -> open/read stopwords.csv -> load stopwords list -> remove_stopwords functions process input data.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard Python file handling; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious network calls or obfuscated code; error handling is minimal but benign; no malicious intent apparent.",
  "analysis": "The script appears to be a straightforward utility for stopword removal, with safe file access and processing. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious code are present. The only minor concern is the lack of validation on the resource path or input types, which is not suspicious but a standard consideration. The stopword file is loaded from a resource path, and no sensitive data or commands are executed. The functions perform text processing securely without executing untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in this code. It is a benign utility module for stopword removal with safe operations and no malicious signals.",
