  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code loads stopwords from an external resource via `get_resource_path('stopwords.csv')`.\n- It reads the stopwords into a list, with error handling for file not found or read errors.\n- The removal functions operate on strings or lists, filtering out stopwords.\n- No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, code injection, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are observed.\n- The code appears straightforward, safe, and intended for text processing.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Clear, matches code.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, safe error handling.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Security Risk: 0 (correct)  \n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity, proper error handling.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Security Risk: 0 (correct)  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Similar, detailed.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, no external communication, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Security Risk: 0.1 — Slightly above zero, but the report states no suspicious activity. The small security risk might be justified as a cautious acknowledgment of reliance on external resource, but it's minimal.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly elevated security risk score (0.1) is acceptable given the external resource dependency, but overall, the code remains benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as others, straightforward.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Security Risk: 0 (correct)  \n\n**Verdict:** Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Security Risk: 0 (correct)  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report (Report 3) assigning 0.1, which is reasonable considering the external resource dependency.\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign utility for stopword removal with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.** The slight security risk score in one report is justified by external resource reliance but does not indicate malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (acceptable due to resource dependency, but not malicious)\n\n**The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.**",
