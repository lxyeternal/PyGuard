  "purpose": "The code is designed to load stopwords from a CSV file and remove them from given text input, either as a string or list.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a CSV file located via get_resource_path('stopwords.csv').",
  "sinks": "The code processes input text by removing stopwords; it does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "The source (stopwords file) is read and stored in a list; the functions remove stopwords from user-provided input, either string or list.",
  "anomalies": "The code reads a resource file; no user input is directly involved. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are present. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script loads stopwords from an external CSV resource, handling potential file errors gracefully. It provides functions to remove stopwords from strings or lists. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is straightforward, performing data processing without side effects or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for stopword removal with proper error handling. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
