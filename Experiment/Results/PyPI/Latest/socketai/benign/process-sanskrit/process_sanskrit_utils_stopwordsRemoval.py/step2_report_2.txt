  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security issues, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code loads stopwords from an external resource file using `get_resource_path('stopwords.csv')`.\n- It reads and processes the stopwords file with standard file I/O, handling errors gracefully.\n- The removal functions process input text (string or list) by filtering out stopwords.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities is apparent.\n- The code is straightforward, performing text processing without side effects beyond local data handling.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate; describes standard stopword removal.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** The code is benign, safe, and performs expected functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correctly scored; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Similar to Report 1; accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Correctly scored; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Consistent with previous assessments.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No suspicious activity or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 (slightly above zero), obfuscated=0.\n  \n  *Note:* The securityRisk score is slightly above zero, but the reasoning indicates no actual security concern. Given the code's simplicity, this seems an overestimation. A score of 0.1 suggests minor concern, but since there's no actual risk, a score of 0 might be more appropriate.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — acceptable.\n\n**Recommendation:** Reduce `securityRisk` to 0, as no real risk exists.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Clear and accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Consistent.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment and recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero — consistent; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero — no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly zero, except Report 3's 0.1, which seems slightly overestimated given the code's benign nature.\n\n**Final suggestions:**\n\n- For **Report 3**, set `securityRisk` to **0** to better reflect the actual risk level.\n- The overall malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate at zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my estimates:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0      (was 0.1, now adjusted) |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe utility for stopword removal with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores are mostly appropriate, with a minor adjustment for Report 3's security risk score.",
