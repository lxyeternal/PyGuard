  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward transliteration utility leveraging the `indic_transliteration` library.\n- It optionally auto-detects the input script via an external `detect` function.\n- Uses `getattr` to dynamically select schemes from `sanscript`.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data exfiltration.\n- External `detect` function is a dependency; its behavior is unknown but assumed benign here.\n- No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Purpose: Transliteration utility with auto-detection.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0.1\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The report correctly states the code performs standard transliteration.\n- No malicious behavior or anomalies are evident.\n- The detection function is external, but no malicious intent is implied.\n- **Score justifications:** Malware is 0, consistent; risk is minimal, reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Purpose: Transliteration with optional auto-detection.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the external `detect`.\n- No malicious activity is apparent.\n- The risk score is slightly higher but still low; reasonable given external dependency.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Purpose: Transliteration with detection.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0.1\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Same conclusions; no malicious activity.\n- External detection is acknowledged but not problematic.\n- Scores seem justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Purpose: Transliteration with detection.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0.1\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Same as above; no issues detected.\n- External dependency is noted but not considered malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Purpose: Transliteration utility.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Consistent with previous reports.\n- No malicious signs.\n- Slightly higher risk score possibly due to reliance on external `detect`.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of all reports:**\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code performs expected transliteration tasks.\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign malware score as 0; no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Low, justified by external dependency on `detect`, but no inherent security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 is appropriate given reliance on external detection, but overall minimal risk.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n\n- If the `detect` function is malicious or compromised, that could introduce risk, but based on this code alone, no such behavior is evident.\n- The code itself is safe, standard, and well-structured.\n\n---\n\n## **Final conclusion:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**  | **0**        | **0.1–0.2** |\n\n**I recommend setting:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.15 (a balanced middle ground considering external dependency)\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis above.",
