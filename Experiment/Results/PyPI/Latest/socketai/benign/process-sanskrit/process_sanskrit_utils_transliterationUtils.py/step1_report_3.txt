{
  "purpose": "The code provides a function to transliterate text between different scripts and schemes, optionally auto-detecting the input scheme.",
  "sources": "The code reads input text via the 'text' parameter and the 'detect' function for scheme detection.",
  "sinks": "The transliterate function processes data internally; there are no sinks that send data externally or untrusted data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input text is optionally auto-detected for its scheme, then transliterated from the source to the target scheme.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The 'detect' function's implementation is external, but assumed safe.",
  "analysis": "The code performs transliteration using the 'indic_transliteration' library. It optionally auto-detects the input scheme via the 'detect' function. Scheme determination is based on external detection, and all operations are within expected library calls. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network interactions are present. The code does not handle sensitive credentials or perform unsafe operations. Its behavior appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for script transliteration with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It relies on external detection but does not process or transmit data insecurely.",
