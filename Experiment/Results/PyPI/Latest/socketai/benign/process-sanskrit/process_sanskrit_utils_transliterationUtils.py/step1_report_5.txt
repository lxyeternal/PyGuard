{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for transliterating text between different schemes, primarily for linguistic processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input text from function parameters and calls an external detection function `detect` to identify the input scheme.",
  "sinks": "The code calls `indic_transliterate`, which processes and transliterates text, and uses `getattr` to access attributes of the `sanscript` module based on detected or provided schemes.",
  "flows": "Input text is received through function arguments, scheme detection is performed via `detect(text)`, then the appropriate `sanscript` scheme attributes are accessed via `getattr`, and finally `indic_transliterate` processes the text using these schemes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are observed. The use of `getattr` is standard for dynamic attribute access, and all external functions are clearly imported.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and primarily handles transliteration operations. It uses the `detect` function to determine the input scheme dynamically, which could be a potential concern if `detect` were malicious, but it is imported from an external module and presumably safe. The dynamic attribute access via `getattr` is standard and based on user-provided input or detection results. The overall flow is typical for such a transliteration utility. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code relies on external modules for core functionality, which appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard linguistic processing utility with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs transliteration based on detected or provided schemes, and all operations seem legitimate and safe within the context of a transliteration library.",
