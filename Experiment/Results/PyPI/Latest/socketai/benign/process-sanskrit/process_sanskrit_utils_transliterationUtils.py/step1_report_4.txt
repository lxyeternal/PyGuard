{
  "purpose": "To transliterate text between different Indic scripts and schemes, with optional auto-detection of input scheme.",
  "sources": "The function reads input text (`text`) and optional input scheme (`input_scheme`). It also calls the `detect` function to identify the scheme when not provided.",
  "sinks": "The function outputs transliterated text, with no apparent data leakage or external effect. It calls `detect` for scheme detection, which could be an external dependency.",
  "flows": "Input text (and possibly scheme) -> detect() (for auto-detection) -> gets input_scheme and output_scheme -> indic_transliterate() -> output transliterated text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Usage of `getattr` on `sanscript` is standard for dynamic attribute access. The `detect` function's implementation is not provided, which could be a concern if malicious but cannot be determined here.",
  "analysis": "The code performs transliteration using a well-known library, with dynamic scheme selection via `getattr`. It uses an external detection function to auto-identify input schemes, which is a typical design for flexible transliteration. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior detected. The only external dependency is the `detect` function, but without its implementation, potential malicious behavior cannot be confirmed. The code does not perform network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. Overall, the code appears legitimate and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a transliteration function leveraging the `indic_transliteration` library, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. The only point of concern is the reliance on an external `detect` function, whose behavior cannot be assessed here, but this does not inherently imply malicious intent.",
