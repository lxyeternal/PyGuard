{
  "purpose": "The code provides a transliteration function for converting text between different Indic scripts and schemes, with optional auto-detection of the input scheme.",
  "sources": "The code reads input text via the 'text' parameter and potentially via the 'detect' function for auto-detection of script scheme.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs transliterated text and calls an external 'detect' function; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input text -> detect (if input_scheme is None) -> getattr to select schemes -> indic_transliterate -> output string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. Use of 'detect' function could be examined further if available, but based on this code alone, no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard transliteration tasks using well-defined library functions. It dynamically retrieves script schemes via 'getattr' and calls 'indic_transliterate'. The 'detect' function is used for auto-detection, which is common for script identification. No obfuscated code, network calls, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a typical utility function for transliteration without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward transliteration utility that employs standard libraries and functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. It appears safe and intended for legitimate transliteration purposes.",
