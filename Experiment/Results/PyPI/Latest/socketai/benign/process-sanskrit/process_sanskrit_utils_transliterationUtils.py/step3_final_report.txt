  "purpose": "Provides transliteration between Indic scripts and schemes, with optional auto-detection of input scheme.",
  "sources": "Reads input text and scheme identifiers; calls external 'detect' function for auto-detection.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; relies on external 'detect' for input scheme detection, but no data leaks or malicious data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input text flows from function argument; scheme detection may influence 'input_scheme'; transliteration output is returned.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic 'getattr' for scheme selection; external 'detect' function dependency; no suspicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward transliteration utility leveraging 'indic_transliteration'. It optionally auto-detects input script via an external 'detect' function. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The use of 'getattr' is standard for dynamic attribute access. External 'detect' function's trustworthiness is unknown but assumed benign. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent transliteration utility with no malicious or obfuscating features. External dependency on 'detect' does not introduce inherent risk based on available information. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect the low security concern.",
