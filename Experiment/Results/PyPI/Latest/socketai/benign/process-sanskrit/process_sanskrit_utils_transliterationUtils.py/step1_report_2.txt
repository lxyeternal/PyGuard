{
  "purpose": "To provide a function for transliterating text between different schemes, optionally auto-detecting the input scheme.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'text' and optional 'input_scheme' are sources of untrusted data; the 'detect' function also reads data to determine the scheme.",
  "sinks": "The 'indic_transliterate' function, which performs transliteration, acts as a sink that processes data potentially from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'text' (and optionally 'input_scheme') through detection (if input_scheme is None), then to 'indic_transliterate' which produces the output transliterated text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. The 'detect' function's implementation is external and not provided, so its behavior is unknown, but its usage here appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs transliteration by determining source and target schemes, optionally auto-detecting the source scheme using an external 'detect' function. It relies on 'indic_transliteration' library functions and standard Python practices. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are evident. The external detection function introduces some reliance on external code, but no malicious intent is apparent. The code processes data in a typical manner for transliteration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard transliteration utility that relies on established libraries and external detection. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on the provided code. The risk of supply chain attack is minimal unless the 'detect' function or 'indic_transliteration' library is compromised, which is outside the scope of this code review.",
