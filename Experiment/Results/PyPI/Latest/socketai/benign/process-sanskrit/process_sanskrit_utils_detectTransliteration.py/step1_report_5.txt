{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to automatically detect the transliteration scheme used in a given text, focusing on scripts within certain Unicode blocks and specific Romanization patterns.",
  "sources": "The input text provided to the detect() function, including text from files, user input, or external data sources.",
  "targets": "The detection logic primarily reads and analyzes the input text; no sensitive data handling or external outputs are directly performed.",
  "flows": "The function scans the input text for Unicode code points within specific ranges and for pattern matches using regular expressions, then returns a label indicating the identified scheme.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code are present. Regular expressions are straightforward, targeting specific character patterns for detection. No malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly identifies Unicode ranges corresponding to Brahmic scripts and matches specific Romanization patterns via regex. There is no indication of malicious payloads, external network activity, or data exfiltration. The use of regex and Unicode code point checks are standard and benign. No malicious code injection, backdoors, or malicious side effects are observed. The logic is focused solely on pattern detection within the input data.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, well-structured detection utility for transliteration schemes. It performs pattern matching and Unicode range checks without any malicious intent or malicious side effects. There are no security risks or malware indications in this code.",
