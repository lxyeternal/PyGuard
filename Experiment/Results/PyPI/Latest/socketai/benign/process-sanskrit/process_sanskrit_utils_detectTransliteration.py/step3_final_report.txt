{
  "purpose": "Detects the transliteration scheme used in a given text by checking Unicode ranges for Brahmic scripts and regex patterns for Romanization schemes such as IAST, ITRANS, Velthuis, SLP1, and Kolkata.",
  "sources": "Unicode code points in the text, regex pattern matches for specific Romanization characters and sequences.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data in a way that leads to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Text input is analyzed via Unicode point checks and regex searches; no external data or system modifications occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, pattern-based detection with no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs Unicode range checks for Indic scripts and regex pattern matching for Romanization schemes. It does not perform any external data access, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The regex patterns target specific character sequences associated with particular transliteration schemes. The code is simple, transparent, and domain-specific, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The detection logic is standard and safe, with no vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and consistent with the code's functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward transliteration detection utility that performs Unicode range checks and regex pattern matching without any malicious or obfuscated elements. All assessments and scores are accurate; the code poses no security risks.",
