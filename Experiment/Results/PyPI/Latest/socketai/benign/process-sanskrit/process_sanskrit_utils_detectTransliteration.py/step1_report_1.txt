{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to detect the transliteration scheme of given text data, specifically for scripts and Romanization systems related to Indian languages.",
  "sources": "The code reads input text data from the parameter 'text' in the detect() function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that output untrusted data to external systems, files, or network. The code only returns a string indicating the detected scheme.",
  "flows": "Input text is analyzed for Unicode code points and regex pattern matches to determine the scheme. No external or untrusted data is forwarded beyond returning the detection result.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual code patterns. It relies on standard Unicode range checks and regex pattern matching. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs Unicode code point analysis to identify Brahmic scripts within a specific Unicode range. It then uses several regex patterns to identify Romanization schemes like IAST, ITRANS, Velthuis, SLP1, and Kolkata. The detection logic is straightforward, matching specific Unicode ranges and regex patterns, then returning the corresponding scheme name. No external data is fetched, no file or network operations are performed, and there is no suspicious logic or obfuscation. The code appears to be a legitimate, domain-specific script for transliteration detection without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign, domain-specific tool for identifying transliteration schemes. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply performs pattern matching and Unicode range checks to classify text input. Therefore, it can be considered safe with no malware or security concerns.",
