{
  "purpose": "The code detects the transliteration scheme of input text, primarily for identifying scripts and romanization systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads input text data passed to the 'detect' function.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks that lead to data leaks, system modification, or external communication.",
  "flows": "The detection flow involves reading text, checking Unicode code points for Brahmic scripts, and pattern matching for Romanization schemes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The code performs standard regex pattern matching for classification purposes. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external communications are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script uses Unicode code point checks to identify Brahmic scripts and regex pattern matching to determine Romanization schemes. No malicious code or behaviors are detected; all operations are standard pattern matching and Unicode range checks. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious backdoors. The code appears to be a straightforward classification utility for transliteration schemes without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign transliteration scheme detector with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It performs pattern matching and Unicode checks for classification purposes only.",
