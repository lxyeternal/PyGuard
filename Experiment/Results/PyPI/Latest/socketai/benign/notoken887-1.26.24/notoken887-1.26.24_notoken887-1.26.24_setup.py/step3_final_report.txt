  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining metadata, packages, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Metadata fields such as author_email ('hitler@gmail.com') and url ('https://thugging.org'), and the entry point 'notoken887.main:main'.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of 'notoken887.main:main' which could contain malicious code if malicious, but not visible here.",
  "flows": "Setup process reads metadata and references the main function; actual code execution depends on the implementation of 'main'.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email and URL; description mentions obfuscation but none present; no dynamic or obfuscated code in this script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py with benign structure. Metadata contains red flags (author email and URL), but no malicious or obfuscated code is evident. The risk is primarily from the metadata and the referenced main function, which cannot be assessed here. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is moderate (~0.2-0.4) due to suspicious metadata. The setup script itself is safe, but further inspection of the package contents is advised.",
  "conclusion": "The setup code is benign and standard; the main concern is the suspicious metadata which could be used for malicious purposes if the package content or main function is malicious. No active malicious code or obfuscation detected in this script.",
