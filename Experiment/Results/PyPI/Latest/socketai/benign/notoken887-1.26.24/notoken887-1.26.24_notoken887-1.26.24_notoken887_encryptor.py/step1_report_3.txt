{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings using emoji replacements for characters.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings for encryption and encrypted strings for decryption via method parameters.",
  "sinks": "The methods perform string replacements only; no external data sinks or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through sequential replace calls in encrypt/decrypt methods; no external flows or untrusted data handling beyond these replacements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The replacement approach is straightforward and does not involve obfuscation or dynamic execution. No external dependencies or network activity are observed.",
  "analysis": "The class provides a reversible substitution cipher using emojis. The replace operations are static, hardcoded, and do not involve any external data sources, secrets, or dynamic code execution. The functions are symmetrical and only manipulate strings internally. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code is simple, predictable, and benign from a security standpoint.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a substitution cipher with emoji replacements. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, nor does it contain security risks or malware. The functions are straightforward and do not pose any threat.",
