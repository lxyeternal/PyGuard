{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple character replacement-based encryption and decryption functions, likely intended to obscure text data.",
  "sources": "The methods process input strings in the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' functions; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The functions output transformed strings; no untrusted sinks like network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed character-by-character through a series of replace operations in both encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward character replacements without any dynamic or obfuscated code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are detected. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or malicious system actions are evident.",
  "analysis": "The class offers simple substitution ciphers implemented via chained string replacements. Each encryption maps specific characters to emojis or special symbols; decryption reverses this mapping. The implementation is static, with explicit replace calls. No external data sources, user input handling beyond string parameter, or system interactions are present. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected. The approach is rudimentary and could be used for basic obfuscation but does not involve any security-sensitive operations or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic character substitution cipher for obfuscation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms. Its security risk score is low, and it appears to be benign.",
