{
  "purpose": "The code provides simple character substitution encryption and decryption methods for obfuscating strings using emoji mappings.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to encrypt() and encrypted tokens provided to decrypt() functions.",
  "sinks": "Return values of encrypt() and decrypt() functions; no data is sent or stored elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input string -> encrypt() replaces characters with emojis -> output encrypted string; Encrypted string -> decrypt() reverses emojis to characters -> output original string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. The code solely performs character replacements.",
  "analysis": "The class performs straightforward character substitution, replacing alphanumeric characters and some punctuation with emojis and vice versa. There are no external data sources, network calls, or file operations. No malicious code or malicious behavior is evident. The functions are deterministic and solely operate on input strings. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The implementation is simple and transparent, serving as a reversible cipher based on emoji mapping.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign character substitution cipher with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code and only performs predefined replacements. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
