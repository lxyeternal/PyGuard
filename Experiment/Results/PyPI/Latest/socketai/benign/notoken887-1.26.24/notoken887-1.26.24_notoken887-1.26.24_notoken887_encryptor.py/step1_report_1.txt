{
  "purpose": "The code provides simple character substitution-based encryption and decryption functions for strings, mapping specific characters to emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the encrypt and decrypt methods, which are then processed through sequential character replacements.",
  "sinks": "The replaced characters are returned as output; no external data sinks such as network or file I/O are present.",
  "flows": "Input string → character replacement in encrypt method → output encrypted string; Encrypted string → character replacement in decrypt method → output original string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The implementation is straightforward and solely performs character substitutions.",
  "analysis": "The class performs reversible character substitutions for encoding and decoding strings. There are no external data sources, no untrusted input handling beyond direct method input, and no network or system interactions. The replacements are static and predefined, serving purely as a simple cipher without any malicious intent. No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are evident. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a basic reversible cipher for strings using emoji substitutions. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It appears to be an innocuous, simple encoding utility with no security risks or supply chain vulnerabilities.",
