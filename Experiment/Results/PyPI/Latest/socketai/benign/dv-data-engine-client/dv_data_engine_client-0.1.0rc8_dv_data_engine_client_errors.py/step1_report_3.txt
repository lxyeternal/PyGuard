{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception for handling unexpected API response statuses",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'status_code' and 'content' in the constructor",
  "sinks": "String formatting in the exception message which may include content decoded from bytes",
  "flows": "Input data (status_code, content) flows into exception message construction and potential logging or display",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; straightforward exception class with safe decoding",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple exception class 'UnexpectedStatus' that captures the status code and response content when an API response status is unexpected. It safely decodes the response content with error handling, preventing decode errors from crashing. The class is used for error handling within an API client, and there are no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not process untrusted data in a dangerous manner nor performs any network or file operations. The usage of exception handling and string formatting appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign custom exception class used for error reporting in API clients. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.",
