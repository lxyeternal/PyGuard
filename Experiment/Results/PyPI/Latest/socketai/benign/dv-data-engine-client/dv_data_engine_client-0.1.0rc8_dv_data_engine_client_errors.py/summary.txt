  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward exception class used for API error handling. The only minor security consideration is the inclusion of response content in exception messages, which could leak sensitive data if responses are untrusted. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior, and the scores are appropriate."
