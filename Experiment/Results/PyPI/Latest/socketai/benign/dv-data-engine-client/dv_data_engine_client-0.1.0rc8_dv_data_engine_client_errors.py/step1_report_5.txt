  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling unexpected API response statuses",
  "sources": "The class raises an exception with status_code and content attributes, and encodes the content in the error message",
  "sinks": "The content attribute may contain data from API responses, which could potentially include sensitive information",
  "flows": "Exception initialization captures API response data (status_code and content) and formats it into an error message",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behaviors detected; the class performs standard exception handling",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward custom exception for API error handling, capturing response status and content, and formatting an error message. No user input processing, external data fetching, or insecure patterns are present. The exception message includes API response content which might contain sensitive data if the API responses include such information, but this is typical for error reporting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class for API error handling with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply captures and formats API response data into an exception message.",
