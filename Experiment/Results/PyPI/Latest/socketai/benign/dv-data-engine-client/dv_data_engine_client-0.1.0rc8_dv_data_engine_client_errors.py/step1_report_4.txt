  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling unexpected API response statuses.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code is solely defining a class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the class only processes and raises an exception with provided parameters.",
  "flows": "Exception initialization uses status_code and content parameters, with content decoded for message; no external flows or data manipulation beyond exception message creation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class with safe decoding.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward custom exception class for API error handling, including safe decoding of response content for error messages. There are no suspicious code patterns, external data reads, or security-sensitive operations. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures are present. The code's structure and content are typical for error handling in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign exception class for API response errors with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
