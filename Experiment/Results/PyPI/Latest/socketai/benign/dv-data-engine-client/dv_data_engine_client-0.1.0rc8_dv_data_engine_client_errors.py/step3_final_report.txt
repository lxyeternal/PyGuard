{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class 'UnexpectedStatus' for handling unexpected API response status codes, storing the status code and response content, and constructing an error message.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'status_code' and 'content' passed to the constructor; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "The exception message including 'content.decode(errors=\"ignore\")', which could potentially leak sensitive data if the response contains confidential information.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'status_code' and 'content' flow into the exception object; the 'content' is decoded and included in the error message, which may be logged or displayed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward exception class. The inclusion of response content in error messages could leak sensitive data, but this is a common practice in error reporting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple, standard custom exception for API error handling, capturing response status and content. It does not perform network, file, or external data operations, nor does it contain hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The only potential security concern is that the exception message includes response content, which could leak sensitive information if the API response contains such data. The scores across reports are consistent, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1) due to potential data leakage. The code is benign and aligns with typical error handling patterns; no malicious behavior or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward exception class used for API error handling. The only minor security consideration is the inclusion of response content in exception messages, which could leak sensitive data if responses are untrusted. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior, and the scores are appropriate.",
