{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling unexpected API response statuses.",
  "sources": "The class constructor takes in status_code (int) and content (bytes) as parameters.",
  "sinks": "The exception message involves decoding the bytes content, which could potentially process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (status_code, content) flow into the exception message via decoding, but do not cause external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The content is decoded with error ignoring, which is standard practice for handling byte data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class with an initializer that formats an error message including decoded response content. The decoding ignores errors, which is safe and common for handling bytes that may contain invalid characters. No input/output, external network interactions, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code appears purely for error handling related to API responses.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and serves to raise exceptions for unexpected API statuses. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a standard, benign implementation.",
