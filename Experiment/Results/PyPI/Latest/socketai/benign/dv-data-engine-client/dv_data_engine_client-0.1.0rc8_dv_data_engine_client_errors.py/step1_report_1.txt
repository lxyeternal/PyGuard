  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling unexpected API response statuses.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs an exception message that includes response content, which could potentially leak sensitive data if content contains such information.",
  "flows": "N/A; no external data flows are evident in this static code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward exception class with safe usage. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception class to handle unexpected HTTP status responses. It stores the status code and response content, then constructs an error message that includes the response content. There are no inputs from external untrusted sources within this snippet, nor does it perform any data processing beyond string formatting. The content is decoded with errors ignored, which is standard. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe exception class for API error handling. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
