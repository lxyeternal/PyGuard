{
  "purpose": "Define shared data structures and types for property handling, including file uploads and generic responses",
  "sources": "Constants (UNSET), class attributes (payload, file_name, mime_type, status_code, content, headers, parsed), method parameters (payload, file_name, mime_type, status_code, content, headers, parsed)",
  "sinks": "to_tuple() method returning a tuple for HTTP multipart/form-data submission",
  "flows": "File.to_tuple() uses file_name, payload, mime_type; Response class holds response data and headers, with optional parsed content",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data structures for handling HTTP responses and file uploads using attrs. The UNSET singleton is used for optional unset values. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The to_tuple method formats data for HTTP requests, which is standard practice. Overall, this code is straightforward and does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, well-structured data definition module with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It serves as utility code for handling HTTP responses and file uploads, with no suspicious or malicious actions observed.",
