{
  "purpose": "Shared type definitions for properties, including file uploads and generic response handling.",
  "sources": "Constants, class definitions, and type annotations that do not process untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no processing of untrusted data leads to security impact.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; code mainly defines data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The UNSET singleton is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes and types for handling responses and file uploads. It uses type annotations, attrs for class definitions, and static structures. No input parsing, no untrusted data processing, no network operations, or system commands are present. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and appears to serve as a support module without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of data structure definitions for handling file uploads and HTTP responses. It does not contain malicious behaviors, security risks, or obfuscated code. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.",
