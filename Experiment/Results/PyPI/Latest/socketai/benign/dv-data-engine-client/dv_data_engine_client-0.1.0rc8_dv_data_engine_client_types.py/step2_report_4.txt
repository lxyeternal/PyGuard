  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the presence of issues, the validity of the reasoning, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- The code defines data structures for handling HTTP responses and file uploads.\n- Uses attrs for class definitions.\n- Includes an UNSET singleton for optional values.\n- No external input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports conclude that the code is straightforward, with no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no security risks. This aligns with the code's actual content.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  The reports are consistent, detailed, and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is purely structural, with no suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which seems appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of the Scores:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports give 0, which is justified. No malicious code, backdoors, or harmful behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports give 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  All reports give 0, which is correct since the code does not perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Confidence Level:**  \n  All reports have confidence 1, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Considerations:\n\n- **Is there any reason to assign a higher risk score?**  \n  No. The code is purely structural, with no external input processing, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no secrets.\n\n- **Are there any assumptions or potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  The reports correctly challenge any assumptions, noting that the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Is the use of attrs appropriate?**  \n  Yes, attrs is used for data classes, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, **the scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and justified**. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My Own Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the actual code content.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and correctly score the security aspects. The code is a benign, utility module defining data structures for HTTP responses and file uploads. No issues warranting concern are present.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed to the reports or scores. The code is safe, straightforward, and well-understood.",
