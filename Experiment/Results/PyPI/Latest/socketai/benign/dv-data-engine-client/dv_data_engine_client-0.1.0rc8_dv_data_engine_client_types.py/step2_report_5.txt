  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is straightforward, defining data structures for handling file uploads and HTTP responses.\n- They uniformly state that no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The code uses standard libraries and patterns, with no signs of suspicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, indicating no malicious intent detected.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, confirming the code is clear and understandable.\n- The security risk score is 0, aligned with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Confirming the code:**\n- The code is purely defining data classes and constants.\n- No external input handling, no network operations, no code execution, and no sensitive data processing are present.\n- The use of `attrs` for data classes is standard.\n- The `UNSET` singleton pattern is common for optional unset values.\n- The `to_tuple()` method formats data for HTTP multipart uploads, which is standard.\n\n**Logical flaws or anomalies:**\n- None are evident. The code appears well-structured, with clear intent.\n- No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond what is shown.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- The malware score remains at 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- The security risk score remains at 0, as the code is purely structural.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a benign utility module for data modeling.\n- No adjustments to the scores are necessary.\n- The reports' conclusions are accurate and justified.\n\n**My final estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code snippet is safe, well-structured, and free of security issues. It serves as a typical data model for API interactions, with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
