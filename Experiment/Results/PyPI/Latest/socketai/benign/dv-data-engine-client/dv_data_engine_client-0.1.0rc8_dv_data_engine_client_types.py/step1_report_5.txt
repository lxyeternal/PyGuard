{
  "purpose": "Shared types and classes for property management, including file uploads and HTTP responses",
  "sources": "No user input or external data sources are explicitly read within this code; it defines data structures and constants",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks are present; the code does not perform data output or external communications",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code mainly defines data containers and constants",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs observed; use of attrs for data classes is standard",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple data structures for handling file uploads and HTTP responses, with no dynamic code execution, no external data reading, and no sensitive information handling. The UNSET singleton provides a way to represent optional unset states. All classes and constants are standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is straightforward, defining data structures and constants for typical application use. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious anomalies, or security risks present.",
