{
  "purpose": "Defines shared types and classes for handling file uploads and HTTP responses in a property-related application.",
  "sources": "Reads data from imported modules (collections.abc, http, typing, attrs) and class attributes such as 'payload', 'file_name', 'mime_type', 'status_code', 'content', 'headers', 'parsed'.",
  "sinks": "Uses data in 'to_tuple()' method for HTTP multipart/form-data; uses 'headers' in HTTP responses; possibly reads input data for file uploads.",
  "flows": "Input data (file payloads, headers, response content) flows through class attributes and methods, with no evident untrusted data flow or external input manipulation in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present. No use of dynamic code execution or malicious API calls.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of data structures and type definitions for handling files and responses. It employs standard libraries and a third-party attrs library. There are no signs of malicious code, suspicious data handling, or security risks. It does not perform any network activity, data storage, or sensitive operations. The use of 'payload' as a BinaryIO in 'File' is normal for file uploads, with no evident malicious intent. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, harmless data model setup for managing file uploads and HTTP responses. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward and safe.",
