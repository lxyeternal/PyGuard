{
  "purpose": "Defines shared data types and classes for properties, including file upload representation and generic response structure.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or untrusted data sources directly; class attributes and constants are defined internally.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data manipulation or output; no network, file, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable within this code; data is encapsulated within class methods and attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides data type definitions and class structures for handling files and responses in an API context. No external input handling, data transmission, or processing occurs here. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The code appears to serve a utility role without side effects or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves as a data model module for API properties. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security issues.",
