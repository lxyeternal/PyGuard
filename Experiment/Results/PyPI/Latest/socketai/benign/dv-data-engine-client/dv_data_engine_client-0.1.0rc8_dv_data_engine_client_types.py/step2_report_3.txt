  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**1. Code Content Review:**\n\n- The code defines data structures for handling HTTP responses (`Response`) and file uploads (`File`), along with a singleton `UNSET` for optional unset values.\n- Uses standard libraries (`collections.abc`, `http`, `typing`) and the third-party `attrs` library for class definitions.\n- No dynamic code execution, no input parsing, no network or system calls.\n- The `File.to_tuple()` method formats data for multipart/form-data uploads.\n- The `Response` class encapsulates response data, headers, and optional parsed content.\n\n**2. Presence of Issues or Malicious Behavior:**\n\n- The code is purely structural, serving as utility data models.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- No suspicious data flows, external input handling, or network operations.\n- The `UNSET` singleton is a common pattern for optional values.\n\n**3. Logical Flaws or Mistakes:**\n\n- The code appears correct, well-structured, and free of errors.\n- The use of `attrs` is appropriate and standard.\n- The `to_tuple()` method correctly formats data for HTTP multipart uploads.\n\n**4. Scores and Reasoning:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0. The code does not contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or harmful behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0. The code is utility and data definition only, with no security vulnerabilities or risky operations.\n\n**5. Consistency and Justification:**\n\n- The reports uniformly agree that the code is benign, with confidence level 1.\n- No reason to adjust scores; they are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**6. Final Assessment:**\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is safe, non-malicious, and purely structural.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security vulnerabilities or risky behavior)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus in the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard, well-structured utility module for handling HTTP responses and file uploads, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
