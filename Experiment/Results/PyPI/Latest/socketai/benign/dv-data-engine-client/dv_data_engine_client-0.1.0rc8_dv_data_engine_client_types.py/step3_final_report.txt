  "purpose": "Defines data structures for file uploads and HTTP responses used in API interactions.",
  "sources": "None; static data definitions, no input reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "None; purely data modeling with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward data classes for handling files and responses, utilizing attrs for clarity. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or secret handling. The singleton UNSET is a common pattern. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is purely structural and utility-focused.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or security-risk behaviors. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified given its simplicity and purpose.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
