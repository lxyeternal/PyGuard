{
  "purpose": "This code provides a client library interface for accessing the DataEngine API, exporting two classes for authentication and client functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports from a relative module (.client), which may contain the core implementation of the classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to external systems are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data handling are visible; the code primarily defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are present. The code is straightforward and standard for a library module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from a local module and exposes them via __all__ for external use. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues within this snippet. Since it only involves imports and exports, it doesn't process data directly or include risky constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and serves as a simple interface for the client library. No malicious activity or security concerns are evident from this minimal code segment.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
