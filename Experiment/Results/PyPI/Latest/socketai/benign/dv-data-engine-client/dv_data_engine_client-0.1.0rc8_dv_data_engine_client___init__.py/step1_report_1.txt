  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for clients to access the DataEngine API by importing classes from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from a local module (.client import AuthenticatedClient, Client).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling or network operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; only class imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain any suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that re-exports classes from a local client module for API access. It contains only import statements and an explicit __all__ declaration, with no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard module initialization file with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
