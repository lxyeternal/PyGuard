  "purpose": "This code provides a client library interface for accessing the DataEngine API by exporting classes from a module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local module '.client' that import 'AuthenticatedClient' and 'Client'.",
  "sinks": "None present in this code snippet; no untrusted data sources or data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code primarily exports classes for external use.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports two classes and re-exports them for use. It contains no dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or network operations. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious activity. The code serves as an API client interface setup, which is typical in Python libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving only as a re-export of classes from a local module without any malicious intent or security risks.",
