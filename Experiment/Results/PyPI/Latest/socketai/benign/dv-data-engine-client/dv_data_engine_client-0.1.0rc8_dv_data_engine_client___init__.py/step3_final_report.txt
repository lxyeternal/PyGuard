  "purpose": "A client library for accessing DataEngine API",

  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only re-exports classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing classes from a local module and defining __all__ for exports. It contains no data handling, network activity, or logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless module used for class re-export. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; minor overcautiousness in one case (security risk 0.1) can be adjusted to 0 for consistency.",
