{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports client classes for accessing the DataEngine API.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes from a local module (.client). No external input reading detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; no untrusted data processing or output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily establishes exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, importing classes and defining exports. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues are evident. The code does not include input handling, network communication, or cryptographic operations. It appears to be a simple module setup with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module defining client classes for API access, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
