  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports confirm that the provided snippets contain only comments or docstrings with no executable code, data handling, or logic. Therefore, there are no sources, sinks, flows, or potential vulnerabilities to evaluate. This is consistent across all reports.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are accurate in stating that the snippets are just descriptive comments. No mistakes are evident in their reasoning. They correctly identify the absence of code, data flows, or suspicious activity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- Obfuscated: All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate given the lack of code or obfuscation.  \n- Malware: All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which aligns with the absence of executable code or malicious indicators.  \n- Security Risk: All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given no code execution or data handling.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**  \nSince all snippets are just comments with no code, any risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The current scores reflect this correctly.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations**  \nThe malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate. There is no evidence of malicious activity or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about potential vulnerabilities, given the minimal content.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent with the content: no code, no data, no risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation present.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk, as the snippet contains only a comment.\n\n### Summary\n\nGiven the complete absence of executable code or data handling, **the overall risk is negligible**, and the scores assigned are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted based on these snippets.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.  \n- No changes needed.\n\n**Note:** If in future, actual code is added, re-evaluate for sources, sinks, flows, and potential malicious indicators.",
