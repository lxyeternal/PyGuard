  "purpose": "Contains methods for accessing the API",
  "sources": "None (no code that reads input or data)",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data handling or output functions)",
  "flows": "No data flow present due to absence of code",
  "anomalies": "Lack of actual implementation, only a comment; no suspicious or unusual code observed",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet contains only a docstring comment describing that it includes methods for accessing an API. There is no executable code, data handling, or logic present. Without actual code, no sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies can be identified. This minimal snippet does not perform any operations, access data, or execute any potentially malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is essentially a placeholder or comment with no functional content. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. Given the absence of code, there are no security concerns to report.",
