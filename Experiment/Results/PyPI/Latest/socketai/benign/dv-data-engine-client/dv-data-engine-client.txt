      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless module used for class re-export. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; minor overcautiousness in one case (security risk 0.1) can be adjusted to 0 for consistency."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward exception class used for API error handling. The only minor security consideration is the inclusion of response content in exception messages, which could leak sensitive data if responses are untrusted. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior, and the scores are appropriate."

The only minor security concern is the optional disabling of SSL verification, which is appropriately documented and should be used cautiously. Overall, the code is trustworthy and suitable for use in production with proper SSL configuration."
