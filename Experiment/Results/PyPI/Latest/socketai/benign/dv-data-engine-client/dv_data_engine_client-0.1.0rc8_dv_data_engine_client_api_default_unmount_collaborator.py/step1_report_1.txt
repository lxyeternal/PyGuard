{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to unmount a collaborator via HTTP DELETE requests, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'collaborator_id' parameter for URL construction, and responses from the HTTP request, including status code, headers, and JSON content.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effects could occur if untrusted data is improperly handled, such as logging response content or headers, but no such sinks are present. The code does not directly process untrusted input beyond URL construction.",
  "flows": "Input 'collaborator_id' flows into URL for HTTP request. The response is parsed based on status code; 200 returns None, 404 deserializes a response object, others may raise exceptions. The flow is straightforward and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution present. No suspicious network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The code relies on standard libraries and predictable patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical API client implementation for deleting a collaborator. It constructs HTTP requests, handles responses with appropriate status code checks, and raises exceptions on unexpected statuses. There are no signs of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or malicious data handling. It uses standard HTTP methods and response parsing. The response parsing safely deserializes JSON only for 404 responses. No suspicious code flow, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client module for unmounting collaborators, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured client implementation with proper error handling and no signs of malware.",
