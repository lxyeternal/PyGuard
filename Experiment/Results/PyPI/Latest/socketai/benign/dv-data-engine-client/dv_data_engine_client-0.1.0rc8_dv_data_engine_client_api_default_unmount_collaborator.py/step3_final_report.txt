  "purpose": "API client function to unmount a collaborator via HTTP DELETE request, handling responses for success (200) and not found (404).",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'collaborator_id' used in URL construction; response data from HTTP response.",
  "sinks": "Response parsing and exception raising based on response status; no untrusted data sinks or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'collaborator_id' flows into URL; HTTP request sent; response received; status code checked; response data parsed; exceptions raised if unexpected status.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'cast(Any, None)' for 200 response is unconventional but harmless; no other anomalies or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an HTTP DELETE request to remove a collaborator, handles responses for 200 and 404 status codes, raises exceptions for unexpected statuses if configured, and supports both sync and async operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. Response handling is standard, and the code uses typical libraries and patterns. The odd cast statement does not introduce security issues. Overall, the code is a benign API client with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured API client for unmounting collaborators, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assessments and scores across reports are consistent and appropriate.",
