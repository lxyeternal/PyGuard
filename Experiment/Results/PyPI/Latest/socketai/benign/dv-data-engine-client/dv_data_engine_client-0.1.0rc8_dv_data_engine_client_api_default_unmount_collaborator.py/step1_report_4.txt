{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to perform an HTTP DELETE request to unmount a collaborator by ID, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'collaborator_id' input parameter, constructs request parameters, and processes HTTP responses including JSON parsing.",
  "sinks": "The response handling may involve parsing JSON data, but no untrusted data is directly used in dangerous operations. No data leaks or dangerous actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'collaborator_id' is used to build URL, request is sent, response is parsed to either None, a data class, or an error. No malicious flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs observed. The code structure is straightforward, and the request logic is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code securely constructs HTTP request parameters based on input, handles responses based on status codes, and raises exceptions for unexpected statuses if configured. No suspicious code paths, no obfuscated code, or embedded malicious behavior. The use of casting and JSON parsing appears standard. No evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard API client function for unmounting collaborators, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It operates within typical patterns for API request handling.",
