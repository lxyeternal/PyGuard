  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward API client for unmounting a collaborator, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Key points:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malware, standard response handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Reasonable given the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Slightly above zero, but justified given the code's simplicity.\n- **Observation:** The risk score of 0.1 might be conservative; the code is benign, so perhaps 0 is more appropriate unless considering external factors.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard API client, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The confidence is high (1).\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent with the code; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard pattern, no anomalies or secrets, straightforward request handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Again, very low, justified by the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others; standard API client, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which aligns with the code's content—no malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign 0 or 0.1, which seems reasonable given the benign nature. The slightly elevated risk scores (0.1) are conservative, possibly accounting for the fact that the code performs network requests, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no inherent security risks identified; network requests are standard.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nThe use of `cast(Any, None)` for response 200 is somewhat odd but harmless; it does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The code is a typical API client pattern.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | 0              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0              |\n| Security Risk  | 0              |\n\nThe reports are consistent, and the code appears benign. No further action or concern is necessary.",
