  "anomalies": "No code provided beyond a descriptive comment; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment describing endpoint functions for an API, with no executable code, data handling, or logic visible. Without actual implementation, there are no apparent sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies to analyze. The snippet is trivial and does not include any security-sensitive operations or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a placeholder or documentation comment without executable content.",
