  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no data output, network calls, or file writes observed",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are evident due to absence of detailed code",
  "anomalies": "Lack of implementation details; no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is a minimal comment indicating endpoint functions for an API. Without actual implementation details, there are no apparent sources, sinks, or malicious behaviors. The snippet is too generic to assess any security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited content, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a placeholder or descriptive comment with no executable logic.",
