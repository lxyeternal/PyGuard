  "purpose": "Define classes for managing HTTP clients with support for authentication, SSL verification, and context management using the httpx library.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters for configuration (base_url, cookies, headers, timeout, verify_ssl, follow_redirects, httpx_args), method calls that set or modify clients, token and header settings for authentication.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request execution via get_httpx_client and get_async_httpx_client methods, context manager methods (__enter__, __exit__, __aenter__, __aexit__), setting headers and cookies, creating httpx.Client and httpx.AsyncClient instances.",
  "flows": "Initialization and configuration parameters -> get_httpx_client/get_async_httpx_client -> request execution (not shown but implied) -> context management (enter/exit) -> modifications via with_headers, with_cookies, with_timeout -> setting manual clients.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials aside from token and headers, which are standard for authenticated clients. No suspicious code patterns such as data exfiltration, network connections outside expected usage, or obfuscation. Use of SSL verification toggle is typical, though setting verify_ssl=False could pose security risks, but not malicious intent. No evidence of malicious code injection or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements HTTP client management with support for SSL verification, headers, cookies, timeouts, and context managers, which are common features. The token-based authentication approach is standard and safe provided tokens are managed securely outside. The code does not contain any network connections or data exfiltration routines, nor does it perform malicious actions. No obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The only potential security concern is the optional disablement of SSL verification, which is a common risk but not malicious in itself.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of HTTP client wrappers with support for authentication and configuration. It does not include any malicious behavior or malware signatures. The structure and behavior are consistent with safe, typical usage for API clients. Therefore, the overall security risk is low.",
