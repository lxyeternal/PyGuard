  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is a standard API client for querying collaborator info, with proper error handling and no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code performs typical request/response handling, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API request flow, no malicious behavior, and proper handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, with no suspicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are justified. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is a typical API client. The reviewer notes that setting 'Content-Type' in a GET request is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity, just a minor unconventional header setting.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern, standard API client, no malicious behavior, proper error handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are justified.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, notes the unconventional 'Content-Type' header in GET, but considers it non-malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concern, which is justified given the code's nature.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — 0.2, reflecting a very low security risk, primarily due to unconventional headers but not malicious.\n\n**Note:** The only minor anomaly is the setting of 'Content-Type' in a GET request, which is unconventional but not harmful.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and reasonable. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured API client with no malicious intent. The scores are justified and should remain as they are.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is safe, and the scoring reflects that accurately.",
