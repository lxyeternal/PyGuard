  "purpose": "API client functions for querying collaborator information via HTTP requests, handling responses and errors.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (collaborator_id, body), response content (response.json(), response.text).",
  "sinks": "Response parsing (from_dict methods, response.text), potential data leaks if response content is malicious.",
  "flows": "Request construction in _get_kwargs -> HTTP request via client -> Response received -> _parse_response -> _build_response.",
  "anomalies": "Setting 'Content-Type' header in a GET request, which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API request-response handling with proper error management. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Response parsing is straightforward. The only minor anomaly is the use of 'Content-Type' in a GET request, which is unconventional but not harmful. Response handling and data flow are typical for such API clients. No signs of malicious activity or backdoors are present. The malware score is justified as 0, indicating no malicious intent. Obfuscation score is 0, reflecting code clarity. The security risk score could be slightly lowered to 0.1, considering the minor anomaly, but overall remains low.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured API client with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are appropriate; however, the risk could be marginally reduced to 0.1. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
