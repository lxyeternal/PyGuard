  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured API client with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are appropriate; however, the risk could be marginally reduced to 0.1. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
