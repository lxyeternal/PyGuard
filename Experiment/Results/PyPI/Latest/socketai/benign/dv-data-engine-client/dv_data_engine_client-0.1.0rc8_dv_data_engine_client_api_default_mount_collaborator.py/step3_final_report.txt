  "purpose": "API client functions for mounting a collaborator, supporting sync and async operations with response parsing and error handling.",
  "sources": "HTTP request construction (_get_kwargs), response JSON parsing (response.json()), response status code checks.",
  "sinks": "Response handling and parsing, no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Request constructed in _get_kwargs() → sent via client request → response received and parsed in _parse_response() → returned through _build_response() → final output in sync/async functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. Standard request/response handling. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client for mounting collaborators, with request setup, response parsing based on status codes, and error handling. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. Response models are used for error responses, and the code structure is typical for such clients. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The response handling is standard, and no untrusted data sinks are evident beyond normal network interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign API client with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with typical network interaction code. The assessments in the reports are accurate and justified.",
