  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the potential security implications, ensuring consistency between the code and the report assessments.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a typical API client for mounting collaborators, with functions supporting sync/async operations, request construction, response parsing, and error handling.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The response handling is based on standard HTTP status codes, with models for specific error responses.\n- The request payload is constructed from a data class (`MountCollaboratorBody`) serialized to JSON.\n- No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 1\n**Report summary:**\n- Purpose: Standard API client for mounting collaborators.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no malicious behavior.\n- The security risk score of 0.2 is reasonable, considering network interactions always carry some inherent risk, but nothing malicious is detected.\n- Malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report's conclusion and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 2\n**Report summary:**\n- Purpose: Functions for mounting a collaborator, supporting sync/async.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No malicious indicators.\n- The low security risk score aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report's assessment and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 3\n**Report summary:**\n- Purpose: HTTP requests for mounting collaborators.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is standard, with no suspicious behaviors.\n- The security risk score is slightly higher but still reasonable given network operations.\n- Malware score remains 0, consistent with analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report's evaluation is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 4\n**Report summary:**\n- Purpose: HTTP request handling for mounting collaborators.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n- Confidence: 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- The security risk score is appropriate.\n- Malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report's conclusion and scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 5\n**Report summary:**\n- Purpose: HTTP request functions for mounting collaborators.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code appears standard and benign.\n- The security risk score is appropriate.\n- Malware score remains 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report's assessment is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Overall Evaluation:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a standard API client with no malicious intent.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting typical network interaction risks without evidence of malicious activity.\n- The confidence levels are high, aligning with the static analysis.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (standard network operations, minimal risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No modifications are necessary. The code is a typical, secure API client implementation with no signs of supply chain or malware issues.",
