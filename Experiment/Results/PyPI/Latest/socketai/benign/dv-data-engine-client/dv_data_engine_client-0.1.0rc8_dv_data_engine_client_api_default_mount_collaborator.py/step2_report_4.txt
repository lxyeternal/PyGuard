  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code to verify claims, assess the reasoning, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API client for mounting collaborators, with no malicious code or obfuscation detected.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks beyond typical API interaction.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is thorough and consistent with the code. The code performs straightforward request handling, response parsing, and error management. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard request/response handling with no malicious behaviors.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code and previous report. The reasoning aligns with the static code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code performs HTTP POST requests to mount collaborators, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behaviors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard HTTP request handling, no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code constructs or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Typical client library for mounting collaborators, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid and aligned.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code is straightforward, with no malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the clear, standard code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal concern. The code is a typical API client with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious features.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are unjustified.\n- The code's static analysis indicates no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code or behaviors detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, typical for standard API client code)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the code appears safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.",
