  "purpose": "This code provides functions to make HTTP POST requests to export collaborator data via an API, including synchronous and asynchronous methods, response parsing, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments (collaborator_id), and from response objects (response.json(), response.content).",
  "sinks": "Request construction uses collaborator_id in URL; response parsing interprets server responses. No data leaks or untrusted data usage evident.",
  "flows": "Function arguments (collaborator_id) flow into request URL construction. Responses from HTTP requests flow into response parsing functions, which interpret status codes and content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward API request handling with standard practices. No obfuscated code or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions to generate request parameters, parse responses based on status codes, and build response objects. The main functions perform synchronous and asynchronous HTTP POST requests to an endpoint involving a collaborator ID. Error handling is based on status codes, with optional exception raising. The usage of the collaborator_id in URL is standard; response parsing uses model methods. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious code flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign API client implementation for exporting collaborator data. It does not contain malware, malicious data handling, or security risks. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
