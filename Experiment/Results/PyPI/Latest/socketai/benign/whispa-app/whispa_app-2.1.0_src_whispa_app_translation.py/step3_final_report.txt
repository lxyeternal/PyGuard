{
  "purpose": "Provides multilingual translation using Hugging Face models with caching and chunking.",
  "sources": "Model repository URLs, environment info via select_device(), input text split into chunks.",
  "sinks": "Decoded translation output, model loading from local or remote sources.",
  "flows": "Input text -> chunking -> tokenizer encoding -> model generation -> decoding -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity beyond model loading.",
  "analysis": "The code loads translation models securely, caches them, handles large inputs via chunking, and performs translation without suspicious patterns. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected. The use of select_device() is standard for hardware optimization. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are justified given the code's nature and external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured translation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and should be maintained.",
