{
  "purpose": "This code performs language translation using pre-trained MarianMT models from Hugging Face Transformers, supporting multiple languages and handling text chunking.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os), system info (sys), and model repositories (MODEL_MAP). Loads models and tokenizers from local directories or remote repositories. Receives input text and target language.",
  "sinks": "Uses tokenizer and model for text generation; potentially decodes model outputs. Calls select_device() which may access hardware info. No explicit sinks for network or file access in the code.",
  "flows": "Input text -> split into chunks -> tokenize -> generate translation -> decode -> concatenate output. Data flows from input to model and tokenizer, with progress callback receiving progress info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of model loading and inference is standard. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or dynamic execution. No hidden data exfiltration or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads translation models from either local directories or remote repositories, then tokenizes input text, generates translations, and decodes outputs. The use of select_device() suggests hardware-aware optimization. All operations are typical for NLP pipelines. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of language translation using Hugging Face models. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or malicious payloads. The overall security risk is very low.",
