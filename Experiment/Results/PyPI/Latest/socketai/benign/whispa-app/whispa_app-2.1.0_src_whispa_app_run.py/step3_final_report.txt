  "purpose": "Utility script to prefetch ML models and launch the application.",
  "sources": "Model download functions (`get_whisper_model`, `get_translation_model`), command-line arguments, external repositories for models.",
  "sinks": "Network requests during model download, application launch routines.",
  "flows": "Command-line input triggers model prefetch or app launch; model functions access external URLs; app launches.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing trusted functions to download models and launch an app. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or backdoors are present. The functions likely access external repositories, which is standard for ML workflows. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the script. External network activity during model download is typical and not inherently risky. No evidence suggests malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for prefetching models and launching an application. The scores and assessments are justified and align with the code's behavior. No malicious activity or security threats are detected.",
