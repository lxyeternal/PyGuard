{
  "purpose": "To normalize whitespace in a text string and truncate it to a maximum length.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' for the string to process.",
  "sinks": "The return statement outputs the processed string; no external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows through re.sub to normalize whitespace, then is stripped and sliced to max_len.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs standard string operations with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 're', uses re.sub with a simple whitespace pattern to replace multiple whitespace characters with a single space, strips leading and trailing whitespace, and slices the string to 'max_len'. It performs no external I/O, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The operations are straightforward and safe. All reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the code's simplicity and functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for whitespace normalization and truncation. All assessments and scores are consistent and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
