{
  "purpose": "To clean and truncate a given text string by removing excessive whitespace and limiting the length.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text', which is provided externally when the function is called.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data to external systems or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is processed with regex substitution, then truncated and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns are present. The regex operation is standard; no obfuscation or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The function uses a regular expression to replace multiple whitespace characters with a single space and strips leading/trailing spaces. It then slices the cleaned string to a maximum length. The code is straightforward and does not include any network access, file I/O, or dynamic execution. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code performs a simple text normalization and truncation task, common in many applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs a standard text processing operation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
