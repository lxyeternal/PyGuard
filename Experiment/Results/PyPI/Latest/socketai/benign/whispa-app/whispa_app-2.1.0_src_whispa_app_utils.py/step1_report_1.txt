{
  "purpose": "The function 'simplify_text' aims to clean and truncate input text by removing excess whitespace and limiting the length.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'text' is read at the start of the function.",
  "sinks": "The function does not write data to external locations or perform any I/O that could lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is processed by the regex substitution and then truncated; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The regex and string slicing are standard operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic text normalization by replacing multiple whitespace characters with a single space and removing leading/trailing whitespace. It then limits the output length to a maximum of 2000 characters. There are no external calls, no data exfiltration, and no dynamic execution. The use of 're.sub' with a simple pattern is safe. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple text processing utility that normalizes and truncates input text. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
