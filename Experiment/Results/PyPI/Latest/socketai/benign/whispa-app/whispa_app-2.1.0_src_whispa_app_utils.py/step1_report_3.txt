{
  "purpose": "The function simplifies text by normalizing whitespace and truncating to a maximum length.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "The return statement outputs the processed text; no external data sinks or network communications.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows into the re.sub operation, then into the return output after processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures detected. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 're' module for regular expressions, defines a function to clean and truncate text, using re.sub to replace multiple whitespace characters with a single space and then trimming leading/trailing spaces. The text is truncated to a maximum length. There are no inputs or outputs that involve external systems, no code injection, data leakage, or malicious logic present. The implementation is straightforward and serves a basic text normalization purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, non-malicious, and performs a standard text cleaning operation. There are no indicators of malware, malicious intent, or security risks.",
