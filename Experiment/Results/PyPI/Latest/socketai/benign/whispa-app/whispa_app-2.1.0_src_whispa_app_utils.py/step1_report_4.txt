{
  "purpose": "The function simplifies a given text by removing excess whitespace and truncating it to a maximum length.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'text' as a string.",
  "sinks": "The returned string after processing; no external sinks are used.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows through the regex substitution and then is truncated before being returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a straightforward whitespace cleanup and truncation with no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 're' module for regular expressions. The 'simplify_text' function takes a string input, replaces multiple whitespace characters with a single space, trims leading and trailing whitespace, and then truncates the result to 'max_len' characters (default 2000). There are no external data sources, no external communication, and no suspicious or malicious code. The logic is simple text processing without any obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs basic text normalization and truncation with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward utility function with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity.",
