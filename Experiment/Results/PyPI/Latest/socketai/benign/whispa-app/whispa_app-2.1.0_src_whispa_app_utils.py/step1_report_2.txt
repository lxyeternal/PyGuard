{
  "purpose": "The function simplifies a given text string by removing excess whitespace and truncating it to a maximum length.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'text' is the source of data, provided externally when the function is called.",
  "sinks": "The code processes the input text but does not write data to external sources or perform any network operations.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is cleaned by replacing multiple whitespace characters with a single space, then truncated to 'max_len'. No external data flows or outputs are generated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is straightforward and standard for text processing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 're' module for regular expression operations. It defines a function to normalize whitespace in a string and truncate it to a specified maximum length. The use of regex for whitespace normalization and string slicing are common, safe operations. No external network, file, or environment interactions are involved. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign text processing utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
