{
  "purpose": "Initialize the Whispa App package and expose main classes/functions for external use",
  "sources": "No data input sources; code imports from local modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external data transmission present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code solely defines package metadata and imports",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains a docstring, version information, and an import statement to expose components of the package. It does not process external input, handle untrusted data, or perform any operations that could be exploited. It adheres to standard package initialization practices and contains no apparent malicious or security-sensitive code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. It appears to serve as a basic module setup without any security concerns.",
