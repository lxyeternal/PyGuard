  "purpose": "Initialize the Whispa App package, providing transcription and translation functionalities via external modules.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static version string; import statement from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no data processing or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code mainly sets up module imports and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py file that sets package metadata, provides a docstring, and imports key classes/functions. It does not include any user input handling, external data processing, or suspicious code constructs. The import statement is standard for exposing API components. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package initialization file with no malicious or security-compromising elements. It serves to expose the main application components and document the package purpose without any suspicious behavior.",
