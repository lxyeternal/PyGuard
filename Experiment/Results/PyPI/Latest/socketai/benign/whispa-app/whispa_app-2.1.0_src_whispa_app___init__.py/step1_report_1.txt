  "purpose": "Initialize the Whispa application package, providing transcription and translation functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module metadata (__version__) and imports classes/functions from a local module (.main).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external data, or sensitive information handling detected.",
  "flows": "The code only imports modules and sets a version; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The script serves as an initialization module, setting a version string and exposing key classes/functions for the application. It contains no input handling, no network operations, no dynamic code execution, and no apparent malicious logic. The import statement is standard and limited to local modules. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign initialization script for the application package. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
