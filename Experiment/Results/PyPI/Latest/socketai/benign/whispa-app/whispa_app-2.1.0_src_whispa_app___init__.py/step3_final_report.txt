  "purpose": "Initialize the Python package by setting version info and exposing main application components.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports from a local module (.main).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets a variable and imports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with a descriptive docstring and simple import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py that defines a version string and imports classes/functions from a local module. It contains no input handling, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. The import from .main is standard for exposing package components. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate it is benign. The reports correctly identify this, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initializer with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and their scores are justified. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
