  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py file that provides package metadata and imports key classes and functions from a local module. It contains a docstring describing the package purpose, a version string, and a simple import statement. There are no indications of code execution, data processing, or external data handling that could pose security risks or malicious intent. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initialization file with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It only exposes components of the package and includes a descriptive docstring. There are no security concerns based on this code snippet.",
