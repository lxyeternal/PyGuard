{
  "purpose": "Preloads various Whisper models and translation models to cache them for faster access.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the hardcoded 'sizes' list and 'MODEL_MAP' imported from modules.",
  "sinks": "Function calls to 'get_whisper_model' and 'translate_text' potentially involve loading large models or performing translations, but no untrusted input is used here.",
  "flows": "The code sequentially calls model loading and translation functions with static parameters, with no external input influencing behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific functions and executes model loading and translation with predefined parameters. It does not process user input or external data streams. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors are present. The logic is straightforward, intended solely for caching models to improve performance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for model preloading, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
