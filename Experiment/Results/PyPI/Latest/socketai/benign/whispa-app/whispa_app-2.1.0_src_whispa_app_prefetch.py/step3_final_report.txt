{
  "purpose": "The code preloads various models and translations to cache them for performance optimization.",
  "sources": "Static data: list of model sizes and MODEL_MAP keys; function calls to get_whisper_model and translate_text.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or data leaks; functions operate on static inputs.",
  "flows": "Static data flows into function calls for model loading and translation; no external data or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward preloading with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple, static preloading of models and translations for caching purposes. It does not process external inputs, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data. The functions invoked are for resource loading, not malicious activity. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or anomalies. The low resource impact and absence of external data or network activity indicate minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for performance caching, with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores should reflect this benign nature.",
