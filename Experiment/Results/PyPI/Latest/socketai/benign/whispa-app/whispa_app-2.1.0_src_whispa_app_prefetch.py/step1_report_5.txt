{
  "purpose": "The code prefetches and caches different Whisper models and translation models for performance optimization.",
  "sources": "Reads no untrusted input; uses hardcoded model sizes and language mappings.",
  "sinks": "Calls functions get_whisper_model and translate_text which may perform model loading and text translation.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded model sizes and language keys are used as parameters for functions that load models and translate text.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present. No hardcoded credentials or secret tokens are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code sequentially preloads speech recognition and translation models using hardcoded parameters. It does not process user input, nor does it perform network communications or system modifications. The functions called may load models into memory but do not exhibit malicious behavior by themselves. The structure is straightforward and intended for caching purposes. No anomalies or suspicious activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple caching routine for models and translations, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be intended for performance optimization without any malicious intent.",
