{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package named 'whispa_app' with its metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; gathers package data from 'src' directory; specifies dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data processed at runtime within this script.",
  "flows": "N/A, as this is a setup script that does not handle runtime data flow or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual or suspicious constructs. The dependencies listed are common packages for AI and GUI development.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports setup tools, reads a README file for the long description, and configures package installation parameters, dependencies, and metadata. The dependencies include AI and GUI libraries, which are standard for the described application. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present. No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign setup configuration for a Python package related to speech transcription and translation. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks within this script.",
