{
  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'whispa_app' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, package data, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md, package metadata definitions, dependencies list, package data paths, entry point declaration.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Static configuration data used during package installation; no runtime data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file, specifies package metadata, dependencies, package data, and entry points. All dependencies are well-known packages, and there are no dynamic code executions, network calls, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code structure is clear, and no hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are present. Multiple reviews confirm the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is appropriately zero, indicating no malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal, consistent with a benign setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All assessments and scores are accurate and justified based on static analysis.",
