{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package named 'whispa_app', used to package and distribute a GUI application for Whisper transcription and MarianMT translation.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, package discovery via find_packages, and dependencies specified in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; dependencies are specified explicitly, and no network or system calls are made in this script.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; the script primarily reads static files and sets up package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic; standard setup script with no obfuscated or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python packaging practices with setuptools. It reads a README file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points, all typical for a setup.py. There are no code injection points, no network operations, and no suspicious behavior detected. All dependencies are explicitly listed and are well-known packages. No anomalies such as hidden backdoors or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely performs package configuration tasks without any suspicious behavior.",
