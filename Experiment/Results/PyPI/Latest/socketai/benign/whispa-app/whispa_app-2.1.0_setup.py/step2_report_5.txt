  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for a Python package.\n- No dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- Dependencies are explicitly listed and well-known.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or runtime data handling is evident.\n- The package data and entry points are typical for such applications.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Specific analysis per report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Package setup for `whispa_app`.  \n- Conclusion: No signs of malicious activity.  \n- Malware score: 0.  \n- Confidence: 1.  \n**Verdict:** Fully consistent, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Define setup configuration.  \n- Conclusion: No suspicious behavior.  \n- Malware score: 0.  \n- Confidence: 1.  \n**Verdict:** Fully consistent, no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Setup configuration with dependencies.  \n- Conclusion: No signs of malicious activity.  \n- Malware score: 0.  \n- Confidence: 1.  \n**Verdict:** Fully consistent, no issues.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Package setup.  \n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior detected.  \n- Malware score: 0.  \n- Confidence: 1.  \n**Verdict:** Fully consistent, no issues.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Package configuration.  \n- Conclusion: No signs of malicious intent.  \n- Malware score: 0.  \n- Confidence: 1.  \n**Verdict:** Fully consistent, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** No, the code is a straightforward setup script.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero, as no malicious activity is indicated.\n- **Obfuscated code:** Zero, all code is clear and standard.\n- **Security risk:** None, no suspicious behaviors, data leaks, or network activities.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are appropriate (all zero).\n- **Risk scores:** Given the absence of any suspicious or malicious indicators, the overall risk scores should remain very low, close to zero.\n\n---\n\n### **My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, just acknowledging the package setup context)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and no modifications are necessary. The package appears to be a legitimate setup script with no security concerns.",
