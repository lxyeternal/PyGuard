  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'whispa_app' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file; importing setup and find_packages from setuptools; defining package data and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data outputs observed; no network or system calls are made.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> package setup with specified dependencies and package data -> defining console script entry point.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script utilizing setuptools. It reads a markdown README file and specifies package metadata, dependencies, package data, and entry points. All dependencies are well-known and standard, with no indication of malicious intent. No suspicious code, obfuscated parts, or hidden behaviors are present. The package data points to assets files, and the entry point points to a main function within the package, typical for CLI tools. There are no external network calls or environment variable manipulations that could indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a legitimate package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It strictly handles package metadata and dependencies without executing any untrusted code or performing suspicious actions.",
