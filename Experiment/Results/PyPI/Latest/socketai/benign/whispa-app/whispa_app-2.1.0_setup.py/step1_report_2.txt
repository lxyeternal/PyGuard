{
  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the 'whispa_app' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current directory to load README.md content; reads package dependencies; retrieves package data files.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or code execution are present.",
  "flows": "The setup process uses static configuration data; no untrusted input flows into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior are observed. All dependencies and data are statically defined. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. It reads a README file for long description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, package data, and entry points. All dependencies are versioned and well-defined. The script uses static configuration without dynamic or obfuscated code. No malicious or suspicious logic is present. No data is read from or written to untrusted sources; no network or system calls indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration file for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs package setup tasks securely and transparently.",
