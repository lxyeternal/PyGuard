{
  "purpose": "Selects and returns the appropriate device ('cuda' or 'cpu') based on GPU availability and VRAM size.",
  "sources": "torch.cuda.is_available(), torch.cuda.get_device_properties()",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is processed or outputted beyond returning a string.",
  "flows": "GPU availability check -> VRAM size check -> return device string",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected. Logging is used for debugging purposes but not for malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for CUDA GPU availability, queries the device's total VRAM, and based on a minimum VRAM threshold, chooses to return 'cuda' or defaults to 'cpu'. It handles exceptions gracefully. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or backdoors. No obfuscation or hidden malicious instructions are present. The code performs a legitimate hardware check relevant to its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward GPU device selection utility with no malicious intent. It is safe, with no indications of malware or security risks.",
