{
  "purpose": "Selects computing device (GPU or CPU) based on GPU availability and VRAM size.",
  "sources": "torch.cuda.is_available(), torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_memory",
  "sinks": "Return statement indicating the device string; logging statements",
  "flows": "Input checks from torch.cuda methods leading to return of 'cuda' or 'cpu'",
  "anomalies": "Use of GPU properties is standard; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation; logging is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for GPU availability and VRAM size to decide whether to use 'cuda' or 'cpu'. It uses standard PyTorch functions and logging for debugging. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. It does not send data externally or perform any covert actions. The code appears straightforward and typical for device selection in ML workflows.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard device selection utility with no indications of malicious behavior. It relies solely on publicly available library functions and performs no harmful actions.",
