{
  "purpose": "The function determines whether to use a CUDA GPU or CPU based on the available VRAM, for optimized computation.",
  "sources": "Reads from torch.cuda.get_device_properties to check GPU properties and total_memory for VRAM size.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data or potential leaks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Sources (GPU properties) are used to decide the return value, no external or untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. Logging is used for debugging but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it checks for CUDA availability, queries GPU memory, and returns 'cuda' if VRAM exceeds a threshold. It handles exceptions gracefully. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious data handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility function for hardware detection with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
