{
  "purpose": "Selects and returns the appropriate device ('cuda' or 'cpu') based on GPU availability and VRAM size.",
  "sources": "Reads GPU device properties via torch.cuda.get_device_properties and checks for CUDA availability using torch.cuda.is_available().",
  "sinks": "Returns a string indicating device type; no data leaks or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "GPU properties are queried and used internally; the output depends on hardware status but does not process untrusted external data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the logic is straightforward for device selection. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for CUDA availability, queries GPU VRAM, logs debug information, and returns 'cuda' if VRAM meets the threshold; otherwise, defaults to 'cpu'. The code includes exception handling for GPU querying. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard device selection process based on hardware capabilities. It contains no malware or malicious intent. The logic is clear, with proper exception handling, and does not pose security risks.",
