{
  "purpose": "The code determines whether to use CUDA or CPU based on GPU availability and VRAM size.",
  "sources": "torch.cuda.is_available(), torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_memory",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks",
  "flows": "Availability check -> VRAM query -> VRAM comparison -> Return device string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward API usage, exception handling in place",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard GPU availability check and VRAM size comparison using well-known PyTorch APIs. It logs VRAM info and handles exceptions gracefully. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The logic is simple and benign, with no network activity or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for device selection, with no security risks or malicious behavior. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
