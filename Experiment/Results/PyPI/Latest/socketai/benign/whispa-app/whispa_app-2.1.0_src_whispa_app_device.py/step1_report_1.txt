  "purpose": "Selects the appropriate computing device (CUDA GPU or CPU) based on available VRAM.",
  "sources": "Reads system GPU properties via torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_memory.",
  "sinks": "Returns a string ('cuda' or 'cpu') indicating the selected device.",
  "flows": "Reads GPU total_memory -> logs debug message -> returns 'cuda' if VRAM >= min_vram_gb, else 'cpu'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and uses standard PyTorch API. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for GPU availability and VRAM size to determine whether to use GPU or CPU. It logs the VRAM and handles exceptions gracefully. No untrusted data sources, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation detected. The logic is typical for device selection routines. No network access, data leaks, or malicious instructions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign device selection utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It operates as intended without introducing security risks.",
