  "purpose": "This code provides functions for loading a Whisper speech-to-text model and transcribing audio files, with support for local and remote model sources, device selection, and progress reporting.",
  "sources": "Reading system environment variables (sys.executable, os.getcwd), checking directory existence (os.path.isdir), accessing model files, and input file paths (filepath argument in transcribe_file).",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs (info and error), raising RuntimeError on failure, returning transcribed text.",
  "flows": "Source data (model size, device info, file path) influences model loading and transcription; logs and errors are generated based on these flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code patterns; no obfuscated code; uses standard libraries and normal control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code loads models from local directories or HF hub, caches models, and performs transcription with progress callback. It handles exceptions gracefully with logs and errors. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. Third-party library usage (faster_whisper) is standard for speech transcription tasks. No malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or privacy violations detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and secure, designed for efficient speech transcription. It properly handles errors, manages resources, and avoids suspicious operations. No malicious intent or security risks are apparent based on this snippet.",
