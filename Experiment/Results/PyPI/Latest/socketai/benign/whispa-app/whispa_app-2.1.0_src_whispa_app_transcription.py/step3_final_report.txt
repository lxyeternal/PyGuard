  "purpose": "Provides functions to load Whisper models from local directories or HF hub and transcribe audio files with progress reporting.",
  "sources": "Filesystem (model directories, audio file), environment (sys, os), user input (filepath, model_size, device), external callback (progress_callback).",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs, model loading, progress_callback (receives progress info), exception raising.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> get_whisper_model (load/cache model) -> transcribe_file (transcribe audio, report progress) -> progress_callback invoked with progress data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads models from local or remote sources, caches models, transcribes audio files, and reports progress. It handles errors gracefully. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are present. External dependencies are standard, and data flows are straightforward. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-implemented speech transcription utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action is necessary.",
