  "purpose": "A GUI application for audio transcription and translation, allowing users to select files, choose models and languages, and view/save results.",
  "sources": "User input fields (file path, model, language), external functions (`transcribe_file`, `translate`), system info queries (psutil, torch).",
  "sinks": "File save dialogs, GUI text boxes for transcription and translation output, progress bars, labels, and system info display.",
  "flows": "User inputs file path -> transcribe button triggers background thread -> external `transcribe_file` processes data -> output inserted into GUI text box; similarly for translation with `translate`.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured GUI app utilizing standard libraries and external modules for transcription and translation. It handles user input, threading, and resource management appropriately. No malicious or suspicious behaviors such as network exfiltration, credential theft, or obfuscation are present. External functions are assumed legitimate. The resource handling and threading are correctly implemented. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2), consistent with benign, typical application behavior. No anomalies or signs of sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured GUI application for audio transcription and translation, with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
