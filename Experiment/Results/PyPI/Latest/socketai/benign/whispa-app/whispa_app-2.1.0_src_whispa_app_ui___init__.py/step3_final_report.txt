{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports and re-exports UI component builder functions for the Whispa App, facilitating easy access to these components.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports functions from local modules (.header, .file_input, .panels).",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process or output data beyond module exports.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing functions from local modules and exposing them via __all__, with no data or control flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports three functions from local modules and exposes them through __all__. It contains no user input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No logical flaws or security concerns are identified. The code functions solely as an interface for UI components, with no external dependencies or data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module for exposing UI component functions with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
