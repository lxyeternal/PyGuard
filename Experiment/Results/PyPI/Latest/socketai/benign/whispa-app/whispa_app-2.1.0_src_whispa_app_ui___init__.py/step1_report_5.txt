  "purpose": "This code defines and exports UI component builder functions for the Whispa App, facilitating easy imports.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs within this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from source to sink, as the code solely imports and exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward module re-exporting; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three functions from sibling modules and defines __all__ for export. It contains no logic, data handling, user input, or network activity. It serves purely as an interface aggregator. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The simplicity reduces the likelihood of hidden malicious code or supply chain attacks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for exporting UI component builders with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger application.",
