  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .header, .file_input, .panels",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks, no untrusted data handling, no external network calls",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; only module exports",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code only imports functions from local modules and exposes them via __all__ for easy import. There are no signs of malicious behavior, external network access, data leakage, or obfuscated code. It appears to be standard module export code for UI components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward module export code with no malicious or security risks detected.",
