  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward module that imports three functions from local modules and exposes them via `__all__`. It contains no user input handling, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as a simple interface module.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - The code is purely an interface with no data handling, no external calls, and no suspicious patterns.\n   - Therefore, higher risk scores are unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing untrusted code, network calls, or data exfiltration.\n   - Malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and based on the actual static analysis.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made; the analysis is consistent with the code.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a benign, standard module that re-exports UI component builder functions. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious code, and has no obfuscation or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score |\n|------------------|--------------|\n| Malware          | 0            |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            |\n| Security Risk    | 0            |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
