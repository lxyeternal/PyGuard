  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module that imports three functions from local modules and re-exports them via `__all__`. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, user input handling, or data processing.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior or Malware:**  \n   Every report explicitly states that there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or malware. The code is purely an interface for UI component functions.\n\n3. **Security Risks and Vulnerabilities:**  \n   Given the simplicity and static nature of the code, there are no apparent security risks, data leaks, or external dependencies that could be exploited.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.  \n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis.  \n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, justified by the lack of any suspicious or risky behavior.\n\n5. **Potential Flaws or Mistakes:**  \n   No logical errors, security flaws, or suspicious patterns are identified. The code is minimal and standard for a module interface.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly concluding that this is benign, standard code with no security concerns.\n- Given the simplicity, there's no need to assign any higher risk scores or suspect malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a benign, straightforward module for exposing UI component functions, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
