  "purpose": "This code serves as a module to expose UI component builder functions for the Whispa App, facilitating easy imports of header, file input, and panels UI elements.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from relative modules: .header, .file_input, and .panels.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks related to untrusted data processing or output; the code does not handle input or output directly.",
  "flows": "The module imports functions and then re-exports them in __all__, with no data processing or flow from input to output within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors. The code appears straightforward, focused on module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three functions from local modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use, serving as a UI component registry. No user input handling, data processing, or network activity is present. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module to re-export UI builder functions. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
