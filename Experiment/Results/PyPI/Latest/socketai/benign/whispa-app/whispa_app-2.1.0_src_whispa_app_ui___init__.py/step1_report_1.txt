{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an interface module that exposes UI component builder functions for the Whispa App, facilitating easier imports.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module imports and the special variable __all__.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable; the code only imports functions and sets an attribute.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no unusual code patterns, dynamic execution, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports three functions from local modules, which are intended for building UI components. It then defines __all__ to specify exported functions. There is no user input, no environment variable usage, and no dynamic code execution. The code appears to be a standard module interface setup, with no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module interface for UI components with no malicious or security concerns detected. It does not contain suspicious behavior or malware, serving solely to organize and expose functions for the app.",
