  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Verification:**  \n   The original code is a straightforward Python module that imports three functions (`build_header`, `build_file_input`, `build_panels`) from local modules and exposes them via the `__all__` variable. There are no data flows, user inputs, or outputs. The code is purely for organizing exports of UI components.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is simple, standard, and free of suspicious patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code only performs module imports and re-exports, with no data handling or malicious intent. No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.  \n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of security concerns.\n\n   These scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n5. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**  \n   Since the code is purely an interface module with no data processing, no external calls, and no user input, there's no justification for any risk scores above 0.5. The code does not pose any security threat.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they logically conclude that the code is benign based on its structure.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and with the code's actual behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code appears to be a benign, standard module for exposing UI components, with no malicious or security concerns.**",
