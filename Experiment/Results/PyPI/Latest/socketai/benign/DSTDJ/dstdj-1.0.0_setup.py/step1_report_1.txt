  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Python project 'DSTDJ', defining metadata and package information.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, description, and long description from files 'README.txt' and 'CHANGELOG.txt'.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is processed or used in a way that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads ('README.txt', 'CHANGELOG.txt') into the long_description parameter; no other data flows indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of 'open' to read files is standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata and uses standard setup procedures. No suspicious behavior or malicious code is present. No network activity, code execution, or external calls that could indicate malicious intent. The code structure is typical for a Python setup script and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
