  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .sbmp import *\n```\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code performs a relative import from a local module `sbmp`.\n- The import uses a wildcard `*`, which can obscure what symbols are imported.\n- The snippet itself is minimal, with no direct execution, data flow, or external interaction.\n- The security concern mainly hinges on the content of `sbmp`, which is unknown here.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n\n**Does the code match the reports?**  \nYes, all reports correctly identify the import statement and the use of `*`. No additional code or context is provided, so no malicious activity can be directly confirmed or denied from this snippet alone.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n\n- **All reports** correctly note that wildcard imports are discouraged and can hide malicious code, but they do not provide evidence that `sbmp` is malicious.\n- **No report** claims direct malicious behavior or active exploits, which is accurate given the minimal code.\n\n**No significant logical errors or flaws** are apparent in the reports. They appropriately emphasize the risks associated with wildcard imports and the lack of context.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- **Confidence scores** vary from 0.4 to 0.9, which is reasonable given the minimal context.\n- **Malware scores** are all zero, which aligns with the absence of evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Security risks** are low (around 0.2-0.3), which is appropriate for a simple import statement.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \nGiven the lack of evidence, the scores seem reasonable. However, since the wildcard import can be suspicious if `sbmp` is malicious, a **malware score of 0** remains appropriate unless additional context suggests otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- The reports assign a maximum of 0.6 confidence, but the malware score remains at 0, which is correct because there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- The overall security risk is low, reflecting the minimal code.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The use of relative import (`from .sbmp import *`) is common in packages but can be risky if the package or module is compromised.\n- Without inspecting `sbmp`, we cannot determine if it contains malicious code or not.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n\n- The reports assume that wildcard imports could hide malicious code, which is valid. But **without evidence**, this remains a theoretical concern.\n- The assumption that `sbmp` could be malicious is not supported by any evidence here.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: low malware, low security risk, moderate confidence based on the import pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on all reports and the code snippet:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2–0.3 (low, mainly due to wildcard import concerns)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a simple relative import with a wildcard, which can be risky if the imported module is malicious. However, there is no evidence here to suggest malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and the overall security posture based on this snippet is low.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nTo thoroughly assess the security risk, inspecting the contents of `sbmp` would be necessary. Without that, the current evaluation remains conservative and justified.",
