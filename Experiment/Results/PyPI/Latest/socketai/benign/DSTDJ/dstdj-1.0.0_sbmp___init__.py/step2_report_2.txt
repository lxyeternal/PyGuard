  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims, and assess the scores:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports are about the same minimal code snippet: `from .sbmp import *`.  \nThis code is straightforward: a relative import with a wildcard. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation directly visible here. The content of `sbmp` is unknown, which is a key factor.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports correctly identify the use of wildcard imports as a potential security concern, mainly because it can hide what symbols are imported.  \n- They acknowledge that the code itself does not perform malicious actions but warn about the potential risk if `sbmp` is malicious.  \n- The assessments seem consistent; no report claims direct malicious activity from this snippet alone.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- **Confidence**: Ranges from 0.4 to 0.9, which seems reasonable given the minimal code.  \n- **Obfuscated**: All zero, which aligns with the straightforward code.  \n- **Malware**: All zero, which is appropriate unless evidence suggests malicious content in `sbmp`.  \n- **Security Risk**: Slightly above zero (0.2-0.3), reflecting cautious concern about wildcard import and potential malicious `sbmp`.  \n- These scores seem reasonable, given the limited context.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**  \nNone of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which is appropriate because the code is just an import statement, and no malicious activity is demonstrated.  \nIf the content of `sbmp` were known to be malicious, the risk would be higher, but based solely on this snippet, the risk remains low.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations**  \n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified given no evidence of malicious behavior.  \n- If `sbmp` were malicious, the malware score should be increased, but this cannot be inferred from the import statement alone.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions and Consistency**  \n- The assumption that wildcard import can hide malicious code is valid but does not imply maliciousness by itself.  \n- The reports do not overstate the threat; they correctly state that the risk depends on the content of `sbmp`.  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**  \n- The code snippet itself is benign but potentially risky if `sbmp` is malicious.  \n- The reports correctly highlight the concern with wildcard imports without overclaiming malicious intent.  \n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, due to potential concern over `sbmp`) but could be slightly higher if context suggests untrusted code.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe overall security posture based on this snippet alone is low risk, but vigilance is warranted if `sbmp` is from an untrusted source. The import pattern itself is common but discouraged in security-sensitive contexts.",
