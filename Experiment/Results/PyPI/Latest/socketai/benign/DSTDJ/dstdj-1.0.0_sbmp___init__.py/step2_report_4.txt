  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports describe a single line import statement: `from .sbmp import *`.\n- They agree that this is a minimal, straightforward import from a local module.\n- The primary concern is the use of wildcard import (`*`), which can obscure what symbols are imported and potentially hide malicious or unwanted code.\n- No direct malicious actions, data leaks, or suspicious sinks are identified in the snippets.\n- Confidence levels vary from 0.4 to 0.9, with most around 0.6, indicating moderate certainty about potential concerns.\n- Malware scores are uniformly 0, indicating no direct evidence of malicious code.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.2 to 0.3), reflecting some caution but not high threat levels.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code snippet itself is just an import statement; it does not contain any malicious logic or data flow.\n- The use of `from .sbmp import *` can be risky if the module `sbmp` is malicious or compromised, but the snippet alone does not demonstrate malicious behavior.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports assume that wildcard imports are suspicious or potentially malicious. While this is a valid concern, it is not inherently malicious; it is more about code clarity and maintainability.\n- No evidence is provided that `sbmp` contains malicious code; the concern is speculative based on the import pattern.\n- The reports correctly note that further analysis of the `sbmp` module is necessary to determine actual risk.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, which aligns with the lack of evidence of malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting the minimal nature of the code snippet.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate given the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- Since no malicious code or behavior is demonstrated, the overall malware score should remain at 0.\n- The security risk score could be slightly higher if the `sbmp` module is untrusted, but based solely on this snippet, a low score (around 0.2) seems appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are moderate, given the minimal code and lack of context.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, due to wildcard import concerns but no direct threat)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The primary concern is the potential for the `sbmp` module to contain malicious code, which cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.\n- The use of wildcard import is discouraged but not inherently malicious; it warrants further review of the `sbmp` module itself.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the provided code and reports, the security risk is minimal. The main concern is the use of wildcard import, which should prompt further inspection of the `sbmp` module for malicious content. However, the code snippet itself does not demonstrate malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Recommended Scores:**  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0**  \n- Risk: **0.2**",
