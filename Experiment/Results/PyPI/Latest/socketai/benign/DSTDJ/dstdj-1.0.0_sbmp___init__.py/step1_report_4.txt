{
  "purpose": "The code imports everything from the 'sbmp' module, likely to utilize its functionalities within the current package.",
  "sources": "The import statement is the primary source, which loads code from the 'sbmp' module.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be within the 'sbmp' module itself, but this cannot be determined from the import statement alone.",
  "flows": "Data or control flow depends on how the imported module's functions or classes are used later, which is not shown here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not display any unusual or suspicious patterns by itself. The use of relative import is typical in packages.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement using a relative import syntax. No other code is present. Since the import is from a local module and not directly executing untrusted data or commands, there are no apparent security issues. Without additional context or usage, it cannot be determined whether 'sbmp' contains malicious code. The minimal nature of this snippet makes it unlikely to be malicious by itself.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard, importing from a local module. Further analysis of the 'sbmp' module is necessary to fully evaluate security implications.",
