  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .sbmp import *\n```\n\n**Overall Context:**  \nThis is a minimal import statement that pulls all symbols from a local module named 'sbmp'. The security implications depend heavily on the content of 'sbmp' and how the imported symbols are used later.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code itself is straightforward and syntactically correct.\n- The use of a wildcard import (`*`) from a local module is unconventional and can be risky because it obscures what symbols are imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code.\n\n**No direct malicious behavior** is observable from this snippet alone, but the pattern warrants caution.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n\n- **Consensus on the wildcard import concern:** All reports correctly identify the use of `*` as a potential security concern, as it can hide malicious functions or variables if 'sbmp' is malicious.\n- **Lack of context:** All reports acknowledge that without inspecting 'sbmp', it's impossible to determine malicious intent.\n- **No mention of static analysis or further inspection of 'sbmp':** Since the content of 'sbmp' is unknown, no definitive malicious activity can be confirmed.\n\n**Overall, the reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.**\n\n---\n\n### Score Review and Justifications:\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Security Risk | Comments |\n|----------|------------------|----------------|----------|\n| 1 | 0 | 0.3 | Correctly low; no direct malicious activity. |\n| 2 | 0 | 0.3 | Same reasoning; no immediate threat. |\n| 3 | 0 | 0 | No malicious signs, just an import. |\n| 4 | 0 | 0.2 | Slightly lower risk, as no anomalies or suspicion. |\n| 5 | 0 | 0.2 | Consistent with others; minimal risk. |\n\n**The malware scores are all zero, which is reasonable given the minimal code.**  \n**Security risk scores are slightly above zero, reflecting potential concern due to wildcard import but not indicating active malicious behavior.**\n\n---\n\n### Challenging Assumptions and Claims:\n\n- The reports assume that 'sbmp' could be malicious due to the wildcard import. This is valid but unprovable without inspecting 'sbmp'.\n- No reports suggest that 'sbmp' is known to be malicious or that the import is malicious in itself.\n- The risk scores could be slightly higher if 'sbmp' is from an untrusted source, but with the given information, the current scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency and Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- Since all reports agree on the low risk, no adjustments are necessary.\n- The primary concern is the use of wildcard import, which should be flagged in security reviews, especially if 'sbmp' is untrusted.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2–0.3 (low, due to wildcard import concerns)\n\n---\n\n### My Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — mainly due to the wildcard import pattern, which can hide malicious code if 'sbmp' is compromised.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis import statement alone is not malicious but should prompt further review of the 'sbmp' module. The use of wildcard import is discouraged and can be exploited if 'sbmp' contains malicious code. The current scores are appropriate given the minimal code snippet.",
