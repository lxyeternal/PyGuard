{
  "purpose": "The code imports everything from a local module named 'sbmp'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module 'sbmp'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "Import potentially exposes symbols or code from 'sbmp', but no direct data flow or execution flow is visible.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a relative import with a wildcard (*) is uncommon and can hide what is being imported. This can be risky if 'sbmp' contains malicious code or unexpected symbols.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, only performing a relative import from 'sbmp'. The use of '*' may introduce all symbols from 'sbmp', which can be suspicious if 'sbmp' is malicious or contains hidden code. No further context is provided. Since this is just an import statement, it does not directly perform malicious actions but could be part of a larger malicious package. The code itself is straightforward, but the risk depends on the content of 'sbmp'.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet alone does not demonstrate malicious behavior but has potential security concerns due to the use of a wildcard import. The overall security risk is low but warrants review of 'sbmp' for malicious or unwanted content.",
