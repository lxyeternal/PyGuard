{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the module '.sbmp', likely part of a package or subpackage.",
  "sources": "The import statement is the only source, which does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external data flow is evident.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows or untrusted data from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a wildcard import ('from .sbmp import *'), which can obscure the actual imported symbols and potentially hide malicious or unwanted code. This pattern is often discouraged, but by itself, it is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single line import statement importing everything from a relative module '.sbmp'. Without additional context or code, there are no direct signs of malicious behavior such as data leaks, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The use of wildcard import can be suspicious if the imported module is malicious or untrusted, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious intent. There are no input sources or suspicious sinks identified, and no evident data flow. Overall, the snippet is minimal and does not demonstrate malicious activity but warrants caution if the module '.sbmp' is untrusted or contains malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code alone does not show malicious behavior. It is a simple import statement with potential concerns regarding the use of wildcard import, but no clear malicious activity is present based solely on this fragment.",
