{
  "purpose": "This code performs a relative import from a local module 'sbmp' using a wildcard, which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no other data sources are evident in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if 'sbmp' contains malicious code, the imported symbols could perform harmful actions when used elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The import brings all symbols from 'sbmp' into the current namespace; subsequent use of these symbols could lead to malicious behavior if 'sbmp' is compromised.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import 'from .sbmp import *' is unconventional and can hide malicious or unintended code; no direct malicious activity is observable in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal relative import with a wildcard, which is generally discouraged due to obscurity. The security implications depend entirely on the content of 'sbmp', which is unknown. The import pattern itself does not demonstrate malicious behavior but warrants caution. Scores assigned in the reports (malware score 0, low security risk) are appropriate given the lack of evidence. The main concern is trusting the 'sbmp' module; without inspecting it, the risk remains theoretical. The code does not contain obfuscation or active malicious actions. Overall, the risk is low but should be reviewed if 'sbmp' is from an untrusted source.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a simple, potentially risky import statement due to the wildcard usage. No malicious activity is demonstrated here, but the use of 'import *' warrants caution. The current scores are justified; further inspection of 'sbmp' is recommended to confirm safety.",
