  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in the provided code snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows observable in this single line of import statement",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('*') which can obscure the source of imported functions or variables and potentially include malicious or unintended code",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement that pulls all definitions from a local module 'sbmp'. This practice can hide malicious or harmful functions or variables if they exist within 'sbmp', but by itself, it is a common and legitimate Python statement. There is no evidence of malicious behavior in this minimal snippet. The lack of additional context makes it impossible to determine if 'sbmp' contains malicious code. The use of wildcard imports is generally discouraged as it hampers code clarity and can unintentionally introduce security issues if 'sbmp' is compromised or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a simple import statement with no immediate malicious indicators. However, the use of wildcard import could conceal malicious or unintended code in 'sbmp'. Without further context or code, the security risk appears low but not negligible if 'sbmp' is compromised or malicious.",
