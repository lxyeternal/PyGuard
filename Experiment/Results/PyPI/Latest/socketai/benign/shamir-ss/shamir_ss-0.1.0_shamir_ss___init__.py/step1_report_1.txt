{
  "purpose": "This code module imports specific functions from a local module named 'shamir' for secret sharing operations and exposes them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.shamir' module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no input/output operations or external connections present",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; the code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions, generate_shares and reconstruct_secret, from a local module 'shamir'. It then defines __all__ to control exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The simplicity and clarity suggest this is a standard, safe module setup. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import and export setup for secret sharing functions, with no indication of malicious intent or security issues.",
