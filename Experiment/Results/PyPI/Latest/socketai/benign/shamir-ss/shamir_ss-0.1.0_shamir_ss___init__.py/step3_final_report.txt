  "purpose": "A minimal module that imports cryptographic functions from a local 'shamir' module and exposes them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from '.shamir' module",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, network, or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "Import of functions from '.shamir' to module exports via __all__",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export, no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple re-export module that imports two functions, 'generate_shares' and 'reconstruct_secret', from a local module. It defines __all__ to specify exported functions. No data flow, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is minimal, clear, and free of anomalies or malicious patterns. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as an API interface for cryptographic functions. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
