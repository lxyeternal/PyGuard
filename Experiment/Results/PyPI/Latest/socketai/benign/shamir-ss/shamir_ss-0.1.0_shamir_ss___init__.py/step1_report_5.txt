{
  "purpose": "The code re-exports functions 'generate_shares' and 'reconstruct_secret' from the local 'shamir' module, indicating a purpose related to secret sharing or cryptography.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from a local module 'shamir'. No input reading or external data sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or sensitive data leaks observed in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only defines exports without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for module exports. No unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports specific functions from a local module and defines an export list. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. It appears to be part of a cryptography-related library, possibly implementing secret sharing schemes. No external inputs, sensitive data, or insecure operations are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves as a straightforward module export with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
