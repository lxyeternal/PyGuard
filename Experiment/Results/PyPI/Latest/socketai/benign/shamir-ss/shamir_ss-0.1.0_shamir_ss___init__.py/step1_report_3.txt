{
  "purpose": "This code defines an API for sharing and reconstructing secrets using functions imported from a module named 'shamir'.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from a local module 'shamir'. No external data input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform operations that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations is present; the code merely re-exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with straightforward import and export statements. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions, 'generate_shares' and 'reconstruct_secret', from a local module 'shamir'. It then sets the '__all__' list to expose these functions for external use. The code is clean, simple, and typical for a module's __init__.py or API interface. No malicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are identified. There are no dynamic code executions, external network interactions, or other risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module that re-exports functions related to secret sharing. It shows no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attack, or security risks. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
