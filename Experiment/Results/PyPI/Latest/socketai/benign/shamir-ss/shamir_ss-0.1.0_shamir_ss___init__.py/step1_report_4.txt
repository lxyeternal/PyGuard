  "purpose": "This module re-exports functions 'generate_shares' and 'reconstruct_secret' from the 'shamir' submodule, likely for threshold secret sharing operations.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from '.shamir', indicating reading of the 'shamir' submodule's functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or external communications present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs import and export declarations without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local module and defines an __all__ list for public API exposure. There is no data input, output, or external interaction. No suspicious or malicious code, data leakage, or obfuscation detected. The code appears to be a simple module interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, standard Python module that re-exports functions from a submodule. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears benign and intended for normal use.",
