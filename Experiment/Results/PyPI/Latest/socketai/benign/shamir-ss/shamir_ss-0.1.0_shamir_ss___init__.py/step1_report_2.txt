  "purpose": "The code re-exports functions generate_shares and reconstruct_secret from the .shamir module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .shamir module, indicating dependency on local module code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed as the code only imports and exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; simple import and export statements. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that exposes specific functions from a submodule. No data inputs, external network calls, or risky operations are present. It appears to serve as an API surface for other modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard module re-exporting without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
