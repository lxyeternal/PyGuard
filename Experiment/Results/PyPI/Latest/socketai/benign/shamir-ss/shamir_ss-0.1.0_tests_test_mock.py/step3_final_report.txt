  "purpose": "A trivial test function asserting True, serving as a placeholder or unit test.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; no input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external outputs or network interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code contains only a simple assertion.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, minimal, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function 'test_mock' that asserts True. It performs no external data handling, network activity, or complex logic. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, minimal test stub with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and consistent, and no modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
