{
  "purpose": "A simple test function intended to verify that assertions work correctly, likely used for unit testing.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; no external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; trivial control flow with an assertion.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function 'test_mock' which asserts True. It is a minimal, benign test stub with no external dependencies, no data inputs, or outputs. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The code appears to serve as a simple unit test placeholder or example.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, straightforward, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a basic test function with no indication of malicious intent.",
