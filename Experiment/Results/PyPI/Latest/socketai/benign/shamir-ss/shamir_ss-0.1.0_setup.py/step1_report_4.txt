  "purpose": "This code is for setting up the build process of a Cython extension module named 'shamir_ss.shamir'.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'setuptools' and 'Cython.Build'; the list 'extensions' defining the module and its source file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data or untrusted input is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; setup process is static.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for compiling Cython extensions, defines an extension module with optimization flags, and configures the build with specific compiler directives. No dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious behavior is present. The code solely specifies build parameters for compiling a Cython module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for building a Cython extension. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies identified. It appears safe and solely focused on module compilation.",
