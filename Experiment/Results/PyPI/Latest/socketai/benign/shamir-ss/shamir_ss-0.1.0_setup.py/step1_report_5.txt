  "purpose": "Setup configuration for compiling a Cython extension module named 'shamir_ss.shamir'.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data for extensions and compiler directives; it does not read external inputs or untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not write or execute untrusted data or external commands.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists; the code is purely configuration for building extensions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of Cython for extension compilation is standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup functions from setuptools and Cython, defines an extension module for compilation from a Cython source file, and configures compilation directives. There are no dynamic code execution, input handling, network activity, or malicious patterns. All operations are related to building a Python extension module. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for building a Cython extension and contains no malicious intent or security risks.",
