  "purpose": "Setup script to build and compile a Cython extension module for 'shamir_ss.shamir'.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools and Cython, and the 'shamir.pyx' Cython source file.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present in this build script.",
  "flows": "Imports lead to extension compilation setup; no data flow from sources to sinks involved in malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscation detected. The code appears to be standard setup for Cython compilation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for building a Cython extension, defines an extension module with optimization flags, and calls setup with cythonize. No user input handling, network activity, or sensitive data processing present. The source file is a .pyx Cython file, which is typical for compiling Python extensions. The setup configurations specify compile options and compiler directives but do not include any suspicious or malicious code or behavior. Overall, this is a standard setup script for a Cython extension with no indicators of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build setup for a Cython extension module with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
