  "purpose": "Build configuration script for compiling a Cython extension module named 'shamir_ss.shamir'.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools and Cython.Build, definition of Extension with source 'shamir_ss/shamir.pyx', and setup() invocation.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only sets up build parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for building a Cython extension, involving no network activity, data processing, or dynamic execution. It specifies compilation flags for optimization and does not handle any untrusted input. All reports correctly identify its benign nature and assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. No anomalies or malicious behavior are present or suggested. The source file 'shamir.pyx' is not reviewed here but is typical for such extensions. The code's purpose is solely build configuration, with no evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a safe, standard build configuration with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are justified and should remain at zero. The code poses no threat and is appropriate for use in a supply chain context.",
