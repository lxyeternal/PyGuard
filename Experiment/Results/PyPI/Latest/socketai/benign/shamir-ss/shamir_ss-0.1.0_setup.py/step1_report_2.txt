{
  "purpose": "Configure and build a Cython extension module for the 'shamir_ss.shamir' package.",
  "sources": "Reading input from the setup script, specifically the 'shamir.pyx' Cython source file.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data handling or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The setup process compiles the Cython source into a native extension, with no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The script primarily handles extension configuration and compilation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and Extension from setuptools and Cython.Build. It defines a list of extensions to compile, specifying the module name and source file. It sets compilation arguments for optimization. The setup function then invokes cythonize to prepare the extension with specified directives, such as language level and performance optimizations. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or data leaks. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard extension build practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for building a Cython extension module. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. It appears safe and typical for Python extension compilation.",
