  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a standard setup script for building a Cython extension module named 'shamir_ss.shamir'.\n- The code involves importing setup and Extension from setuptools, Cython.Build's cythonize, defining an extension with compile flags, and invoking setup.\n- No input/output handling, network activity, or dynamic execution is present.\n- The source file is 'shamir_ss/shamir.pyx', which is a Cython source file, typical for extension modules.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are mentioned or detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, indicating no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Confirming issues:**\n- The code is a standard build setup; no issues are present in the code itself.\n- The reports' conclusions about the absence of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or anomalies are consistent with the code.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1.0, which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0, which is justified.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- Since the code is solely a build script, it doesn't process untrusted data or perform network operations.\n- No indication of supply chain attack vectors or malicious behavior.\n- The only possible concern could be if the 'shamir.pyx' source file contains malicious code, but that is outside the scope of this setup script review.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- No changes to scores are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final note:**\n- Since the setup script is standard and no suspicious behavior is detected, the overall security posture appears safe.\n- The focus should be on the contents of 'shamir.pyx' if further analysis is needed for malicious code, but based on the setup script alone, there are no issues.",
