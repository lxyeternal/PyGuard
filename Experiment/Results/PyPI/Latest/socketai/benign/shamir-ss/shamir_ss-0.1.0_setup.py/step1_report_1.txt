  "purpose": "This code configures the build setup for a Cython extension module named 'shamir_ss.shamir' using setuptools and Cython.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'shamir_ss/shamir.pyx' Cython source file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external data or network interactions occur.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only processes build configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present. The setup script appears standard for building a Cython extension.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary build tools, defines a Cython extension with optimization flags, and calls setup with cythonize for compilation. No suspicious code, external data handling, or obfuscated logic detected. It strictly manages build configuration for compiling a Cython module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build setup script for a Cython extension with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
