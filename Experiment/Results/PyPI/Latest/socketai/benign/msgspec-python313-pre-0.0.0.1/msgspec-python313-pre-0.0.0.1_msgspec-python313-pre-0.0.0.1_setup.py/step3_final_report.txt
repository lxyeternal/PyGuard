  "purpose": "A minimal placeholder package setup script using setuptools with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Static string literals defining package name, version, author, email, description, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, user input, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "None; static data used solely for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with static metadata, explicitly described as a placeholder. It contains no dynamic elements, external data handling, or malicious code. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and the explicit description support a benign assessment. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected, and the scores are consistent with the code's static, placeholder purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The package is a benign, static placeholder with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and overall risk are appropriate and accurate.",
