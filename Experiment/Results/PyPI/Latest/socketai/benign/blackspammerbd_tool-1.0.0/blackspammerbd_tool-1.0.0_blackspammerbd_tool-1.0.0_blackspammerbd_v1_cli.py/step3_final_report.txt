  "purpose": "CLI utility for generating, verifying connection codes, listing directory contents, and encoding/decoding files in Base64.",
  "sources": "User input for commands and parameters, reading/writing 'connection_code.txt', reading files for encoding/decoding.",
  "sinks": "File system operations (reading/writing files), console output; no external network communication.",
  "flows": "Input commands trigger functions that read user input or files, process data, and output results or write files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'random.randint' for code generation, which is insecure for cryptographic purposes but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward CLI commands for local file management and code verification. It uses standard libraries with no network activity or external communication. The only security concern is the use of non-cryptographic randomness for code generation, which could be predictable but does not imply malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The functions operate as intended, with proper error handling for file operations. Overall, the code is benign, with minimal security risk related to the predictability of generated codes.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the insecure randomness for code generation, which is a minor flaw. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the minor security concern but no active threats.",
