  "flows": [
    "start_command() generates a random numeric code, displays it, and writes it to 'connection_code.txt'.",
    "connect_command() reads 'connection_code.txt' and compares it with user input.",
    "list_command() lists directory contents.",
    "download_command() reads a specified file, encodes its content in Base64, and writes to a new file with '.b64' extension.",
    "upload_command() reads a Base64-encoded file, decodes it, and writes the binary output to 'uploaded_' + filename."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of random.randint() for code generation without cryptographic security; potential for predictable codes.",
    "No hardcoded secrets or credentials observed.",
    "No evidence of malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, or command execution.",
    "No obfuscated code, misleading variables, or dynamic execution detected.",
    "The script performs straightforward file operations and Base64 transformations."
  ],
  "analysis": "The script provides a set of CLI commands for generating a numeric connection code, verifying it, listing directory contents, and encoding/decoding files in Base64. The code uses standard libraries and simple logic. No network activity, credential theft, or system manipulation is present. The code does not contain any hidden backdoors, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The use of random for code generation is not cryptographically secure but does not constitute malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility focused on file encoding and simple code verification, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
