  "purpose": "A CLI tool for generating, verifying connection codes, listing files, and encoding/decoding files using Base64.",
  "sources": "Input data from command-line arguments and filesystem reads (connection_code.txt, target files).",
  "sinks": "File writing (connection_code.txt, encoded/decoded files), terminal output, potentially sensitive data via base64 encoding.",
  "flows": "Command-line input → file operations (read/write) → terminal output; no network activity or external data transmission observed.",
  "anomalies": "Uses random.randint for code generation without cryptographic security; no hardcoded credentials; straightforward Base64 encoding/decoding; no obfuscation or suspicious imports beyond standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic file and code management functions with clear and standard implementation. It generates a numeric code for connection verification, lists directory contents, and encodes/decodes files in Base64. No input is directly used for system commands beyond file operations; no external network connections or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of random.randint for code generation is insecure for cryptographic purposes but not malicious. The code does not contain any backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious external communications. The overall structure appears legitimate and aligned with standard CLI utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a straightforward CLI tool for managing connection codes and encoding files. No malicious or sabotage behaviors are evident. The only minor security concern is the use of non-cryptographically secure random number generation for connection codes, but this does not indicate malicious intent.",
