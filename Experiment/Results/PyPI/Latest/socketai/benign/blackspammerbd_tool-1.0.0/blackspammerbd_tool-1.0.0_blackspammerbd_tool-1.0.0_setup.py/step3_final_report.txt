  "purpose": "Define package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point for installation and execution.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters such as 'packages', 'entry_points', 'install_requires', 'author', 'url', etc.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'blackspammerbd_tool.cli:main' via CLI command 'bsb', which could run arbitrary code if malicious.",
  "flows": "User invokes 'bsb' command -> triggers 'blackspammerbd_tool.cli:main' -> executes code in 'cli.py' (not provided).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets present in setup script. The 'entry_points' depend on external 'cli.py'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration with no malicious or obfuscated code. The 'entry_points' specify a CLI command that calls a function in 'cli.py'. Without the implementation of 'cli.py', no malicious activity can be confirmed. The dependencies are common packages. The setup script itself is benign. The only potential risk is if 'cli.py' contains malicious code, but this cannot be assessed here. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (0.2) due to potential execution of external code. The confidence in benignity is high (0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The potential risk depends on the implementation of 'cli.py', which is not available. The scores are consistent with the evidence, with a very low security risk score to account for the possible execution of external code.",
