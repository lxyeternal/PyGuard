  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python CLI package 'blackspammerbd_tool' for device connection and file transfer",
  "sources": "find_packages(), setup() parameters, and import statements",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; setup configuration does not execute untrusted code",
  "flows": "No evident data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily package configuration",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed; no obfuscated code or unusual runtime behaviors",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project, including package discovery, metadata, and entry point configuration. It does not contain code execution, network activity, or data handling that could be malicious. All dependencies are typical and declared explicitly. No signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code adheres to standard packaging practices without suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical package configuration file with no harmful behavior.",
