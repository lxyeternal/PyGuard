  "purpose": "A Flask server providing file listing, upload, download, and connection validation endpoints, with minimal validation and access control.",
  "sources": "request.get_json() for input data, os.listdir('.') for listing files, open() for reading files, base64 decoding for uploads.",
  "sinks": "file system operations (list, read, write) based on client input, potential for directory traversal due to lack of sanitization.",
  "flows": "Client sends data to endpoints; server processes input directly into filesystem operations without validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code; no validation or sanitization of filenames, exposing filesystem operations openly.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Flask application exposing filesystem operations without validation or access control. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main security concern is misuse if exposed publicly, such as directory traversal or data leakage, due to unsanitized filenames and lack of authentication. The server's functionality is benign but dangerous in deployment without proper safeguards.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malware or obfuscation. It is a simple file server with significant security risks if exposed publicly, primarily due to lack of validation and access control. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be approximately 0.7 to reflect the potential for misuse.",
