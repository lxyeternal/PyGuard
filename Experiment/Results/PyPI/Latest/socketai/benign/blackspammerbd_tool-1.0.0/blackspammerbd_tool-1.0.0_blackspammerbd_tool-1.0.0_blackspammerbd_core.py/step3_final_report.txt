  "purpose": "A simple command-line utility for file management with a rudimentary connection mechanism, allowing listing, uploading, downloading, and sharing files locally.",
  "sources": "Input commands from user via input(), filenames from command arguments, internal code variables for connection code.",
  "sinks": "File operations (os.listdir, shutil.copy), URL sharing, string comparisons for connection validation.",
  "flows": "User input -> command parsing -> method calls -> file system or URL output, with connection code validation in connect method.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, no obfuscation, no network activity, no data exfiltration, no hidden backdoors or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic CLI for file management with a simple in-memory connection code. It performs local file operations without network communication or malicious payloads. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident. The security weaknesses relate to lack of authentication, encryption, and validation, but these do not constitute malicious behavior. The code's behavior is benign, with minimal security controls, making it safe but insecure for sensitive environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward file management utility with weak security features but no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the insecure design but no active malicious intent.",
