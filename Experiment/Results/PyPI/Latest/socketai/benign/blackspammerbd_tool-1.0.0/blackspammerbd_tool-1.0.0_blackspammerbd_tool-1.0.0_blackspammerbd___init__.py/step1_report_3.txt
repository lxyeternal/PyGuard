  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources evident from this line.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified in this single line.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are visible.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a simple import of a class from a relative module. It does not execute any logic, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data directly. Without additional context or code, there is no indication of malicious behavior. The class name suggests functionality related to 'BlackSpammerBD', which could imply spam-related features, but the code itself does not show any malicious activity. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward and does not perform any harmful actions by itself.",
