  "conclusion": "The package is a basic, functional TCP file transfer utility with security weaknesses related to predictable secret code generation and unencrypted communication. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The malware score remains 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.2-0.3, which aligns with the existing reports. Overall, the code is benign but insecure for untrusted environments."
