      "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The potential risk depends on the implementation of 'cli.py', which is not available. The scores are consistent with the evidence, with a very low security risk score to account for the possible execution of external code."

There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The malware score remains 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.2-0.3, which aligns with the existing reports. Overall, the code is benign but insecure for untrusted environments."

The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the minor security concern but no active threats."

The overall security risk and malware scores should be set to 0, with a very low obfuscation score also at 0. The minimal suspicion warrants a risk score of 0."

The scores should be conservative, with malware and risk scores near zero, emphasizing the need for further investigation if additional code is available."
