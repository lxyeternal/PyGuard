  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as a placeholder comment indicating package initialization.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only a comment line present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows; code contains only a comment with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code in a package initialization context is unusual but not inherently malicious; no suspicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is purely a comment with no executable statements, import statements, or data flows. All reports correctly identify the minimal content and lack of behavior. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero; security risk is negligible. Given the absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. The minimal content may be a placeholder or incomplete snippet, but it does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of a comment. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present based on this snippet. The scores reflect this assessment, and further analysis requires additional code or context.",
