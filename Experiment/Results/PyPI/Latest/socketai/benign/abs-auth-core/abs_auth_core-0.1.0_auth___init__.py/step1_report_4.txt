  "purpose": "This code module appears to define an export list for a package, indicating it provides authentication and JWT-related functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules '.auth_functions' and '.jwt_functions'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or external inputs are referenced.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present; code only imports and exports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed. The code is straightforward and standard for Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from sibling modules and explicitly exports them via __all__, following common Python package conventions. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or external data handling observed. The code is minimal and seems to serve as a module initializer or API export point.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package export code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code fragments.",
