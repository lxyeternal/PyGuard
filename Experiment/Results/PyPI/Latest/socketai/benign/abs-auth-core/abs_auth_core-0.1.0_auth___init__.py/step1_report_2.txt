{
  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for authentication-related classes, likely for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .auth_functions and .jwt_functions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication present",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there is no data processing or untrusted data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected; only standard import/export statements",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from local modules and exposes them via __all__, which is standard practice. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. No external network calls, data leaks, or code injections are present. The structure suggests modular design, typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module export definition with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
