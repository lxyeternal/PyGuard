  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code, and evaluate the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\nfrom .auth_functions import AuthFunctions\nfrom .jwt_functions import JWTFunctions\n\n__all__ = [\"AuthFunctions\", \"JWTFunctions\"]\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code simply imports two classes from local modules and re-exports them via `__all__`.\n- There are no data flows, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- It appears to be a standard pattern for defining a public API in a Python package.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Individual Reports:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states that the code is a benign module export pattern.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** None detected.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's nature. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, confirms straightforward import/export.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No concerns.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Also consistent, notes no data handling or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1.0, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 seems slightly elevated given the code's simplicity. Since no external data or operations are involved, this should probably be 0.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a standard export pattern.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as others, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 3, the securityRisk score should be 0.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and Obfuscated Scores:\n- All reports correctly assign `malware: 0` and `obfuscated: 0`.\n- No evidence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n### Risk Scores:\n- The majority assign `securityRisk: 0` or `0.1`.\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature, **a risk score higher than 0.1 is unwarranted**.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a straightforward import/export pattern, common in Python modules.\n- No data flows, no external inputs, no suspicious constructs.\n- The slight elevation to 0.1 in some reports appears unjustified; the risk should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** Remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remain at 0.\n- **Security risk score:** Should be **0** across all reports, as there's no indication of any security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's simplicity and the thorough analysis provided.",
