  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports two classes from local modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.auth_functions and .jwt_functions)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network calls, or external data handling present",
  "flows": "Import source to __all__ export; no data flow or external influence",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static import and export pattern with no dynamic execution, data processing, or external communication. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and obfuscated scores of 0. The slight elevation of securityRisk to 0.1 in some reports appears conservative; given the simplicity, it should be 0. The code does not contain any malicious payloads or vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the benign assessment, and no anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export pattern with no malicious or security concerns. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate at 0. The risk score should be 0, reflecting no security threat.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
