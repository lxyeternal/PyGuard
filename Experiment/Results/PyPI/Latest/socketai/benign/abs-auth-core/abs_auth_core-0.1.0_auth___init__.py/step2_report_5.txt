  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code is straightforward: it imports two classes from local modules and re-exports them via `__all__`.\n   - There are no signs of data processing, network calls, dynamic code execution, or other malicious behaviors.\n   - The code does not contain any obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code appears benign and matches the report descriptions.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple module export pattern.\n   - They consistently note the absence of anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious intent.\n   - No report suggests any logical errors or security flaws.\n   - **Note:** The reports are accurate in their assessment.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence` = 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated` = 0\n     - `malware` = 0\n     - `securityRisk` = 0 or 0.1\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The slight `securityRisk` of 0.1 in some reports might be a conservative placeholder, but given the code's simplicity, even this is marginal.\n   - **Suggestion:** For such straightforward, benign code, a `securityRisk` of 0 or 0.05 might be more appropriate, but 0.1 is acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports or the code indicates any malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n   - **Conclusion:** Risk scores higher than 0.5 are unjustified; they should remain low or zero.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware` = 0.\n   - The code does not contain any malicious payloads or behaviors.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all recognize the code as a benign module export pattern.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence is high, given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n**Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.05 (very low, given the benign nature but conservative default)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a standard module export pattern with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The scores across reports are appropriate, perhaps slightly conservative on `securityRisk`. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Overall Recommendation:**\n- Keep `malware` at 0.\n- Keep `obfuscated` at 0.\n- Set `securityRisk` to 0.05 for minimal risk acknowledgment.\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and best security practices.",
