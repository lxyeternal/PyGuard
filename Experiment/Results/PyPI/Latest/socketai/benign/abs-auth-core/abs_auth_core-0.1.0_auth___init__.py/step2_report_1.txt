  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Review**:\nThe code is straightforward:\n```python\nfrom .auth_functions import AuthFunctions\nfrom .jwt_functions import JWTFunctions\n\n__all__ = [\"AuthFunctions\", \"JWTFunctions\"]\n```\nIt imports two classes from local modules and exposes them via `__all__`. There are no data flows, network calls, dynamic code execution, or other operations.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n- **Confirmed**: The code itself does not contain any malicious or suspicious content.\n- **No anomalies, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets** are detected.\n- **No external data handling or untrusted input processing** is present.\n- **No signs of malware or malicious intent** in this snippet.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n- All reports agree that this is a benign, standard module export pattern.\n- They correctly identify that the code is simple, with no data processing or external communication.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which seems appropriate given the code.\n\n4. **Scores Justification & Recommendations**:\n- **Malware score**: All reports have malware scores of 0, which is accurate.\n- **Obfuscated score**: All are 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score**: Given the code's simplicity and lack of any security concerns, a risk score of 0 or very close to 0 is justified. The reports with 0.1 are slightly conservative but acceptable, perhaps indicating minimal inherent risk due to being part of a larger project.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n- The reports are consistent and do not claim any vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n- The only minor point is the \"securityRisk\" scores of 0.1 in some reports; given the code's benign nature, I would suggest these should be 0 to reflect no risk.\n\n6. **Final Assessment**:\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- The risk score should also be 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's simplicity and the consistent, benign assessments in all reports.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always consider the broader context of the package. If this is part of a larger project, other parts might introduce risks, but based solely on this snippet, it is safe.",
