  "purpose": "This code re-exports classes from local modules for authentication and JWT handling, likely to be used elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing AuthFunctions and JWTFunctions from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; this is an import and export statement setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, indicating an intent to re-export classes for modular use. It does not process input, handle data, or perform any operations that could introduce security issues. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a module export setup without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a standard pattern in Python projects.",
