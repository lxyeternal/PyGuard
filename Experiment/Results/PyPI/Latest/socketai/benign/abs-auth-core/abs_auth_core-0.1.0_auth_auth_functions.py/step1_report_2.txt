  "purpose": "Provides user authentication functions, including updating refresh tokens and retrieving users by attributes.",
  "sources": "Database session creation (self.db()), User model attributes, method parameters (user_id, refresh_token, attribute, value).",
  "sinks": "Database queries and updates, attribute access via getattr.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (user_id, refresh_token, attribute, value) flow into database queries and attribute filters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of dynamic attribute access is standard for flexible ORM queries; no evidence of malicious intent. No external network calls, file system modifications, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard ORM patterns for querying and updating user data within a database session. The functions are designed to modify user refresh tokens and retrieve user data based on provided attributes, with appropriate exception handling. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic. The use of dynamic attribute access is typical for ORM queries and does not introduce a malicious risk in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical database access layer for user authentication purposes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on the provided code. The functions follow standard practices for database interactions with proper exception handling. No security vulnerabilities or malware detected.",
