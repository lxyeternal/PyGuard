  "purpose": "The code provides authentication-related functions to update user refresh tokens and retrieve user information based on attributes.",
  "sources": "Reads include function parameters (user_id, refresh_token, attribute, value) and database queries.",
  "sinks": "Database query methods (session.query) and data assignment to user object fields.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into database query filters and updates; data retrieved from the database is returned or modified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. Exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code uses parameterized queries via SQLAlchemy ORM, reducing SQL injection risk. No direct data leakage or insecure environment variable usage is evident. The methods perform standard database operations for user data updates and retrieval. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. The code structure and logic appear conventional for database interaction in an auth context.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward implementation of user token management and retrieval functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
