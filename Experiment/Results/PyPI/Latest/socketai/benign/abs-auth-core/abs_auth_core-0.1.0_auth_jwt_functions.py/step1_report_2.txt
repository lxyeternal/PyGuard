{
  "purpose": "This code provides JWT token handling, password hashing, and user authentication functionalities for a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, dependencies (e.g., token via Depends), and method arguments such as user_id and data.",
  "sinks": "JWT encoding/decoding, password hashing, and database updates related to tokens and user data.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into token creation, decoding, and validation functions. Tokens are generated, decoded, and used to retrieve user info. Token verification and refresh logic involve database interactions for storing and invalidating refresh tokens.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials observed; no obfuscated code; token creation and validation are standard. The code manages tokens and user info securely without evident malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard JWT and password hashing workflows for user authentication. It carefully manages token expiration, refresh, and validation, with proper exception handling for JWT errors. No suspicious code or malicious behavior detected; functions like token creation, decoding, and refresh management follow best practices. No backdoors, data leaks, or malicious network activity are present. Usage of external dependencies (jwt, fastapi, passlib) is standard and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a well-structured and typical implementation of authentication mechanisms in FastAPI, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It focuses on secure token handling and password management without suspicious or harmful behavior.",
