  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard JWT and password hashing implementation, no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code appears typical and secure. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with detailed reasoning indicating no malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Additional note:** The mention of \"UTC\" from datetime is a minor bug, not malicious.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious activity suspected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard JWT handling, password hashing, no suspicious code. Noted that 'UTC' from datetime is incorrect; should be 'timezone.utc', but this is a bug, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior; the bug is an implementation issue, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard JWT and password hashing, no signs of malicious code. External dependencies are used appropriately.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.95\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; the code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard JWT handling, password hashing, no suspicious code or secrets. No obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** No evidence in any report or code snippet.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Malware risk:** All reports assign 0, and reasoning supports this.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero, at 0.2, which is reasonable given standard practices; no hardcoded secrets or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Critical points:** The only minor issue is the incorrect use of 'UTC' from datetime, which is a bug but not malicious.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical, well-structured JWT authentication utility.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or supply chain risks are evident.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0, given no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, reflecting standard implementation with minor bugs.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n| Aspect            | Score | Justification                                                                 |\n|-------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0       | No malicious code or behavior detected.                                     |\n| Obfuscated        | 0       | Code is clear and standard.                                                  |\n| Security Risk     | 0.2     | Slight bug ('UTC' usage), but no significant vulnerabilities or secrets.    |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, secure JWT implementation with no malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The minor bug regarding 'UTC' should be fixed, but it does not impact security or indicate malicious activity.",
