  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard JWT and password hashing, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — seems slightly high but acceptable given typical risks.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is standard, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The only minor note is that the report emphasizes standard practices. The scores seem appropriate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard JWT handling, with a noted minor bug: `UTC` imported from `datetime` is invalid; should be `timezone.utc`.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — consistent with other reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Key Point:** The bug regarding `UTC` is a code correctness issue, not malicious. The malware score remains 0, which is correct.\n\n**Note:** The report's mention of the bug is valid, but it doesn't impact maliciousness or malware risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard JWT and password management, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent. No signs of malicious behavior. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard JWT implementation, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's nature. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, indicating no malicious activity. The code is standard JWT and password hashing logic.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 is consistent across reports, representing a low but non-zero risk typical for such modules.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- The only minor technical issue is the incorrect use of `UTC` from `datetime`. It should be `timezone.utc`. This is a bug, not malicious code, but worth noting for correctness.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious external communications are present.\n- The code relies on external secrets, which is standard practice, not a vulnerability.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** Keep malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, risk at 0.2.\n- **Justification:** The code is a typical JWT and password hashing utility with no malicious or obfuscated code. The only issue is a minor bug that doesn't elevate risk or malware concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                       | No malicious behavior detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                       | No obfuscation present.                                      |\n| Security Risk    | 0.2                     | Standard low risk for such modules; minor bug does not increase risk. |\n\n**Overall, the supply chain security posture of this code is sound.**",
