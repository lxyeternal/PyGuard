{
  "purpose": "Provides JWT token creation, verification, password hashing, and refresh token management for user authentication in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Reads input from token dependencies, user data for token creation, and external libraries (jwt, passlib).",
  "sinks": "Decodes tokens, verifies passwords, updates refresh tokens in the database, and retrieves token data.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into token creation functions, which produce tokens stored or sent to clients; tokens are decoded and verified during requests.",
  "anomalies": "Minor bug: uses 'UTC' from datetime instead of 'timezone.utc'; no malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard JWT handling, password hashing, and refresh token logic with proper exception handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The only technical issue is the incorrect import/use of 'UTC', which should be 'timezone.utc'. This is a bug, not malicious, and does not impact security. External dependencies are used appropriately, and no hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, secure JWT authentication utility with no malicious intent or supply chain risks. The only concern is a minor bug regarding 'UTC' usage, which should be fixed for correctness. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is zero.",
