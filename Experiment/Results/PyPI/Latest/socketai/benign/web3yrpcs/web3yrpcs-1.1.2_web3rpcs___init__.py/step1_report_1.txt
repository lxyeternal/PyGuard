  "purpose": "Importing a module or object named 'rpcs' from a local package 'web3rpcs'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module within the package.",
  "sinks": "None present in this single line of code.",
  "flows": "No data flow to or from external sources in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no obvious anomalies. The import is standard, but the nature of 'web3rpcs' depends on its implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import from a local module, likely related to Web3 RPC endpoints. No suspicious behavior such as dynamic code execution, data transmission, or hardcoded secrets is evident. Since only a single import statement is provided, there is limited context for malicious activity. Potential risk depends on the contents of 'web3rpcs' and 'rpcs', which are not shown here.",
  "conclusion": "This minimal code snippet appears benign on its own. It is a simple import statement with no clear malicious intent or security issues. Further review of the 'web3rpcs' module would be necessary to fully assess security implications.",
