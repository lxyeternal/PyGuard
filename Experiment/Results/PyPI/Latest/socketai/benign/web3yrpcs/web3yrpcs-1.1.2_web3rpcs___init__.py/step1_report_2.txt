{
  "purpose": "Importing the 'rpcs' object or module from a local 'web3rpcs' package or module, likely for interacting with Web3 RPC endpoints.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module or package named 'web3rpcs' when importing 'rpcs'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present in this single-line import statement; no untrusted data handling or external output occurs here.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows in this snippet; it's a static import statement without execution of untrusted input or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are visible in this single line.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a standard import of 'rpcs' from a relative module '.web3rpcs'. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior in this line. It appears to be part of a larger project structure. Without additional context, it is a normal import statement with no apparent security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet alone, the code is a simple module import with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The presence of 'web3rpcs' suggests blockchain-related functionality, but no malicious activity can be inferred from this line.",
