  "purpose": "Importing the 'rpcs' object or module from the local 'web3rpcs' package or module.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'web3rpcs' module from the same package or directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data handling are evident in this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "This code only imports 'rpcs' from a local module '.web3rpcs'. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, no external network calls, data handling, or suspicious operations. Since it's a simple import, it does not pose an immediate risk. However, the actual content of 'web3rpcs' could contain malicious code, but that cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited code provided, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The import is standard and does not exhibit any malicious patterns. Confidence is high that this is benign given the context.",
