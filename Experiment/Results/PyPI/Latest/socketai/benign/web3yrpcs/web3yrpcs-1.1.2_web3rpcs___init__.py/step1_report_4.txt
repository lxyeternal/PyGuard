  "purpose": "Import the 'rpcs' object or module from the local 'web3rpcs' package or module.",
  "sources": "Import statement reads from a local module/file 'web3rpcs'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in this snippet; potential sinks depend on how 'rpcs' is used later.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to importing 'rpcs' from 'web3rpcs'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in this single-line import statement; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, importing 'rpcs' from a local module 'web3rpcs'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flow in this snippet. The presence of 'web3rpcs' suggests interaction with Web3 RPC endpoints, but without further context, this is standard for blockchain-related packages. No indicators of malicious code, such as network activity, data leaks, or backdoors, are present in this single line.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports a component for use elsewhere, likely related to Web3 RPCs. No malicious behavior or anomalies are detected in this fragment.",
