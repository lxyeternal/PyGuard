{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module or object named 'rpcs' from a local package or module named 'web3rpcs'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module 'web3rpcs'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present in this snippet; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident; the code only imports a resource.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, and no suspicious or unusual behavior is apparent; the import could be benign or malicious depending on 'web3rpcs'.",
  "analysis": "The snippet consists solely of an import statement. Without additional context about the contents of 'web3rpcs' or its usage, it is impossible to determine if malicious activity exists. The import could be part of legitimate functionality or malicious code hiding within the module. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are visible here. The code's simplicity limits the ability to assess malicious intent definitively.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior. The code appears benign but depends on the contents of 'web3rpcs'. Further review of the 'web3rpcs' module is necessary for a comprehensive security assessment.",
