  "purpose": "Import the 'rpcs' object from the local 'web3rpcs' module, likely for blockchain/Web3 interactions.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; the module 'web3rpcs' and its contents are external and not shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of 'rpcs' could involve network communication, data handling, or blockchain interactions, but none are evident here.",
  "flows": "Importing 'rpcs' from 'web3rpcs' without further code; actual data flow depends on subsequent usage, which is not provided.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in this minimal import statement; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of 'rpcs' from 'web3rpcs'. It appears benign with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues evident in this snippet. The security implications depend on the content of 'web3rpcs', which is unknown. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by the minimal and standard nature of the import. All reports correctly identify the benign appearance and acknowledge that further review of the module's content is necessary for a comprehensive security assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and poses no immediate security threat. The overall scores are appropriate; the malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and risk is minimal. The primary concern is the content of 'web3rpcs', which should be reviewed separately. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security issues from this code snippet alone.",
