  "purpose": "The code attempts to query an external API endpoint with provided data, possibly for validation or checking purposes.",
  "sources": "The data parameter passed to the rpcs function, used in constructing the URL for the GET request.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call, which sends data over the network to an external server.",
  "flows": "Input data -> requests.get URL construction -> external API request",
  "anomalies": "The function does not process or validate the input data; it simply uses it to make an external request without sanitization. The response is ignored, and exceptions are caught silently without logging or alerting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function rpcs that takes input data and makes an HTTP GET request to a specific external API endpoint, embedding the data directly into the URL. It handles request exceptions but does not process or verify the response. There are no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no signs of malicious payloads or backdoors. The silent failure handling suggests an intent to perform external lookups or checks quietly. However, the code's simplicity and direct external call could be used maliciously if the data parameter is controlled maliciously, leading to potential misuse or unintended external interactions, but there is no explicit malicious behavior present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward external API call with user-provided data, which could be part of a larger malicious scheme if misused. However, as it stands, there is no direct evidence of malicious intent or malware. It appears to be a benign function, but the lack of input validation and response handling warrants caution.",
