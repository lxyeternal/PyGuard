{
  "purpose": "The function 'rpcs' is designed to perform an HTTP GET request to a specified URL, likely to check or retrieve data related to the input 'data'.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'data' is used to construct the URL in the requests.get call, reading data that could influence the request URL.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get function is the sink where untrusted 'data' influences external network communication, potentially leading to malicious interactions if 'data' is manipulated.",
  "flows": "The flow is from 'data' (source) into the URL string construction, then into requests.get (sink) which makes an external network request based on 'data'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code structures are present. The exception handling is broad but does not perform any malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'requests' to perform an HTTP GET request to an external API endpoint, using 'data' as a path parameter. The try-except block catches request exceptions but does not process or log them, simply returning None. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side effects. The URL appears to be related to a blockchain or EVM check, which is consistent with a legitimate data retrieval task. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward API request based on input data without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
