  "purpose": "The function 'rpcs' is designed to send an HTTP GET request to a specified API endpoint with the provided data embedded in the URL.",
  "sources": "The function receives input data via the parameter 'data', which is used directly in constructing the URL for the request.",
  "sinks": "The request to an external API endpoint, which could potentially send or receive data over the network.",
  "flows": "Input 'data' is inserted into the URL, which is then used in the requests.get call. The response is not processed or validated further.",
  "anomalies": "The function suppresses all exceptions by returning None, which may hide errors but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple GET request to a specified URL with user-provided data. It includes exception handling but no further processing of the response. The URL appears to be a legitimate API endpoint. No indicators of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The function does not perform any harmful actions or obscure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward HTTP request wrapper without malicious behavior. It appears to be a utility function for querying an external API, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
