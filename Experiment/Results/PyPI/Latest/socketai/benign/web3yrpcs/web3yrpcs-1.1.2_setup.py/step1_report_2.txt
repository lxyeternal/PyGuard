  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'web3yrpcs' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description; reads package information for setup.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data processing or external effects.",
  "flows": "Reads external files for metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'open' to read 'README.md' without validation, but this is standard practice; no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and configuration. It reads a README file for the long description, which is common. No user input, network calls, or dynamic code execution present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors identified. The code structure is straightforward and standard for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
