  "purpose": "Setup script for configuring and distributing the 'web3yrpcs' Python package",
  "sources": "open('README.md').read() - reading long description from a file",
  "sinks": "N/A - no direct untrusted data output or sensitive data handling",
  "flows": "N/A - straightforward package setup without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read a file without exception handling; no validation or sanitization, but common in setup scripts",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup configuration using setuptools. It defines package metadata, including name, version, author, description, and URL. The only notable action is reading 'README.md' for the long description, which is typical for package setup. There are no suspicious imports, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no handling of untrusted input. All elements are typical for a setup script, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a conventional setup configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or anomalous behavior.",
