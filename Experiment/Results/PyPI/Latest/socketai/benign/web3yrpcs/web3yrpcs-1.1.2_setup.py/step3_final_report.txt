  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' and passing package metadata to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without a context manager; no exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools. It reads a local README.md file to populate long_description, which is common practice. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or processing of untrusted input is present. The use of open() without a context manager is a minor best practice concern but not malicious. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign package setup file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The minor issue with open() can be improved but does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, and the scores assigned are appropriate.",
