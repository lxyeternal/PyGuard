  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python script that performs some form of data processing or utility function, but without the actual code provided, the specific intent cannot be confirmed.",
  "sources": "Data sources include reading environment variables, input functions, or file I/O operations (if present in the code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, subprocess calls, or writing to system files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks (e.g., network, file system) via intermediate processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without actual code; however, look for hardcoded credentials, unusual dynamic code execution, or obfuscated segments.",
  "analysis": "Since the code itself is not provided, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. The evaluation depends on inspecting code structure, variable usage, external calls, and any suspicious patterns. No specific anomalies are identifiable without code details. If the code includes standard library usage, third-party libraries, or system calls, these should be reviewed for malicious intent. The presence of obfuscated code, malicious API calls, or data exfiltration routines would be critical red flags, but none can be confirmed here.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of actual code, there is currently no evidence of malicious behavior. The security risk appears low, but a definitive assessment requires review of the actual code content.",
