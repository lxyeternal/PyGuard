  "conclusion": "The assessments are cautious and appropriate given the limited information. The primary concern is the use of eval/exec functions without sanitization, which warrants further review but does not confirm malicious intent. Scores across reports are consistent and reflect the low likelihood of malicious activity in most cases, with a moderate risk in report 5 due to risky functions."
