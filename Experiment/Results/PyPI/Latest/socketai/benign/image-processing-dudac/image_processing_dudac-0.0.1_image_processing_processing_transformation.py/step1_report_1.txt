  "purpose": "Resize an input image by a specified proportion using skimage.transform.resize.",
  "sources": "Reads image.shape to determine original dimensions and takes 'proportion' as input parameter.",
  "sinks": "Returns the resized image; no direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input 'proportion' influences calculated 'height' and 'width'; these are used in resize to produce the output image.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known image processing function, defines a straightforward resize operation with input validation, and returns the resized image. No external data transmission, malicious logic, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears standard and legitimate for image resizing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, benign image resizing operation with proper input validation. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
