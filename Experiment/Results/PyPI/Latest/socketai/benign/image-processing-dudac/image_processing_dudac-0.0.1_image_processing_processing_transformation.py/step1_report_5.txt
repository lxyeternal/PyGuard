{
  "purpose": "Resize an input image based on a specified proportion, primarily for image processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'image' (expected to be an image array), and 'proportion' (a float between 0 and 1).",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'resize' function from 'skimage.transform', which processes the image data; no other sinks for untrusted data are evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'image' and 'proportion' flow into the 'resize_image' function, which computes new dimensions and passes data to 'resize', returning the resized image.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code performs a straightforward image resize operation without external network calls or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a resizing function from a reputable library, defines a function to resize images based on a proportion, and asserts valid input ranges. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior. It performs a simple calculation and calls a standard image processing library function. No data leaks, network activity, or harmful operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign image resizing utility with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
