  "purpose": "Resize an input image by a given proportion using skimage.transform.resize.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'image' and 'proportion'; 'image.shape' for dimensions.",
  "sinks": "Return of 'image_resized' after processing.",
  "flows": "Input 'image' -> dimension calculation -> resize() function -> output 'image_resized'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to resize images based on a proportion, asserting that the proportion is between 0 and 1. It calculates new dimensions and uses skimage's resize function with anti_aliasing enabled. The code is straightforward and appears to serve a legitimate image processing purpose without any obfuscated or malicious constructs. There are no external network calls, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard image resizing operation without any signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears safe and typical for image processing tasks.",
