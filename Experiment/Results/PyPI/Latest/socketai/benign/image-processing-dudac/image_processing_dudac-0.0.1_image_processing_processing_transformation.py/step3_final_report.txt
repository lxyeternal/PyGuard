{
  "purpose": "A simple image resizing function that adjusts image dimensions based on a proportion parameter.",
  "sources": "Input image data (image parameter), proportion parameter from function argument",
  "sinks": "Resized image output (returned by the function)",
  "flows": "Input image and proportion flow into calculations for new dimensions, then into the resize function, resulting in the resized image output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with proper validation and no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard image processing function, validates input, calculates new dimensions, and performs resizing with anti-aliasing. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code does not transmit data, use credentials, or perform dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The logic is sound, and no vulnerabilities or malicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard image resizing utility with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
