{
  "purpose": "Resize an image proportionally using skimage.transform.resize.",
  "sources": "Reads input image (image parameter) and proportion value (proportion parameter).",
  "sinks": "Returns resized image; no sinks that lead to data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input image and proportion flow into resize function; output is resized image.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code asserts the validity of the proportion parameter, calculates new dimensions based on the proportion, and resizes the image using skimage.transform.resize with anti-aliasing enabled. All operations are standard image processing procedures without external network activity or malicious intent. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward image resizing function with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
