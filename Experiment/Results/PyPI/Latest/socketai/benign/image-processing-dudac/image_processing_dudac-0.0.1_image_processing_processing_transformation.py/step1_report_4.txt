  "purpose": "Resize an image proportionally using skimage.transform.resize.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'image' (image data), 'proportion' (resize factor).",
  "sinks": "Returned 'image_resized'. No untrusted data is written or sent outside the function.",
  "flows": "Input 'image' and 'proportion' flow into resize calculation; output is 'image_resized'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual language features, or obfuscation. No network calls or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard image processing function, defines a straightforward resize operation with validation on 'proportion'. It computes new dimensions based on the input image shape and the given proportion, then resizes the image accordingly. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be a standard utility function for image resizing, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign image resizing utility with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
