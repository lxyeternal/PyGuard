  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, potentially for data processing or utility functions, but no specific purpose is clearly identified due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include environment variables, input functions, or external data files, but none are explicitly present in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications are apparent in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows identified within this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated segments, or unusual language features. No suspicious or malicious code structures are observed.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review shows standard Python syntax with no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security issues. The code does not perform any suspicious network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. Usage of third-party libraries, if any, appears typical and not inherently malicious. The code structure is straightforward, with no hidden backdoors or malicious intent detected. Without additional context or external interactions, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this isolated code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems safe and normal in function, with no indications of malware, supply chain attacks, or security issues.",
