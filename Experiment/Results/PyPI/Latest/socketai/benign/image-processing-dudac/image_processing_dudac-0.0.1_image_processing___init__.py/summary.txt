  "malware_score": 0.4,
  "security_risk": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0.5,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The source code shows moderate suspicion primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic execution functions. While no explicit malicious actions are confirmed, patterns suggest potential for abuse. The overall security risk is moderate, and further review of actual code snippets is recommended to confirm the threat level."
