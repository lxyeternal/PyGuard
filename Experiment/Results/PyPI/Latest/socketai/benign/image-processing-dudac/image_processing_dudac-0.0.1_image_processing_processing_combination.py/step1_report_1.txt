{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to compare two images for differences and perform histogram matching for color transfer between images.",
  "sources": "Reads input images through function parameters (image1, image2); uses functions rgb2gray and match_histograms which internally process image data",
  "sinks": "Outputs the normalized difference image and the histogram-matched image; does not include any network or system calls",
  "flows": "Images are taken as input, processed for similarity and histogram transfer, then outputted; no external data flows or external system interaction",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code or malicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports common image processing libraries and performs standard operations: image comparison via structural similarity index, histogram matching, normalization. The functions are straightforward, intended for image analysis. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The assert statement ensures input images are of the same shape, which is standard. The print statement for similarity score is harmless. Overall, the code performs typical image processing tasks without any suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign image comparison and histogram matching utility with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
