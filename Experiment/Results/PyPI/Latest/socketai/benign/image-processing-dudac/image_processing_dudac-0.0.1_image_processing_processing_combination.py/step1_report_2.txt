  "purpose": "The code performs image comparison and histogram matching to analyze differences and transfer histogram properties between two images.",
  "sources": "Reads two image inputs (image1 and image2) passed as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions identified.",
  "flows": "Input images are processed through color conversion, similarity scoring, normalization, and histogram matching without passing data to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Functions use standard image processing library calls.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard scientific image processing libraries and defines two functions: 'find_difference' for computing similarity and difference images, and 'transfer_histogram' for matching histograms between images. 'find_difference' asserts matching shapes, converts images to grayscale, computes structural similarity, normalizes the difference image, and returns it. 'transfer_histogram' applies histogram matching with multichannel support. No malicious code, external data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. All functions perform typical image processing operations with no hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate image comparison and processing tasks with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
