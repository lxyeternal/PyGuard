{
  "purpose": "The code is intended for image comparison and histogram transfer to analyze differences and match histograms between two images.",
  "sources": "Reads input images (image1, image2) passed as function arguments",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or system effects",
  "flows": "Input images are processed to compute similarity scores and histogram matching without any external or untrusted data flows that cause harm",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected; no obfuscation or unusual language features",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard image processing functions from established libraries (numpy, skimage). It compares images by converting them to grayscale, computes structural similarity, and normalizes the difference image. It also performs histogram matching. All operations are typical for image processing and do not involve any suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign image processing utility with no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
