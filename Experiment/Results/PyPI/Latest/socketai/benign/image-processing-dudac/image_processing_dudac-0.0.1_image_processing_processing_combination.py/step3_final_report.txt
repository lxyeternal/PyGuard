{
  "purpose": "The code performs image comparison using structural similarity and normalizes the difference image, along with histogram matching for color transfer.",
  "sources": "Reads input images as function parameters; no external data sources or user input within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no network or external system interactions; outputs are returned or printed locally.",
  "flows": "Input images are processed through functions; similarity score is printed; normalized difference and matched images are returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard libraries and functions; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing standard image processing tasks with well-known libraries. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No logical flaws or security issues are identified. The minimal security risk score reflects the inherent risk in image processing code but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard image comparison and histogram matching without any malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
