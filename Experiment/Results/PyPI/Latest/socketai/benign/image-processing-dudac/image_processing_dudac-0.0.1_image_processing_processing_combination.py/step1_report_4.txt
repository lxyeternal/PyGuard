{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to analyze differences between two images and perform histogram matching to transfer visual characteristics from one image to another.",
  "sources": "Input images 'image1' and 'image2' passed to functions 'find_difference' and 'transfer_histogram'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; functions process images in memory and print similarity score; no network or file output observed.",
  "flows": "Images are read as inputs, processed via grayscale conversion, similarity calculation, and histogram matching. No data flows to external systems or insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. Uses standard libraries for image processing. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common image processing libraries, defines functions for image comparison and histogram transfer, and performs assertions and calculations securely. It only processes images provided as parameters without external data sources or sinks. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard image processing operations for comparing and modifying images. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be legitimate image analysis code without harmful behavior.",
