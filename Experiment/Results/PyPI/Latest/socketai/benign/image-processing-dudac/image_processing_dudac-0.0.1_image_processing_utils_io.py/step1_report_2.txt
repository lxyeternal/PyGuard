{
  "purpose": "The code provides simple functions to read and save images using the skimage library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'path' parameter in both read_image() and save_image() functions, which are user-provided file paths.",
  "sinks": "The save_image() function writes to a file specified by the user; however, there are no other sinks such as network transmission or environment variable usage.",
  "flows": "Input from 'path' in read_image() flows into imread(), and output from imread() is returned. In save_image(), the image data flows into imsave() along with the user-specified 'path'. No external or untrusted data flows beyond file read/write operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The functions perform straightforward file I/O without hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two functions: one to read an image from a specified path and another to save an image to a specified path. Both functions rely on the skimage library. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code does not process or manipulate data in a suspicious manner beyond standard image I/O. The file paths are taken as parameters, which could be user input, but that alone does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard image read/write operations with no indications of malicious behavior. It appears to be a simple utility module without malicious intent or security risks.",
