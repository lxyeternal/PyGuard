  "purpose": "To provide functions for reading and saving images using the skimage library.",
  "sources": "The function read_image reads data from a file specified by 'path'.",
  "sinks": "The function save_image writes image data to a file specified by 'path'.",
  "flows": "Input file path -> imread -> return image; Image data -> imsave -> output file path",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, and no hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports image reading and saving functions from skimage.io. It defines two straightforward functions: 'read_image' reads an image from a given path, optionally converting it to grayscale, and returns the image object. 'save_image' saves an image object to a specified path. Both functions perform standard image I/O operations with no unusual logic, no dynamic code execution, and no external network activity. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads present. The code is simple and appears to be a utility for image processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility for image I/O operations with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward implementation without obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
