{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for reading and saving images using the skimage library.",
  "sources": "The 'read_image' function reads data from a file path provided as an argument; 'save_image' writes image data to a specified file path.",
  "sinks": "The 'imsave' function writes image data to disk; 'imread' reads image data from disk.",
  "flows": "Input file path -> imread -> image data -> save_image -> imsave -> file output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious function calls, and no obfuscated code. Usage of standard library functions without additional logic appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: 'read_image' and 'save_image'. 'read_image' loads an image from a specified path, optionally converting it to grayscale, using 'imread'. 'save_image' writes image data to a specified path using 'imsave'. Both functions rely on standard skimage library functions, which are common for image processing tasks. There are no suspicious code patterns, no external network activity, and no hardcoded secrets. The code performs straightforward I/O operations, typical in image processing workflows. No anomalies or malicious intent are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple utility for reading and saving images, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard, well-known library functions for common image I/O tasks. The code appears safe and does not pose security concerns.",
