{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to read and save images using skimage.io.",
  "sources": "The functions read input file paths for images in read_image and save image data in save_image.",
  "sinks": "The save_image function writes image data to the specified file path.",
  "flows": "Input file path -> imread -> output image data -> save_image -> file path",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code imports image reading and writing functions from skimage.io. It defines read_image, which reads an image from a given path, optionally in grayscale, and returns it. It also defines save_image, which saves the provided image data to a specified path. There are no user inputs beyond file paths, no network activity, and no suspicious code structures. The functions are straightforward and do not contain any malicious logic or obfuscation. The code appears to perform simple image I/O operations without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing basic image read/write functions without any malicious intent or security risks.",
