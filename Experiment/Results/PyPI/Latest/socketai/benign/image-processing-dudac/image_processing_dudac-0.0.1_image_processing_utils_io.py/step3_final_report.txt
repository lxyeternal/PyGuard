  "purpose": "Simple utility functions for reading and saving images using skimage.io.",
  "sources": "File paths provided to read_image and save_image functions.",
  "sinks": "File system operations; no untrusted data flow leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input file path -> imread; Image data -> imsave; Output file path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises two functions: read_image, which loads an image from a given path with optional grayscale conversion, and save_image, which saves an image to a specified path. Both functions utilize standard skimage.io methods without any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or network activity. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest benign intent. All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious payloads, data leaks, or security flaws. The code is a standard utility module, and the scores are consistent with its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports accurately assess its benign nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
