  "purpose": "To provide functions for reading and saving images using skimage library.",
  "sources": "The function read_image reads image data from a specified file path.",
  "sinks": "The function save_image writes image data to a specified file path.",
  "flows": "read_image takes a file path as input, loads image data, which can then be passed to save_image to write to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no unusual or obfuscated code structures, no network activity, no embedded backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports image I/O functions from skimage, defines a straightforward read function that loads an image from disk, optionally in grayscale, and a save function that writes image data to disk. There are no hardcoded secrets, no external network calls, no data exfiltration, or other suspicious behaviors. Usage of skimage.io is standard for image processing tasks. The code structure is simple and does not include any obfuscation or unusual constructs. The functions operate on provided file paths and image data, which are typical in image processing workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign image I/O utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard operations with no hidden malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
