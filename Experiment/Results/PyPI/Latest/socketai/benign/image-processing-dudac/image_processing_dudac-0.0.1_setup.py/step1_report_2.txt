{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package for distribution, specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, and uses setuptools to configure package setup.",
  "targets": "No specific untrusted input handling or external data output; standard package setup process.",
  "flows": "Reads files -> passes data to setup() -> package configuration; no untrusted data flows to execution beyond standard setup procedures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements observed. The code performs straightforward package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup, reads a README file for long description, and reads requirements from a text file. It then calls setup() with package metadata, including name, version, author, description, URL, packages (found via find_packages()), dependencies, and Python version requirement. All operations are standard for Python package setup, with no suspicious behavior or malicious code detected. The code is simple, transparent, and adheres to common practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is designed solely for package configuration and distribution.",
