{
  "purpose": "This code is used for setting up and installing a Python package called 'image_processing_dudac' with its dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data is processed in a way that leads to data leaks or system effects",
  "flows": "Reading files to gather package description and requirements; passing dependencies to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. Usage of standard setup tools and straightforward file reading.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup procedures: reading a README file for long description, reading a requirements file for dependencies, and calling setuptools.setup() with package metadata. All operations are standard and do not involve dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows conventional patterns and does not contain any suspicious code or anomalies.",
