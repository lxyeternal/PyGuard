{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'image_processing_dudac', intended to specify package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, and uses 'setuptools' functions to define package setup.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data is processed or executed in a manner that can cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "Reads static files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt'), then passes the data to 'setup()' functions for package configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code follows standard package setup procedures without unusual or suspicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading description and requirements files, and invoking 'setup()' with package metadata. It uses 'find_packages()' to include all packages. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The dependencies are loaded from a requirements file, which appears to be a typical practice. Overall, the code is straightforward and adheres to normal packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is a typical implementation for package distribution without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
