  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\nThe provided code is a standard Python package setup script. It reads static files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') and invokes `setuptools.setup()` with typical metadata. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The logic is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- The code is benign.\n- No suspicious or malicious code present.\n- No untrusted data handling or external network activity.\n- No obfuscation or backdoors.\n\n### Potential issues or points to consider:\n- The use of `find_packages()` and reading files is standard.\n- No validation or sanitization of the contents of 'requirements.txt' or 'README.md' is performed, but this is typical for setup scripts.\n- The reports consistently agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n**Malware Score:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- No evidence suggests any malicious intent or behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**\n- All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is correct.\n- The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n\n**Risk Score:**\n- All reports assign a risk score of 0, which is justified.\n- The script performs standard package setup tasks without security implications.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review of the Reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- No report claims or implies any vulnerability, backdoor, or malicious activity.\n- The reasoning is sound: the code is typical for a setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard setup script with no security risks or malicious behavior.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and reasoning provided.",
