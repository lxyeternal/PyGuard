{
  "purpose": "This code sets up the configuration for a Python package named 'image_processing_dudac', including reading description and requirements files and invoking setup() to prepare the package for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, and user-supplied package information for setup()",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data; setup() uses provided files and parameters only",
  "flows": "Read files (README.md and requirements.txt) -> store content in variables -> pass variables to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no unusual dynamic execution, and no obfuscated patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures, reading static files and calling setup() with user-specified parameters. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. Usage of 'setuptools' and file reading is typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
