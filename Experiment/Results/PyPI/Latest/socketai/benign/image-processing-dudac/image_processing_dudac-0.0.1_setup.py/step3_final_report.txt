  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for distributing the 'image_processing_dudac' package.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, and static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity, code execution, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Reading static files ('README.md', 'requirements.txt') and passing data to setuptools.setup() without dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools, performing standard operations: reading static files and invoking setup() with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code adheres to common packaging practices and contains no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
