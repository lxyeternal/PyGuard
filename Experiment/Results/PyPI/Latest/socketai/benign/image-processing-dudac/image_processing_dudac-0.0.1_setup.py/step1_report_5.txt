{
  "purpose": "This code is setting up a Python package for distribution, specifically an image processing package called 'image_processing_dudac'.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for the long description; reading requirements.txt for dependencies; calling setup() for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writing, or execution are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') into variables, then into setup() parameters; no untrusted data flows into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. The code is standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') to configure package metadata. It then calls setuptools.setup() with package details. All operations are standard for packaging, with no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No network activity, code execution beyond setup configuration, or obfuscated logic is present. The use of 'find_packages()' is typical for including all sub-packages. The code does not handle any untrusted input or perform any unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The overall security risk is negligible.",
