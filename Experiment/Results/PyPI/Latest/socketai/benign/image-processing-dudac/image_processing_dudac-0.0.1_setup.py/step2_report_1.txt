  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected.\n- The code reads static files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') and calls `setup()` with package metadata.\n- No untrusted data handling, dynamic code execution, network activity, or secret handling is observed.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0 and security risks of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: it is a typical `setup.py` for packaging.\n- No issues are present in the code itself based on the reports.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code performs only standard package setup operations with no suspicious behavior, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n- No need to increase scores unless malicious activity or vulnerabilities are detected.\n\n### Potential assumptions:\n- The reports assume that reading static files and calling `setup()` is safe, which is correct.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made; the analysis is based on code content.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores align with the analysis; no inconsistencies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that. No changes are necessary.",
