{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to visualize images and their histograms using matplotlib, mainly for displaying images and their color histograms.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'image' parameter in each function, which is expected to be a NumPy array representing image data.",
  "sinks": "The code only calls matplotlib functions to display images and histograms; there are no sinks that send data over a network or write to files.",
  "flows": "Input images are passed to plotting functions, which generate visual outputs; no data flows to external systems or insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or malicious behavior are observed. The code performs standard plotting tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three functions: 'plot_image' for displaying a single grayscale image, 'plot_result' for displaying multiple images with titles, and 'plot_histogram' for showing histograms of RGB channels. All functions use standard matplotlib procedures, with no signs of obfuscated or suspicious code. There are no input/output operations beyond visualization, and no external data connections or data leaks are present. The code appears to be straightforward visualization utilities, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of image visualization functions using matplotlib with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely for display purposes and does not include any suspicious or harmful operations.",
