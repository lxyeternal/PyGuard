{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization functions for displaying images and histograms using matplotlib.",
  "sources": "The code reads image data passed as function arguments (images).",
  "sinks": "The code displays images and histograms via matplotlib; no data is transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Input images are processed within functions to generate visual outputs; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is straightforward visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three functions: plot_image, plot_result, and plot_histogram, all using matplotlib for visualization. They accept image data (assumed to be NumPy arrays) and display images or histograms. There are no external data flows, network activity, or file I/O. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is benign, intended solely for visualization purposes. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign visualization utility with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
