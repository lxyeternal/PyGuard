{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for visualizing images and histograms using matplotlib.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the functions: 'image' for plot_image and plot_histogram; multiple images for plot_result.",
  "sinks": "plt.show() calls which display visual output; no data is transmitted externally or used maliciously.",
  "flows": "Image data flows from input parameters into plotting functions and is displayed locally; no external network or data leaks are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code uses standard plotting functions with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three visualization functions: one for a single image, one for multiple images, and one for image histograms. All functions utilize matplotlib for displaying images and histograms, with no external data fetching, network activity, or file operations. The functions are straightforward and contain no malicious logic or suspicious patterns. They only process and visualize provided image data locally.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs benign image visualization tasks with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely uses standard plotting routines without external communication or data manipulation beyond display.",
