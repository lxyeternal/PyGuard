{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to visualize images and their histograms using matplotlib, likely for image analysis or processing tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'image' parameter passed to each function; specifically, 'image' is used as input for plotting and histogram calculations.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit data; it only visualizes the input images locally using matplotlib, with no external network or file system side effects.",
  "flows": "Image data is passed from the function caller to visualization functions, where 'image' is used directly for plotting and histogram computation; no external data flows or untrusted data pipelines are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious data handling, or unusual code structures are present. The code uses standard matplotlib plotting routines without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three visualization functions for displaying images and histograms, utilizing matplotlib. It assumes 'image' is a NumPy array with appropriate dimensions. There are no external data sources, network connections, or suspicious code behaviors. The functions are straightforward, with no evident malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for visualization purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The functions are standard plotting routines with no suspicious elements.",
