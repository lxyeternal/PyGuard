{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for visualizing images and their histograms using matplotlib.",
  "sources": "Input images provided as function arguments, especially in plot_image, plot_result, and plot_histogram.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions write data to external systems, files, or network; they only display images and histograms.",
  "flows": "Images are passed into functions, used for plotting, and displayed via matplotlib's show() method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. No external network access or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports matplotlib for visualization purposes and defines three functions: plot_image (displays a single image), plot_result (displays multiple images with titles), and plot_histogram (creates histograms for RGB channels). There are no inputs to the functions that suggest malicious data flow. The code solely visualizes data and does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or security-sensitive actions. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The structure is straightforward and typical for visualization tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard image visualization utility with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is safe for use.",
