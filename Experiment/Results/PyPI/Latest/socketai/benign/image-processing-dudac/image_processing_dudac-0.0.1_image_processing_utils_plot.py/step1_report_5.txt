{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for visualizing images and histograms using matplotlib.",
  "sources": "The code reads image data passed as function arguments (image, multiple images, or image arrays).",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external locations, send data over the network, or execute untrusted code. It only visualizes data within the environment.",
  "flows": "Image data flows from input parameters to plotting functions for visualization. There are no external data flows or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be straightforward visualization functions with standard library usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports matplotlib for visualization and defines three functions: plot_image, plot_result, and plot_histogram. Each function creates plots based on provided image data, with no user input handling or external data fetching. The functions only visualize data passed as parameters, with no signs of malicious activities like data exfiltration, network access, or code injection. No obfuscation or unusual language features are present. The code is clean, well-structured, and standard for image visualization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign image visualization utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely visualizes provided image data without external interactions or malicious behavior.",
