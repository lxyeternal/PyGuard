  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign or minimal, with Report 2 being the most suspicious due to obfuscation and dynamic execution. The overall malware likelihood is moderate, and the security risk is elevated primarily because of obfuscation techniques. No definitive malicious activity is confirmed, but caution is advised. The existing scores are appropriate, with a slight increase in malware suspicion for Report 2 to better reflect the obfuscation techniques employed."
