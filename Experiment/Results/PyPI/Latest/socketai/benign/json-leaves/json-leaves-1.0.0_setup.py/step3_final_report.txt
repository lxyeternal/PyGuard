  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining metadata, reading README.md, and setting up CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, importing 'setuptools' and 'distutils.core', defining 'entry_points' for CLI.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of 'json_leaves.main:main' when CLI command is run; no direct untrusted data handling or network activity in setup script.",
  "flows": "Setup script loads package info, reads README.md, and registers CLI command; actual execution depends on 'main()' implementation.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'distutils.core'; reading 'README.md' without validation; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with standard practices. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The reading of README.md is typical, and the CLI entry point is standard. No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated code. The assigned scores accurately reflect its benign nature. No further security concerns are identified based on this code snippet.",
