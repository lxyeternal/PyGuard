  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'json-leaves' Python package, intended to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file to obtain the long description during setup.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted data or external commands.",
  "flows": "Reads package metadata and description file, then passes data to setuptools.setup() for installation.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open('README.md').read() without validation, but this is standard for setup scripts; no suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard packaging libraries, defines package metadata, and specifies an entry point for a CLI tool. It reads the README.md file directly, which is typical for setup scripts. No code injections, environment variable misuse, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward and aligns with common package setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and entry points.",
