{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'json-leaves' Python package, enabling installation and command-line execution.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata (name, version, author, description, etc.), reads 'README.md' file for long description, defines console script entry point.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of 'main' function in 'json_leaves.main' module via command line entry point.",
  "flows": "User runs 'json-leaves' command -> invokes 'json_leaves.main:main' function -> execution flow depends on that function's implementation.",
  "anomalies": "Reads the 'README.md' file directly during setup; no other suspicious code or dynamic code execution detected. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools, with typical metadata and a CLI entry point. It imports 'setuptools' and 'distutils.core' but only utilizes 'setuptools.setup', which is common. Reading 'README.md' for the long description is typical but could be a minor source of failure if the file is missing, yet not malicious. No suspicious logic, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior present. The entry point points to a main function in the 'json_leaves' package, which is standard practice for CLI tools. No signs of code injection, data leaks, or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a conventional Python package setup configuration with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution and command-line use.",
