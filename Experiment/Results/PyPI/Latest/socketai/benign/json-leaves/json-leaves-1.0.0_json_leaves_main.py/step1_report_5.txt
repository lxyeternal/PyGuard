{
  "purpose": "The script extracts and formats paths to leaves in a JSON structure, supporting multiple output formats and path styles.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON data from standard input.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted paths and values to standard output; no direct untrusted data sink involved.",
  "flows": "Input JSON data -> get_nodes function -> filtering based on args -> formatted output (paths/values) to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns present. Uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code reads JSON data, traverses the structure, and outputs paths or values in various formats depending on command-line arguments. The get_nodes function generates nodes and leaves, with no risky dynamic code execution or insecure handling of data. The path formatting functions are simple string manipulations without security concerns. The main function filters and formats data based on user options, with no evident malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for JSON path extraction with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely on input data and produces formatted output without any insecure practices.",
