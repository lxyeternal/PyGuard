{
  "purpose": "The script extracts and displays paths to leaves or nodes from JSON data, supporting multiple output formats and path styles.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON input from stdin and command-line arguments for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout in various formats; no direct sinks for untrusted data processing or external network interaction.",
  "flows": "Input JSON read -> data processing -> formatted output based on command-line options.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Uses standard libraries and straightforward control flow. No obfuscation or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code processes JSON data to extract paths and values, providing multiple output formats controlled by command-line options. It employs safe functions like json.dumps for quoting and formatting. No external network communication, file manipulation, or sensitive data handling observed. The code structure is clear and does not include suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscated code. Command-line argument parsing is standard and does not introduce security concerns. The code appears benign with respect to security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard utility for JSON path extraction and formatting. No malicious behavior, security risks, or malware indicators are present. It operates purely locally with no external communication or harmful operations.",
