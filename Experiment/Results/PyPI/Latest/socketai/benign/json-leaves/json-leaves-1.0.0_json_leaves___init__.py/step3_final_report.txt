  "purpose": "Evaluate the supply chain security and malicious potential of the provided Python code or its absence.",
  "sources": "No code provided; analysis based on code presence or absence, and any described data flows.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified due to lack of code; potential sinks discussed hypothetically in some reports.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows can be established without code; some reports mention typical data flows but lack actual implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; all reports correctly note missing or incomplete code, leading to conservative assessments.",
  "analysis": "All reports acknowledge the absence or incompleteness of code, resulting in zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risks. The confidence scores are low (around 0.3) when partial code is mentioned, reflecting uncertainty. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are identified. The reasoning in each report aligns with the evidence, and the scores are consistent with the lack of concrete data. The only potential concern is the speculative mention of data flows in some reports, but without code, these remain hypotheses. Overall, the assessments are cautious and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code and assign low or zero risk scores. The evaluations are consistent and justified given the available information. No adjustments are necessary; the scores accurately reflect the lack of evidence for malicious activity or obfuscation.",
