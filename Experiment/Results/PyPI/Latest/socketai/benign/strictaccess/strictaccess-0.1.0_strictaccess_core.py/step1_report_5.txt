  "purpose": "Implement access control for class attributes, enforcing private and protected member access restrictions.",
  "sources": "Reads class attribute names, calls to __getattribute__, inspect.stack() for call stack inspection.",
  "sinks": "Raises exceptions on access violations, prints debug messages if enabled.",
  "flows": "Accessing an attribute -> __getattribute__ checks name and caller -> potential violation triggers -> exceptions or debug prints.",
  "anomalies": "Use of inspect.stack() to determine caller context; no external data input or network activity; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; no file or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a mixin class to enforce private/protected access control using attribute name conventions and inspection of the call stack. It raises specific exceptions for violations unless debug mode is enabled, in which case it prints debug info. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious actions are present. The code's logic is straightforward and intended for access restrictions within Python classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard access control pattern with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It relies on naming conventions and runtime inspection to restrict access, which is typical for such mechanisms. No malware or security risks detected.",
