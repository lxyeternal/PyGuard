{
  "purpose": "This code implements an access control mechanism for class attributes, enforcing private and protected member access restrictions, and raising exceptions or printing debug messages upon violations.",
  "sources": "Reads attribute names via __getattribute__ and inspect.stack() to determine caller context.",
  "sinks": "Potentially raises PrivateAccessError and ProtectedAccessError, which could be misused if not properly handled by consuming code. Uses print statements for debugging.",
  "flows": "Access to class attributes triggers __getattribute__, which checks attribute name and caller context, then may raise exceptions or print debug info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of inspect.stack() to determine caller context could be exploited or produce unreliable results; debug mode printing can leak information if enabled in production. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code enforces access control by inspecting attribute names and caller context, raising exceptions on violations. It uses inspect.stack() to identify caller objects, which can be unreliable or manipulated. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed. Debug mode printing could leak information but is conditional. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides a standard access control mixin with potential for misuse if debug mode is enabled, but no malicious intent or behavior identified. It appears to be a legitimate security control mechanism without malicious features.",
