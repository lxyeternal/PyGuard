  "purpose": "Implement access control mechanisms for class members, enforcing private and protected access levels.",
  "sources": "Class attributes accessed via __getattribute__, inspect.stack() for caller context, attribute values with '_access_level' property.",
  "sinks": "Violation handling in _handle_violation method, raising exceptions or printing debug info.",
  "flows": "Attribute access (source) triggers __getattribute__, which calls _handle_violation if access rules are violated.",
  "anomalies": "Use of inspect.stack() for caller verification is uncommon and could potentially be manipulated; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code found.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a mixin for attribute access control, raising exceptions for private/protected violations or printing debug info based on _debug_mode. It relies on inspect.stack() to verify caller context, which is a known pattern for access control but can be manipulated if an attacker controls the call stack. No external data input, network activity, or suspicious code (e.g., data exfiltration, command execution) is present. The code appears to implement a security feature rather than malicious behavior or malware. No obfuscation detected, and no malicious intent evident. It’s a standard pattern for enforcing access levels within classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a non-malicious access control mechanism for class attributes. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The use of inspect.stack() is typical for caller verification, not suspicious in this context. Overall, the code appears safe and primarily aimed at encapsulation/security within class design.",
