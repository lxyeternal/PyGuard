  "conclusion": "The code is a non-malicious access control mixin with limitations due to reliance on inspect.stack(). No evidence of malware or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to debug info leakage and potential unreliability of caller verification. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
