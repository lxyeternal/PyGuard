  "purpose": "Implement access control for class attributes and methods, enforcing private and protected access restrictions.",
  "sources": "Reads attribute names via __getattribute__, inspects call stack for caller context.",
  "sinks": "Raises exceptions on access violations, prints debug info when in debug mode.",
  "flows": "Accessing attributes (source) triggers __getattribute__, which checks for access level and may raise exceptions or print debug info (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Uses inspect.stack() to determine caller context for protected attribute access; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious external inputs. No hidden or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code enforces access control by raising custom exceptions or printing debug info based on attribute naming conventions and custom '_access_level' attributes. It inspects the call stack to verify if the caller is authorized for protected members. No malicious behavior or sabotage apparent. The use of inspect.stack() for access control checks is unconventional but not inherently malicious. No external network or data leakage observed.",
  "conclusion": "This module implements a straightforward access control mixin for class attributes, raising exceptions or printing debug messages on violations. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware indicators. The code appears intentional and safe, serving its purpose of access restriction.",
