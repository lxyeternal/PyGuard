{
  "purpose": "Implements an access control mixin that restricts access to private and protected class attributes based on naming conventions, caller context, and an optional access level attribute.",
  "sources": "Attribute access via __getattribute__, caller identification via inspect.stack(), checks on attribute names and _access_level",
  "sinks": "Raising exceptions for access violations, debug print statements (if enabled)",
  "flows": "Attribute access triggers __getattribute__, which inspects caller via inspect.stack(), then either returns value or raises exception / prints debug info",
  "anomalies": "Use of inspect.stack() for caller verification, debug print statements controlled by _debug_mode",
  "analysis": "The code enforces attribute privacy using naming conventions and caller inspection. It relies on inspect.stack(), which can be unreliable or manipulated, but does not introduce malicious behavior. No obfuscation or malicious code detected. Debug prints could leak info if enabled. Overall, the mechanism is a runtime access control pattern with known limitations, not a security vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-malicious access control mixin with limitations due to reliance on inspect.stack(). No evidence of malware or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to debug info leakage and potential unreliability of caller verification. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
