  "purpose": "Implement access control for class members, restricting private and protected attribute access and method calls.",
  "sources": "Attribute access via __getattribute__, inspect.stack() to determine caller context.",
  "sinks": "Potential exceptions raised on access violations, debug print statements.",
  "flows": "Attribute access → inspection of caller context → violation handling (exceptions or debug prints).",
  "anomalies": "Use of inspect.stack() for caller verification, which could be exploited for denial of service or performance issues but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code enforces access restrictions based on naming conventions and custom attributes. It uses inspect.stack() to verify caller context, raising custom exceptions or printing debug info upon violations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity are present. The code functions as an access control mechanism without harmful intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides an access control mechanism for class attributes, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard techniques and does not perform any harmful actions. No malicious behavior detected.",
