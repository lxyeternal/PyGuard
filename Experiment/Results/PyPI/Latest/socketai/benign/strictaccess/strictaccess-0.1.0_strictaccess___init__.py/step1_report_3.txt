  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.decorators, .access_tags).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Imports are straightforward; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports decorators and access control tags from local modules and defines the __all__ list for exports. It is a typical module initialization pattern with no apparent malicious intent. The code structure is simple and standard. No indications of malicious code, backdoors, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as an interface for exporting decorators and access tags. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
