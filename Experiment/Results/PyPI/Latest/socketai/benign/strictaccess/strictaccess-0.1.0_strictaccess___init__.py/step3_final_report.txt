  "purpose": "Re-export access control decorators and tags from local modules for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from .decorators and .access_tags modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; purely static re-export",
  "flows": "Import from local modules → assign to __all__ for export",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific symbols from local modules and re-exports them via __all__, serving as a module interface. No runtime logic, data handling, or external communication is present. The code is standard and benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning high confidence (1) and zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The structure and purpose are clear, and no anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign module for exporting access control decorators and tags. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
