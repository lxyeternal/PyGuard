{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a module that re-exports specific decorators and access tags for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .decorators and .access_tags",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from external inputs to critical sinks; mainly static import and export of identifiers",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward and standard for Python module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific elements from local modules and exposes them via __all__, which controls what is exported when the module is imported. There are no runtime operations, network calls, or data manipulations. The code structure and content are typical for module organization, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python module component responsible for re-exporting decorators and access tags. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security issues.",
