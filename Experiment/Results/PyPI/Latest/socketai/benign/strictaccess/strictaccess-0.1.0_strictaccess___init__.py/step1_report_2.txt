  "purpose": "Define and expose access control decorators and tags for use in other modules",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .decorators and .access_tags",
  "sinks": "None; no data or untrusted input handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and declares __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific objects from local modules and defines __all__ for module exports. It does not execute any logic, handle input, or perform any operations that could pose security risks. It appears to be a straightforward module setup for access control, with no malicious behavior or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely defining and exporting access control decorators/tags without any malicious intent or security risks.",
