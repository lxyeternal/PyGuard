  "purpose": "Defines exports for access control decorators and tags for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .decorators and .access_tags",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external outputs observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code only exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to only re-export imported symbols without additional logic; no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious indicators",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific symbols from local modules and re-exports them via __all__, which is a standard practice for managing public API. No dynamic code execution, input reading, or network activity. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving as an interface module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple re-export module with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
