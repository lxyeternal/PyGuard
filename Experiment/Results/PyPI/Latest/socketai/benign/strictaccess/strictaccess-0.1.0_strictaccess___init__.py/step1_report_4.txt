  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for access control decorators and tags, likely used to manage access permissions within a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: .decorators and .access_tags",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external communication occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code does not process data flows or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports specific functions and tags and declares them for export. There is no execution of untrusted input, dynamic code, or malicious behavior. It appears to be a straightforward module definition for access controls. No signs of malware, data leaks, or security risks are evident from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign module that exports access control utilities. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security issues.",
