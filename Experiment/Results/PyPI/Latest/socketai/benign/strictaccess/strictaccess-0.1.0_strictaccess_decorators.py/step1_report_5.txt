{
  "purpose": "Defines a decorator for adding strict access control behavior to classes, potentially for security enforcement.",
  "sources": "Importing AccessControlMixin from the same package/module",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data or untrusted input handling or external data flow present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only defines class wrapping",
  "anomalies": "Uses class inheritance to wrap and modify class behavior, but no unusual or suspicious patterns are present",
  "analysis": "The code creates a decorator that, when applied to a class, dynamically creates a new class inheriting from AccessControlMixin and the original class. It sets a debug mode attribute and preserves the original class's name and documentation. This pattern is typical for adding security features such as access control. No malicious behavior, code injection, data leakage, or backdoors are evident. The code does not perform any network operations, file access, or sensitive data handling. It is a straightforward class wrapper intended for security enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement a class decorator for access control purposes without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code, and its functionality aligns with standard security enforcement patterns.",
