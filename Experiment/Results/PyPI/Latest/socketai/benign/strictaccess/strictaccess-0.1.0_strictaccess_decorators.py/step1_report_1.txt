{
  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator function for wrapping classes with access control behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'debug' parameter from the function argument and class attributes (__name__, __doc__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'debug' is assigned to class attribute '_debug_mode' in the wrapped class; no other flows or external data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior; the code uses class wrapping to augment access control, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class, defines a decorator that wraps any class with an AccessControlMixin, and copies some class attributes. It sets a debug mode attribute. There are no external data sources, no data sinks, and no suspicious code. The overall pattern appears to be a straightforward class decorator to add access control features without any malicious or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate class decorator for adding access control features. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks. The code structure and content are typical for such functionality.",
