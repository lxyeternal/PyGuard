{
  "purpose": "Defines a decorator function to wrap classes with access control functionality, potentially for security purposes.",
  "sources": "Input source is the decorator parameter and class attributes; the code imports from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data is written to external systems or files, nor executed dynamically.",
  "flows": "Decorator applied to a class, creating a new class inheriting from AccessControlMixin and the original class, with modifications to attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a class decorator that enhances classes with access control behavior by inheritance. It sets a debug mode attribute and preserves class name and docstring. No input/output or external calls are present. The import is from a local module, which is standard. There is no indication of malicious intent or malicious code functionality. The code is straightforward and standard for adding mixins.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility to add access control features via class inheritance. No malware or security risks are evident.",
