  "purpose": "A class decorator that wraps a class with access control functionality by inheriting from AccessControlMixin.",
  "sources": "Import from local module .core, class parameter in decorator.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Decorator creates a new class inheriting from AccessControlMixin and the original class, setting attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward class decorator that adds access control via multiple inheritance. It imports a mixin, wraps the class, and sets a debug attribute, preserving class name and docstring. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, with a very low security risk score (~0.1). The code's simplicity and clarity support these assessments. No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign class decorator for access control, with no malicious intent or security risks. All evaluations are consistent and accurate.",
