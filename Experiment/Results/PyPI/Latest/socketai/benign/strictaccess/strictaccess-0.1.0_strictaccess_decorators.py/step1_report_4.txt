{
  "purpose": "Defines a decorator for wrapping classes with access control functionality, enabling debug mode configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module .core, specifically AccessControlMixin.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily class inheritance and attribute assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code constructs. The dynamic class creation is straightforward and appears intentional.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a mixin class, then defines a decorator function that wraps a given class with a new class inheriting from both AccessControlMixin and the original class. It sets a debug mode attribute and copies the class name and documentation. There are no external data inputs, no network calls, and no suspicious logic or obfuscated code. The pattern appears to be a standard class decorator for adding access control features with optional debugging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of a class decorator to add access control capabilities and debugging options. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It appears safe and straightforward.",
