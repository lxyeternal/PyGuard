  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for access control errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; classes are defined statically.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; exception classes are for internal control flow only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class definitions with docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, intended for access control errors related to private and protected attribute access. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no external data handling are present. The implementation appears standard and benign, focused solely on exception handling structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard implementation of custom exception classes for access control. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears safe and purposeful for defining specific exceptions.",
