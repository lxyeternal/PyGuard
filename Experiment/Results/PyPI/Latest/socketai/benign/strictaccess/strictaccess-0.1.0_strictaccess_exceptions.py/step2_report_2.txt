  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining three custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`, with descriptive docstrings.\n- The code is static, with no external data, network operations, or dynamic behavior.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are reported.\n- The conclusion in each report is that the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n\n**Confirming the code:**\n- The original code matches the descriptions: three classes (`AccessControlError`, `PrivateAccessError`, `ProtectedAccessError`) with straightforward inheritance and docstrings.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Error or flaws in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign and straightforward.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n- The scores assigned (`malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`) are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct since there's no malicious activity.\n- The security risk score is 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- The confidence level is 1, indicating certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- Since all reports assign scores of 0 for malware and security risk, and the code is straightforward class definitions, there's no reason to justify higher scores.\n- The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious or risky.\n\n**Potential assumptions:**\n- The reports assume that defining exception classes is inherently safe, which is valid.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made; the analysis is appropriate.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- All scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is purely defining exception classes with no dynamic or external behavior.\n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exceptions for access control. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall security posture based on this code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation concerns.",
