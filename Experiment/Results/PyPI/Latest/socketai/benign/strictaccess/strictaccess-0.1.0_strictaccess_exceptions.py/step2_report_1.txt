  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions related to access control. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, external data handling, or other malicious behaviors. The code is static, simple, and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent. There are no logical errors or misinterpretations evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - malware: 0\n   - securityRisk: 0  \n   These seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code. Since the code only defines exception classes with no external interactions, these scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   No report assigns a risk score above 0. Given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators, this is justified.\n\n5. **Malware score reflection:**  \n   All reports correctly assign malware = 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they do not speculate about hidden malicious behavior, which is appropriate.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — The code is purely class definitions with no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — No security risk is present.\n\n### Final conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for access control. All reports are accurate and consistent. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the current scores.**",
