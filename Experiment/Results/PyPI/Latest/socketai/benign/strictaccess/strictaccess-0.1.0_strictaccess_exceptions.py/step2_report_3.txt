  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n1. **Code Confirmation:**\n- The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`, with no additional logic or data.\n- No dynamic code, external data, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The classes are straightforward and serve as specific exceptions for access control.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code matches the description in all reports. No issues are present.\n\n---\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- All reports uniformly describe the code as benign, straightforward, and standard.\n- They correctly identify that there are no data flows, no external inputs, and no malicious behavior.\n- No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident in the reports.\n\n**Note:** The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n3. **Scores Review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n\n- These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- Since there's no malicious activity, the malware score should remain 0.\n- The security risk is correctly low, as the code is just class definitions.\n- Obfuscation is not present; the code is straightforward.\n\n**Suggestion:** The scores are reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n---\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a high risk.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could lead to security issues.\n- The risk score is correctly 0 for all reports.\n\n---\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n- No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code are present.\n- The code only defines exception classes.\n\n**Conclusion:** The malware score is justified as 0.\n\n---\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n---\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The confidence level of 1 reflects certainty about the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions for access control, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, consistent, and appropriately score the code as benign. No changes are necessary.",
