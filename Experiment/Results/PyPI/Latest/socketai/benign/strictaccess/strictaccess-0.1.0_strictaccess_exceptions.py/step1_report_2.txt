  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for access control violations.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; exception classes are static definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are simple exception definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with clear docstrings. There are no inputs, outputs, or data processing. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code appears to serve as part of an access control system, possibly for enforcing attribute privacy in a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of simple, standard class definitions for access control exceptions. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It appears to be a benign and conventional implementation of custom exceptions.",
