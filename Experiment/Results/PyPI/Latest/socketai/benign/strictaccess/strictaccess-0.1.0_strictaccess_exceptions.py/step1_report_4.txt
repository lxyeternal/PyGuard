  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for access control errors related to private and protected attribute access in Python.",
  "sources": "Exception class definitions; no external data input.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only class and exception definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. It includes descriptive docstrings. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The structure is simple and standard for defining custom exceptions related to access control. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, benign set of custom exception classes intended for access control handling. No malicious behavior or security concerns are present.",
