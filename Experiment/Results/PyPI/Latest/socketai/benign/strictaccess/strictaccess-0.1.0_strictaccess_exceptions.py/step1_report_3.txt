  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for access control violations",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present in the code",
  "sinks": "No data or actions that could leak or cause security effects",
  "flows": "No data flows; solely class definitions and inheritance",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures present",
  "analysis": "The code only defines three custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception and a base custom class. There are no data input, network operations, or other behaviors that could be exploited or malicious. The class hierarchy appears standard for implementing access control error handling. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward class definitions intended for use in access control exception handling. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
