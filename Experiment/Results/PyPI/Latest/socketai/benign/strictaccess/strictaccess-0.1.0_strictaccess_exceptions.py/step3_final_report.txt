  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for access control errors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions of AccessControlError, PrivateAccessError, ProtectedAccessError inheriting from Exception.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static class definitions with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions related to access control, with descriptive docstrings. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data interactions, or malicious constructs. The code is static, simple, and standard. No anomalies or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence score of 1 reflects certainty in the benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for access control. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
