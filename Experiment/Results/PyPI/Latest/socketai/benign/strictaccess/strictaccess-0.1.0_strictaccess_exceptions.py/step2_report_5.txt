  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports consistently state that the code only defines three custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with descriptive docstrings. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, external data handling, or other suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and static.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code does not contain any issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior. It is a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic or Reasoning**  \nThe reports uniformly conclude that the code is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent. Given the simplicity of the code, these assessments are accurate. There are no logical flaws or misinterpretations.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- confidence: 1\n- obfuscated: 0\n- malware: 0\n- securityRisk: 0\n\nThese scores are consistent with the analysis, as the code is benign.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports agree that there is no malware, obfuscation, or security risk, raising the risk scores above 0.5 would be unjustified. The code is purely definitional, with no suspicious activity.\n\n5. **Malware Score and Malicious Behavior**  \nAll reports assign malware score = 0, which aligns with the code content. No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports are cautious and avoid assumptions beyond the code's scope. They correctly identify the code as standard class definitions.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \nScores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct, no security risk)\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\nThe code is a simple, benign set of custom exception classes for access control, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' conclusions are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security threat. The reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
