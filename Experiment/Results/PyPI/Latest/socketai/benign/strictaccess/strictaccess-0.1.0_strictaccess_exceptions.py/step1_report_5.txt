  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for access control violations such as private and protected attribute access errors.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources used in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class, intended for access control error handling. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external interactions, and no complex logic. The classes are simple, well-structured, and serve as specific exception types for access violations. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be part of an access control module, defining error types, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of exception class definitions intended for access control error handling. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is standard and safe.",
