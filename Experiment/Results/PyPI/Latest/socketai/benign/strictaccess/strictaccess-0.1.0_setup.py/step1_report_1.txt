{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for the 'strictaccess' Python package, including metadata and package discovery settings.",
  "sources": "The code reads the long description from 'README.md' using open('README.md').read().",
  "sinks": "The open() function reads external file content; no untrusted data sources or security-sensitive sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the file 'README.md' into the long_description parameter of setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration script for Python packaging. It imports setuptools, specifies package metadata, reads a README file for the long description, and configures package discovery and requirements. No user input, network operations, or execution of untrusted code occurs. There are no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal, benign setup configuration script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
