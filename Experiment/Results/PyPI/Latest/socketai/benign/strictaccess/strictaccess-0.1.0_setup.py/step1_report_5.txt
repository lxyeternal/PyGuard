  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'strictaccess' Python package, including metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Reading the README file as part of package setup; no data flows to sinks that cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read 'README.md' is standard for package descriptions; no unusual code or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. The only file read operation is for the long description, which is common practice. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or hardcoded secrets, is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
