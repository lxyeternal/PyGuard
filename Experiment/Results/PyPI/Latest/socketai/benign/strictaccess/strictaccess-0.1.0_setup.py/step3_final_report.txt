  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging the Python project 'strictaccess'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description; static package metadata defined in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Static data from 'README.md' flows into setup() parameters; no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() without explicit error handling, but this is typical in setup scripts; no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script that imports setuptools, reads a local README.md file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata. It contains no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The open() call is standard practice, though lacking error handling, but not a security concern. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. All signals point to benign, well-structured code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
