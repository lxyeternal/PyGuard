  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'strictaccess' Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata and description from static strings and files; usage of 'find_packages()' to locate packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no external data flows or outputs identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; setup configuration is static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed. The code adheres to standard setup script practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script utilizing setuptools for package distribution. It reads the long description from a local README.md file and specifies package metadata such as name, version, author, and license. There are no dynamic code executions, no external data inputs besides the static file read, and no suspicious code constructs or hidden behaviors. The script appears to serve its intended purpose without security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and typical for package distribution.",
