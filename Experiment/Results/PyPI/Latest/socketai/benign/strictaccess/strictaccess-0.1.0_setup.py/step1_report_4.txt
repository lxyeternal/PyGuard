  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'strictaccess' Python package, used to configure package metadata and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description content.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' to obtain long_description, then pass data to setup() for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of open() without explicit error handling could be considered unusual, but it is standard in setup scripts. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup functions from setuptools and calls setup() with package metadata. It reads a README.md file to include a long description. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code. No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors. The code is straightforward and typical for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious intent or security risks.",
