  "purpose": "Decorators to assign access level metadata to functions for organizational or access control purposes.",
  "sources": "Function definitions being decorated; no external data or input sources involved.",
  "sinks": "Attribute assignment to functions; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Decorator calls assign '_access_level' attribute to functions; no external data flow or malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with simple attribute assignment and no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three decorators that set an '_access_level' attribute on functions, serving as metadata tags. There are no input validations, external data handling, network operations, or code execution based on external input. The code is simple, clear, and intended for internal use within larger systems. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for annotating functions with access levels. There is no malicious intent, security risk, or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
