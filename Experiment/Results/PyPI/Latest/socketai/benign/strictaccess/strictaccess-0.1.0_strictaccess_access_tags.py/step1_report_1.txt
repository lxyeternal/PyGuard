  "purpose": "Define decorators to assign access level attributes to functions (private, protected, public).",
  "sources": "Function definitions and decorator applications.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to function attributes (_access_level).",
  "flows": "Function definition → decorator application → attribute assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code present. No unusual behavior or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements three simple decorators that annotate functions with an '_access_level' attribute indicating 'private', 'protected', or 'public'. These decorators merely set attributes on functions; no input validation, external data processing, or network activity occurs. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and intended for access control annotation within a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as simple decorators for access level tagging. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
