  "purpose": "Defines three decorators to assign access level attributes to functions: private, protected, and public.",
  "sources": "Function definitions for private, protected, and public decorators.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external calls.",
  "flows": "Decorators modify function objects by setting an attribute; no data flow from source to sink that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple decorators that assign an access level attribute to functions. There is no input/output handling, external communication, or malicious code. The decorators do not perform any security-sensitive operations or alter control flow in a way that could indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a labeling mechanism for functions' access levels. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
