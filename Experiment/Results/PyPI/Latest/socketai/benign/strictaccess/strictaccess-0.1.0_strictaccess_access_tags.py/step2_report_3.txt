  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same simple pattern: decorators that assign an `_access_level` attribute to functions.\n- The code is straightforward, with no input validation, external data handling, or network activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are observed.\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign.\n\n**Issue presence confirmation:**\n- The code snippets in all reports match the original code provided. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in the code.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify that the code is benign, simple, and intended for metadata annotation.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n- These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Risk score justification:**\n- Since all reports conclude no malicious activity, no security risks, and no obfuscation, the overall risk score should be very low, close to zero.\n\n**Malware score justification:**\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain any suspicious behavior. Malware score should remain at 0.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as harmless.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are made about hidden behaviors.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal concern, but effectively benign)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward implementation of decorators for metadata tagging, with no malicious or security risk implications. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Assign a very low security risk score (~0.1) to acknowledge the code's benign nature but to maintain cautiousness in security scoring systems.",
