  "purpose": "Defines decorators to set access level attributes on functions, likely for code organization or access control annotations.",
  "sources": "Function definitions and the setting of attributes within decorator functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; no data leaks or external effects evident.",
  "flows": "Decorators modify functions by adding attributes, no data flow involving untrusted sources or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides three decorators (private, protected, public) that assign an access level attribute to functions. These are standard Python patterns for adding metadata. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or malicious side effects. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for code annotation purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
