{
  "purpose": "The code defines three decorators to set access level attributes on functions: private, protected, and public.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed.",
  "targets": "No specific data sinks; the code only sets attributes on functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the decorators modify function attributes but do not process data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple decorators that annotate functions with access level attributes. It does not perform any input validation, data processing, or external communication. The functions only modify the passed-in function objects, which is typical for decorators. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of decorators for setting access level metadata on functions. No malicious or security risk behaviors are detected.",
