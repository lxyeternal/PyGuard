  "purpose": "Define decorators to set access level attributes on functions",
  "sources": "Function definitions, decorator functions",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Decorator functions modify function attributes without external data flow",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines three decorators: private, protected, and public, which assign an '_access_level' attribute to functions. These decorators are straightforward and only annotate functions with access level metadata. There is no input handling, no external data access, and no side effects or network operations. The code appears to be intended for code organization or access control annotations within a larger system. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident from these definitions. The simplicity and clarity of the code suggest it is not obfuscated or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides function decorators to assign access level attributes. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a harmless, structural utility for code organization.",
