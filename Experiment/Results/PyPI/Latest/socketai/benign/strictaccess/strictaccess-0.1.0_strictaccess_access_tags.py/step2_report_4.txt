  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code consists of three decorators (`private`, `protected`, `public`) that assign an `_access_level` attribute to functions.\n   - The decorators are straightforward: they set an attribute and return the function.\n   - There are no input validations, external data handling, network calls, or other side effects.\n   - The code appears to be a simple utility for tagging functions with access levels, likely for organizational or access control purposes within a larger system.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present.\n   - No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are observed.\n   - The decorators do not perform any operations beyond attribute assignment.\n   - No external data flows, untrusted data, or external calls are involved.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforwardness of the code.\n   - **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis that there are no security risks.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - The purpose of the code is purely for metadata annotation, not security enforcement.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is cautious and correct.\n\n5. **Suggestions for score adjustments:**\n   - The scores seem appropriate; no changes are necessary.\n   - Since the code is simple and harmless, scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are justified.\n\n6. **Overall conclusion:**\n   - The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final note:** The code is a harmless utility for function metadata tagging, with no security concerns.",
