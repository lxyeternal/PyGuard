  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code defines three simple decorators (`private`, `protected`, `public`) that assign an `_access_level` attribute to functions. The code is straightforward, with no input validation, external data access, or network activity.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Code or Obfuscation**:  \n   All reports explicitly state that no malicious behavior, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are detected. The code appears to serve as a metadata tagging utility within a larger codebase.\n\n3. **Flow & Data Handling**:  \n   The decorators only modify function objects by setting attributes. There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, no external communication, and no processing of sensitive data.\n\n4. **Risk & Malware Scores**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code. The security risk scores are also 0, which seems appropriate given the analysis.\n\n5. **Score Justification & Potential Adjustments**:  \n   - The reports' confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward implementation.\n   - The overall security risk is 0, which is reasonable.\n\n6. **Potential for Misinterpretation or Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify that the code is for annotation purposes and does not contain malicious logic.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Code correctness & purpose**: Confirmed as benign decorators for metadata tagging.\n- **Malware & obfuscation**: Correctly scored as 0.\n- **Security risk**: Correctly scored as 0.\n\n**My own estimate** after this review:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, simple, and intended for internal metadata annotation. No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation**:  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
