  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code consists solely of three decorators that assign an `_access_level` attribute to functions.\n   - There are no input validations, external data handling, network operations, or code execution based on external input.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present.\n   - The code is straightforward and intended for annotating functions within a larger codebase.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - They consistently note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in their assessments.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary; the scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign `securityRisk` and `malware` scores of 0, indicating no security threat, this is justified.\n   - The code does not perform any potentially dangerous operations.\n   - Therefore, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, such as executing arbitrary code, exfiltrating data, or performing network activities.\n   - The malware score of 0 across reports is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities.\n   - They focus on the code's actual behavior, which is benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is purely structural, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is benign, serving as simple decorators for access level annotation without any security concerns.",
