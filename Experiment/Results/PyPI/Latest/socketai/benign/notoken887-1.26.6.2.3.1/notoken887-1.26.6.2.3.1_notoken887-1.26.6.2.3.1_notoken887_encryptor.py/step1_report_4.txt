{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple substitution encryption and decryption of strings, replacing characters with emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "The input data is taken from method parameters 'string' for encrypt and 'encrypted_token' for decrypt.",
  "sinks": "The code only performs string replacements within the class methods; no external data sinks, network connections, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed character-by-character through replacement functions, converting plain text to emoji-based tokens and back.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses straightforward character substitution with no obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident. No external calls or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The class implements basic substitution ciphers with explicit emoji mappings. The encryption and decryption functions are symmetrical, relying solely on string replacement. There are no indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or backdoors. The methods are simple and deterministic, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of character substitution cipher using emojis. It poses no security risk or malicious behavior concerns based on the provided source code.",
