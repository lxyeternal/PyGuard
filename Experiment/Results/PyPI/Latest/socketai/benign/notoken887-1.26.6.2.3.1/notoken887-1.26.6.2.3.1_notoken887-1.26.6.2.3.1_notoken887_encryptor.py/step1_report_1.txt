{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple substitution cipher-based encryption and decryption for strings using emoji replacements.",
  "sources": "Input data is passed to the 'encrypt' method; encrypted data is processed by the 'decrypt' method.",
  "sinks": "The 'decrypt' method outputs the decrypted string; the 'encrypt' method outputs the encrypted string.",
  "flows": "Input string -> 'encrypt' method -> substituted emoji string -> 'decrypt' method -> original string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs straightforward substitution without external data sources or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a reversible substitution cipher by replacing alphabetic and some special characters with emojis in 'encrypt' and reversing the substitutions in 'decrypt'. There are no external data reads, network calls, or hidden behaviors. The methods are purely data transformation functions. No signs of malware, malicious data leaks, or malicious behavior are detected. The code is simple and transparent, with no obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a substitution cipher for strings, with no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks.",
