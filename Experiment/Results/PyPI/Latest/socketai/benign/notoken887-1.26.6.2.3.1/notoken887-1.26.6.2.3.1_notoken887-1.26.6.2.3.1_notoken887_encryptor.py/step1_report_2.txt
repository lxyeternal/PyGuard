{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple substitution-based encoding and decoding of strings, likely for obfuscation or basic token transformation.",
  "sources": "Methods encrypt() and decrypt() which read input strings and perform character replacements.",
  "sinks": "The replacement functions could potentially be used to hide malicious payloads or data within obfuscated strings, but the code itself does not process external untrusted input sources directly.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace() substitutions in encrypt() -> output encrypted string; Encrypted string -> replace() substitutions in decrypt() -> output original string.",
  "anomalies": "The code is solely performing character replacements with emojis and special characters. No external inputs, environment variables, network operations, or data leaks are present. No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscation techniques beyond substitution. No suspicious functions or code execution logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward substitution cipher using emojis and symbols for characters. There are no dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling. The design is simple and transparent, with no signs of malicious intent. It appears to be intended for basic obfuscation or encoding purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign implementation of character substitution encoding and decoding. No malicious signals or malware indicators are present.",
