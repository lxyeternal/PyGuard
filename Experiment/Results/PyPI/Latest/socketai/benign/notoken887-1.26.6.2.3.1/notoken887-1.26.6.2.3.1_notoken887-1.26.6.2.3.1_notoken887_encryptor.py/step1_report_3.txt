  "purpose": "The class TokenCryptor provides simple character replacement-based obfuscation and de-obfuscation methods for strings.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the encrypt() and decrypt() methods",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable if used to obfuscate malicious data or tokens, but no direct data leaks or external communications are present",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace characters with symbols in encrypt() -> reverse replacements in decrypt()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward character substitution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a symmetric simple substitution cipher for obfuscating and de-obfuscating text via character replacements. The implementation is symmetric, with each character mapped to a unique symbol in both encrypt() and decrypt() functions. The code does not include any network communication, system modification, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No obfuscated or hidden malicious code is present. The approach is trivial and easily reversible, which indicates it is for simple obfuscation rather than security. There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, code injection, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of character substitution for obfuscation purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks, serving only to encode and decode strings using predefined mappings.",
