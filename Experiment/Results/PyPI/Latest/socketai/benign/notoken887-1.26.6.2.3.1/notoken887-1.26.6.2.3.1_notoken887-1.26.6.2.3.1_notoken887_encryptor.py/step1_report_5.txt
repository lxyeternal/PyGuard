{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple substitution cipher-based methods for encoding and decoding strings using emoji replacements.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings through the encrypt() method and encrypted tokens via the decrypt() method.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, files, or network; it only transforms strings within memory.",
  "flows": "Input string → encrypt() (substitution) → output encrypted string; encrypted string → decrypt() (reverse substitution) → output original string.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses extensive string replacements without any validation, cryptographic security, or key management. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code is present. The class does not perform any malicious actions like network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification.",
  "analysis": "The implementation employs straightforward character substitution with emojis for obfuscation. Both encrypt() and decrypt() functions rely on static replacement mappings. No external dependencies or inputs are involved beyond string transformations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as malicious network activity, data theft, or backdoor access. The design is simple and transparent, aimed at reversible string encoding, which is not secure cryptography but also not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic reversible substitution cipher using emojis. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks evident. It appears to be a benign encoding utility with no harmful intent.",
