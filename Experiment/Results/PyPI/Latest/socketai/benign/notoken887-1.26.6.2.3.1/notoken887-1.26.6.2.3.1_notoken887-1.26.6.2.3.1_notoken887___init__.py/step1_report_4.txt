  "purpose": "The code appears to set up some configuration or perform an operation related to data processing, but without specific comments or documentation, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, importing modules, potentially reading from files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writing to files, sending data over network connections, executing system commands, or interacting with system resources.",
  "flows": "Data from sources such as environment variables or input functions may flow into processing functions, then to sinks such as network transmission or file output.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets detected; the code structure appears straightforward. No obfuscated code, uncommon language features, or misleading variable names are evident. However, without full code, some parts may be missing.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and lacks explicit malicious constructs such as network calls to suspicious domains, reverse shells, or data exfiltration methods. The absence of detailed code limits the assessment, but based on available information, there are no signs of malicious behavior. The structure and usage seem standard, with no suspicious loops or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear indicators of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The code appears benign, but incomplete information limits absolute certainty. No malicious intent or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
