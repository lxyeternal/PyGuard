  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on code patterns such as eval usage, obfuscation, network activity, and data leaks.",
  "sources": "Input functions (e.g., input()), environment variables, network calls, file reads, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "eval() or exec() calls, network transmissions, environment variable access, file modifications, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources like user input or environment variables flow into eval/exec or network functions, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval(input()) without sanitization, high obfuscation scores, suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution patterns.",
  "analysis": "Reports 1 and 3 show suspicious patterns: report 1 indicates obfuscation and network activity with scores 0.6 and 0.7 respectively; report 3 highlights eval(input()) with high malware (0.8) and security risk (0.9). Reports 2, 4, and 5 lack code or show benign patterns, with zero scores. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors. The high malware and risk scores in reports 1 and 3 are justified by the presence of obfuscation and dangerous eval usage. Overall, the suspicion levels and scores align with standard security assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits high suspicion in reports 1 and 3 due to obfuscation and eval usage, indicating potential malicious intent with high malware and risk scores. Other reports are benign or lack sufficient data, justifying low scores. The overall assessment suggests caution, especially regarding eval-based code, with a combined malware score around 0.75, obfuscation around 0.4, and risk around 0.75.",
