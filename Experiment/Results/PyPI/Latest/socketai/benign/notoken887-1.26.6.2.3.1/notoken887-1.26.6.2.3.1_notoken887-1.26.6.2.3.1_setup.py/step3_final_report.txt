  "purpose": "Standard package setup script defining package metadata without dynamic or malicious code.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields: name, version, author, author_email, description, url, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or external inputs processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks due to static nature.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org') as unprofessional or provocative metadata; no code obfuscation or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with static metadata. No dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected. The suspicious metadata (author email and URL) could be indicators of trolling or social engineering but do not constitute active malicious code. All reports correctly identify the static nature and lack of malicious content. Malware scores are appropriately zero; obfuscation scores are zero; risk scores are low (~0.2-0.3), reflecting metadata concerns but no active threats. The overall assessment confirms the code is benign, with metadata issues not translating into security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with suspicious but non-malicious metadata. No active malware or obfuscation is present. The assigned scores are appropriate, with a low security risk primarily due to metadata concerns. No modifications are necessary.",
