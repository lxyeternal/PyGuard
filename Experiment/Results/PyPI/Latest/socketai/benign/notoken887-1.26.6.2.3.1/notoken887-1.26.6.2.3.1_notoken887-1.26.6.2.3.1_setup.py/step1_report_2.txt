  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python library named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() function, such as package name, version, author info, description, URL, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or where untrusted input could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static inputs into the setup() function, with no user input or external data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of suspicious author email 'hitler@gmail.com' and URL 'https://thugging.org', which are unprofessional and potentially malicious or intentionally provocative. The description 'my obfuscation test lib' could suggest an attempt at hiding or obfuscating intent, but no actual obfuscation is present in code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script with hardcoded package metadata. The author email and URL are unconventional and suspicious, potentially indicating malicious intent or at least unprofessional conduct. No code injection, dynamic execution, or malicious behavior is detected. The package content appears benign from this snippet, but the suspicious metadata warrants caution. No obfuscation or malware-like activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script itself is a typical setup configuration with some suspicious metadata (author email and URL). There is no malicious code or obfuscation present; however, the unconventional contact details may suggest malicious or provocative intent, but this does not constitute active malware or security risk within this code snippet.",
