  "purpose": "This is a metadata manifest file for an Odoo module called 'Budget Activity - Purchase'. It specifies module details, dependencies, data files, and configuration settings.",
  "sources": "Static JSON-like data block containing module information, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic data inputs or outputs, no external data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration data without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code. Standard metadata structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module manifest for an Odoo application. It contains static strings and lists describing the module's attributes, dependencies, and files. There are no apparent code injections, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The data appears legitimate and consistent with typical module manifests. No suspicious patterns, external calls, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Odoo module manifest with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
