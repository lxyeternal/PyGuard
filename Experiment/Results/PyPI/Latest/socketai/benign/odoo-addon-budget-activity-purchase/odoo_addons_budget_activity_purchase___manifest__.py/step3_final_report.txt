  "purpose": "Static manifest/configuration for an Odoo module, defining metadata, dependencies, and data files.",
  "sources": "Module metadata fields such as name, version, depends, data, maintainers, etc.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no input/output processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward JSON-like manifest with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static manifest for an Odoo module, containing only metadata and references to XML views. It does not include executable code, input handling, network calls, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign, declarative nature. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are consistently zero, justified by the absence of malicious or suspicious content. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the static and transparent structure. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Odoo module manifest with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent; no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
