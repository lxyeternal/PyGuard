  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as a minimal Python module, including a license comment and an import statement for a local module named 'purchase'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the license comment and the import statement; no external inputs or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects, as the code only performs a straightforward import.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to the import statement from the local package; no data flows or external communications are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is clear and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license comment and an import statement from a local module, typical for Python packages. No data input, output, network activity, or malicious constructs are present. The import is from a local package, which is standard and not suspicious. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The assigned malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious intent. The security risk score is also 0, indicating no security concern. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
