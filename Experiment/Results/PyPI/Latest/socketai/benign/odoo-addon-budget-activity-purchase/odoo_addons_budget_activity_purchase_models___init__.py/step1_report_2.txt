  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths since the code only contains an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code; the only notable element is the import of a local module. No suspicious or unusual code structures, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports a local module named 'purchase'. It includes only a license comment and an import statement. No user input handling, no external data processing, and no suspicious activity detected. The import appears to be straightforward and within normal project scope.",
