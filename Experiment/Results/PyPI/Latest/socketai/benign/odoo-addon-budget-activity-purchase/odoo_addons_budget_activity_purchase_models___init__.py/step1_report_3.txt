{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module license declaration and an import statement for a purchase module, likely part of a larger Python package.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the import statement importing the 'purchase' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; no untrusted data handling or effects are observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident since the code only declares a license and imports a module without further logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard, with no unusual or suspicious patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The file only contains a license comment and an import statement, which are typical in Python modules. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behaviors. The import could be part of a legitimate package structure. No external data sources or sensitive data handling are involved. There are no code execution, network activity, or credential management indications.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited content, the code appears benign and is typical of a Python module setup. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
