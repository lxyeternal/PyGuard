{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'purchase' within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local package",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow is present in the provided snippet",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no suspicious or unusual constructs; only a license comment and import statement",
  "analysis": "The code includes a license comment indicating AGPL-3.0 licensing. It then imports a module named 'purchase' from the current package. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or other operations that could be malicious or indicate malicious intent. The import could be part of standard package structure. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal, benign code snippet with no evidence of malicious behavior. It simply states licensing information and imports a local module, which is common in Python packages.",
