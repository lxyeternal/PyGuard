  "purpose": "Importing models module from the current package, likely for application logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "The import statement from the local package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths observed.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only an import statement; no suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a license comment and a single import statement. The license is open-source (AGPL-3.0), and the import is a standard Python practice for modular code. No untrusted data sources, no sinks, and no logic that could be exploited. The code is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is a typical import statement in a Python module, with no malicious intent detected.",
