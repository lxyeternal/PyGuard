  "purpose": "Minimal Python module with a license comment and a relative import, typical for package initialization.",
  "sources": "License comment and the relative import statement (`from . import models`).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import and comment only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code is static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, containing only a license comment and a standard relative import. No dynamic code, data input/output, or network activity. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0. The code's simplicity and standard structure do not suggest malicious intent or security risks. The scores are consistent with the code's content, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
