  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets licensing and imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a license comment and an import statement. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or network communications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity. The import of 'models' appears standard for modular Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to specify licensing and import a module. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
