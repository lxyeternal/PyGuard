{
  "purpose": "The code specifies the license for a Python package and imports the 'models' module from the current package.",
  "sources": "The license declaration does not read any data; the import statement reads the 'models' module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or potential data leak points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or output in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual elements, code obfuscation, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license comment and an import statement. The license declaration is a standard open-source license notice. The import statement is a typical way to include modules in Python. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden code, or security issues. Given the simplicity and the nature of the code, it does not contain any malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to specify licensing and to import a module. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security concerns.",
