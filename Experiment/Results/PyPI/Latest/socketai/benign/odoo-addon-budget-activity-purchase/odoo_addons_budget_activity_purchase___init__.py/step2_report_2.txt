  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple license comment plus a relative import of a local module named 'models'.\n- The code is minimal, with no data flows, no input/output, no dynamic code, and no suspicious constructs.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which seems appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The code contains only a license comment and an import statement. No anomalies, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** Correctly scored as 0.\n- **Security risk:** Properly scored as 0, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Critical points:\n- The reasoning in all reports is consistent and accurate.\n- The scores seem reasonable and justified.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities that are not supported by the code snippet.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Since the code is a typical package import with a license comment, the risk and malware scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence level of 1 is appropriate, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- No modifications needed; the reports are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in all reports are justified and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's simplicity and benign nature. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
