{
  "purpose": "The code appears to specify a license and import a module named 'models'.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from . import models' indicates reading from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the import is static.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; the only notable aspect is the license declaration and a relative import. No obfuscated or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code specifies the AGPL-3.0 license, which is a common open-source license. The only functional line imports a local module named 'models'. This is typical in Python packages and does not indicate malicious intent. There are no data inputs, outputs, or code execution patterns that suggest malicious behavior. The minimal code does not include any dynamic code, user input handling, or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard licensing comment and a straightforward import statement with no malicious behavior detected. It appears to be part of a larger project structure. No security issues are evident in this snippet.",
