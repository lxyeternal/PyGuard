  "purpose": "Extends the purchase.order.line model in Odoo to include activity_id information in account move lines and to retrieve associated account data.",
  "sources": "self.activity_id, self.activity_id.id, self.activity_id.account_id",
  "sinks": "res['activity_id'], return statements, super() method calls",
  "flows": "Reading self.activity_id -> setting res['activity_id'] -> returning account data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of super() and standard model methods appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code extends an Odoo model to add and retrieve activity-related data in purchase order lines. It uses standard Odoo practices, with no evidence of malicious code or data exfiltration. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or obfuscated code detected. The code appears clean, functional, and secure within its scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward extension of an Odoo model with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It follows typical practices for adding custom fields and retrieving related data. No malware or security risks identified.",
