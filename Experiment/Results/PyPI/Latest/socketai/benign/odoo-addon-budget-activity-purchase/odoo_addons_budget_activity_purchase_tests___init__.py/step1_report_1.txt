  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; import is static",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code structure, no anomalies detected; only a single import statement",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module with a license comment and an import statement. There is no evidence of data input, output, or suspicious behavior. The import appears to be a standard practice for including local modules, and there are no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The license comment is standard and does not affect security.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports a module, which is typical in Python packages.",
