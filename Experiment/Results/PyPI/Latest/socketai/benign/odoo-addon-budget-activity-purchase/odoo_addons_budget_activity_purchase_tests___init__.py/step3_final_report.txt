{
  "purpose": "Minimal Python module with a license comment and a local import, likely for testing or development purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from . import test_budget_activity_purchase' as it reads a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external data sinks; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow or execution flow beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a test module import, which is common in development but could be misused if included in production; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is extremely simple, consisting of a license comment and a single relative import. No dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation. The import of 'test_budget_activity_purchase' suggests a testing or development context. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The malware score is appropriately zero, as there is no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is zero, given the straightforward syntax. The security risk score is very low (~0.0 to 0.1), mainly due to the inclusion of a test module, which is typical in development but should be reviewed if found in production. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is simple and well-understood.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The inclusion of a test module is common during development and does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
