{
  "purpose": "Import statement for the 'test_budget_activity_purchase' module, likely for testing or internal use within a larger project.",
  "sources": "The module import 'test_budget_activity_purchase'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A - only an import statement; no data flow or execution path involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a test module import could suggest testing code included in the package, but this alone is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license comment and an import statement for a test module. There are no data inputs, outputs, or execution logic. The import of a test module may indicate inclusion of testing code, but that is a common practice in development environments and does not imply malicious intent. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an import statement for a test module, with no malicious behavior detected. The presence of test code does not pose security risks in itself.",
