{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class TagVisitor used to extract and process tagged data from nested data structures, likely for parsing Hyoml data.",
  "sources": "Input data provided to the visit method, which could be any nested dict or list structure.",
  "sinks": "Modification of the input data in-place when '@'-prefixed keys are found; addition of '_tags' key with extracted tags.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input node into the visit method, where '@' keys are extracted and removed, then stored under '_tags'.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, no network operations, no suspicious data exfiltration or backdoors present. The code performs simple data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The class processes nested structures to extract keys starting with '@' and replaces them with a '_tags' dictionary. It recursively traverses dicts and lists, modifying data in place. There are no external data sources, network calls, or storage of sensitive information. The logic is straightforward and does not involve any suspicious or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for processing nested data structures, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. It simply extracts tags and restructures data as intended without malicious side effects.",
