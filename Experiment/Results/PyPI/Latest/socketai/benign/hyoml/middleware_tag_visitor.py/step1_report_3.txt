{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract and process tags from data parsed with Hyoml, converting keys starting with '@' into a '_tags' dictionary within the data structure.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the 'visit' method, which takes a 'node' argument that can be a dict, list, or other data types.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include modifications to the input data structure, specifically deletion of keys and insertion of the '_tags' key, but no external data or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input 'node' through recursive traversal, where keys starting with '@' are extracted into '_tags'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs straightforward data processing without unusual code constructs or obfuscated logic. It only modifies the data structure in a predictable manner.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'TagVisitor' with an 'visit' method that recursively traverses nested dictionaries and lists. It identifies keys starting with '@', extracts them into a '_tags' dictionary, and deletes the original keys. This is a standard data processing pattern, with no signs of malicious behavior. There are no external calls, no data exfiltration, or suspicious code logic. The code's behavior is benign and intended for data transformation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data processing utility for extracting tags from Hyoml-parsed data. It does not contain malware, suspicious activity, or security risks. It only modifies the data structure locally and does not perform any network or system operations.",
