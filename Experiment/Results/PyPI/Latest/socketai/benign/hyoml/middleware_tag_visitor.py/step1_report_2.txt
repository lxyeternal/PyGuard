{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to extract and process tags from data parsed by Hyoml, modifying the input data structure to include tags under the '_tags' key.",
  "sources": "Input data nodes, which can be dictionaries or lists, are read in the visit method when traversing the data structure.",
  "sinks": "The code writes back to the input data structure by deleting keys and adding a '_tags' key with extracted tags.",
  "flows": "Data is read from dictionaries and lists during traversal; tags are extracted from keys starting with '@' and stored; the modified data structure is returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs dynamic modifications to the input data by deleting keys and adding new keys, which could be used to obfuscate malicious modifications if embedded within larger systems. However, no external or malicious behaviors such as network calls, code execution, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a TagVisitor class with an initializer and a visit method. The visit method recursively traverses dictionaries and lists. When a dictionary key starts with '@', it extracts the tag (removing '@') and deletes the original key, storing the tag in a '_tags' dictionary. This '_tags' dictionary is added to the node. The process is straightforward and does not involve external data sources, network activity, or code execution. No suspicious code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The only notable aspect is that it modifies the data structure, which could potentially be misused if malicious data is processed, but this is within expected functionality for tag processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard recursive traversal to extract tags from data structures, modifying the input data accordingly. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The behavior is typical for tag extraction routines. No obfuscation or malicious intent is apparent.",
