{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to process and extract tags from data structures parsed from Hyoml, specifically handling nodes with keys starting with '@' and collecting them into a '_tags' key.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the 'visit' method, which takes a 'node' parameter that can be a dictionary or list. It accesses all items or elements within the data structure.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies the input data in-place by deleting certain keys and adding a '_tags' key with extracted tag data. No external output or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (dict/list) is traversed recursively. When keys starting with '@' are found, they are extracted into a '_tags' sub-dictionary, and the original key is deleted from the data structure.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs in-place modification of input data without validation or sanitization. There are no obvious security-related anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, network calls, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The class provides a straightforward mechanism to extract '@'-prefixed keys as tags, removing the original keys and storing the tags under '_tags'. It processes nested structures recursively. There is no suspicious or malicious behavior observed, and the code operates purely on data processing with no external interactions. The logic is simple, clear, and safe from a security perspective.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for extracting tags from Hyoml-parsed data. It performs straightforward data manipulation without malicious intent or security risks.",
