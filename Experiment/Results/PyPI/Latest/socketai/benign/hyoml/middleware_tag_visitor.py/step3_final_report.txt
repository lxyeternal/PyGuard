  "purpose": "Extracts and processes tags in nested data structures by removing keys starting with '@' and storing their values under '_tags'.",
  "sources": "Keys in dictionaries that start with '@'.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is modified in-place within the data structure.",
  "flows": "Source: '@'-prefixed keys in dicts -> Sink: removal from dict and storage under '_tags'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward data manipulation with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code recursively traverses dicts and lists, extracting '@'-prefixed keys into a '_tags' dictionary, deleting the original keys. It performs in-place modifications without external calls or side effects. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The logic is simple and consistent with benign data processing utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for extracting tags from nested data structures. It performs straightforward data restructuring without malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly assess its benign nature, and the scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified.",
