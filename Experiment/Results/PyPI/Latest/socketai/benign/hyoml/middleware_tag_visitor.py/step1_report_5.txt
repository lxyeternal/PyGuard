{
  "purpose": "Extracts and processes tags in Hyoml-parsed data by removing '@' prefixed keys and storing them separately.",
  "sources": "Input data provided to the 'visit' method, which can be dictionaries or lists containing the data structure.",
  "sinks": "Modifications made directly to input data; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into 'visit' method; '@'-prefixed keys are extracted and stored in '_tags', original keys are deleted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code recursively traverses data structures (dicts and lists), extracting keys starting with '@' and storing them in a '_tags' sub-dictionary. The process involves deleting original '@' keys after extraction. This operation is purely data manipulation without any network or system interactions. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation are present. The code appears to be a straightforward parser for tagging metadata within structured data.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a data parser for extracting tagged metadata, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs safe, standard operations on data structures.",
