{
  "purpose": "A wrapper class delegating validation to various imported format modules, serving as a centralized validator.",
  "sources": "Input data passed to each static validation method, which then calls the validate() method of the respective imported module.",
  "sinks": "The validate() methods of external modules; potential data leaks or malicious behavior depend on their implementation, but the wrapper itself does not process untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the static methods into the imported module's validate() functions, with no additional processing or data manipulation within the wrapper.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected. The code is a straightforward delegation pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple formatter modules, each providing a validate() method. The Validator class offers static methods that invoke these validate() methods directly. There are no network calls, file operations, environment variable manipulations, or dynamic code execution. The structure is simple and transparent. Given the lack of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code, and assuming the external modules are trustworthy, the code is benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with this analysis. Dependency trust remains a consideration, but the code itself does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward validation utility wrapper with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency.",
