{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Validator class that provides static methods to validate various data formats (JSON, YAML, ENV, INI, etc.) using imported formatter modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads data passed as arguments to validation functions such as isValidJSON, isValidYAML, etc.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the functions invoke validate methods from imported modules. There are no network or system commands, no file writes, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the validate functions of imported modules via static method calls; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks are evident in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, unusual code, obfuscated constructs, or hidden backdoors. It relies entirely on external modules for validation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple formatter modules and wraps their validate methods within a Validator class, providing a clean interface for format validation. The functions are static, simple, and do not perform any processing beyond calling the respective validate method. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. The code appears to be a standard, safe utility class with no embedded malware or security risks. The overall design is typical for a validation wrapper and does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or data exfiltration points.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, straightforward validator wrapper that delegates validation tasks to imported modules. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
