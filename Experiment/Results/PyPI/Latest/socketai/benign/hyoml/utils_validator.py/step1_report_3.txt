  "purpose": "A centralized validator class for multiple data formats using imported validation modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through various static methods, each calling a validate() method from imported formatter modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential data validation functions could process untrusted input, but no direct sinks like system calls or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method parameters into corresponding validate() functions from imported modules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. All imports appear to be standard data format validators.",
  "analysis": "The script imports multiple formatter modules and defines static methods to validate different data formats by delegating to each module's validate() method. No input/output operations, network calls, or system modifications are present. The structure is straightforward, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. It assumes the imported modules are safe and trustworthy. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a clean, centralized interface to validate various data formats. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious code, or security risks within this module. It appears safe and purpose-specific.",
