{
  "purpose": "The code provides a centralized validation class for multiple data formats used in Hyoml output validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data passed as arguments to various static validation methods for different formats.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; potential vulnerabilities could arise if validate methods internally process untrusted data insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input data is passed to format-specific validate methods, with no additional data processing or external interactions shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code mainly delegates validation to imported modules.",
  "analysis": "The script imports numerous format validation modules and defines a Validator class with static methods to validate each format by calling the corresponding validate() method. There are no direct data manipulations, network interactions, or suspicious code patterns. The pattern is straightforward: method receives data, calls a validate function, and returns its result. Without insight into the imported modules, no malicious or maliciously intended behaviors are evident. The code appears purely for data validation and centralizes calls for convenience.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as a wrapper for format validation modules, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated code, suspicious data handling, or external network activity. Overall, it appears safe.",
