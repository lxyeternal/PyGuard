{
  "purpose": "Converts dictionary data into minimal RDF/XML structure with optional tuple restoration.",
  "sources": "Input data passed to format(), data read during _walk() and clean_output() functions.",
  "sinks": "Embedding data into XML strings; no external network or system calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input through clean_output and _walk into XML string construction.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for error reporting; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward RDF/XML formatter that serializes dictionary data into XML. It does not perform network operations, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. Error handling via print statements is benign. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or external dependencies are present. Potential injection points exist if malicious data is provided, but this is typical in serialization routines. External functions like clean_output are assumed benign. Overall, the code exhibits no malicious behavior or obfuscation, and the security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data formatter with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain risks. The scores in the reports are appropriate; minor adjustments to reduce the security risk score to zero are recommended given the benign nature of the code.",
