{
  "purpose": "To convert dictionary data into minimal RDF/XML format, supporting tuple restoration and RDF serialization.",
  "sources": "Input data parameter in the format method; potentially external data passed to the formatter.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, but data is embedded into XML strings which could be exploited if untrusted data is malicious.",
  "flows": "Input data is cleaned with 'clean_output', then processed in '_walk', and finally embedded into XML tags for output.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses print statements for error reporting instead of logging or exception handling, which could be considered a mild concern but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls are present. The code appears straightforward and primarily transforms data into XML.",
  "analysis": "The code processes input data by cleaning and walking the data structure, optionally restoring tuples, then serializes it into RDF/XML format. The implementation is standard and does not include any network operations, dynamic code execution, or suspicious code paths. Error handling uses print statements, but this does not introduce malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious data leakage mechanisms are detected. Overall, the logic is a typical data formatter with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a straightforward RDF/XML formatter for dictionary data with optional tuple restoration. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The implementation is standard, and no suspicious activity is evident.",
