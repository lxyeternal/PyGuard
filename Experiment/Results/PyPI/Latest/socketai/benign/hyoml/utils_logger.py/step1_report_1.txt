{
  "purpose": "Provide a simple logging utility for the Hyoml project.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'name' parameter (default 'hyoml') and the 'level' parameter (default logging.INFO) to configure the logger.",
  "sinks": "The logger outputs to the standard stream via StreamHandler, which is typical for logging. No external or untrusted data is directed elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The function creates or retrieves a logger, configures a stream handler with a formatter, and sets the log level. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks beyond standard logging outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and adheres to common logging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to set up a logger with a specified name and level. It ensures only one handler is added per logger instance, avoiding duplication. Uses standard Python logging modules without any obfuscated or malicious constructs. No input validation issues or external data manipulation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended without exposing sensitive information or malicious activities.",
