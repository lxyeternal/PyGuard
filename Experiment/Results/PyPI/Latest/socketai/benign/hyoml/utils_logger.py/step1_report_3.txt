{
  "purpose": "Provide a configurable logging utility for the Hyoml application.",
  "sources": "The function get_logger reads the 'name' parameter and retrieves or creates a logger instance with the specified name. It also uses the 'level' parameter to set the logging level.",
  "sinks": "The logger outputs logs to the standard stream via StreamHandler; no untrusted input is directly sent to external systems or over the network.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'name' and 'level' influence logger configuration but do not lead to external data leaks or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The code dynamically configures a logger with user-specified parameters in a safe manner.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple logging utility that initializes a logger with a specified name and level. It creates a stream handler with a formatter for log messages. The code is straightforward, with no external data sources, no code execution, and no suspicious patterns. It adheres to standard logging practices and does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for use and does not pose supply chain threats.",
