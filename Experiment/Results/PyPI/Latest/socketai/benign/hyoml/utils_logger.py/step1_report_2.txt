{
  "purpose": "Provides a simple logging utility for the Hyoml project to standardize logging output.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'logging' module, which is a standard Python library; uses getLogger, StreamHandler, and Formatter functions; accepts optional parameters for logger name and level.",
  "sinks": "Uses a StreamHandler to output logs to standard output; no external data sinks or network communications are present.",
  "flows": "The function creates or retrieves a logger, adds a stream handler if none exists, sets formatter and level, and returns the logger instance.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code follows typical logging setup procedures with no suspicious constructs or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the standard logging library, defines a function to create and configure a logger with optional name and level parameters. It checks if handlers are already attached to avoid duplicate handlers, adds a StreamHandler with a formatter, sets the log level, and returns the logger. The implementation is straightforward, uses standard practices, and contains no unusual or suspicious elements. No hardcoded secrets, external communications, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign logging utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply facilitates logging within the application.",
