{
  "purpose": "A simple logging utility for the Hyoml project, providing a configurable logger setup.",
  "sources": "The function get_logger reads the 'name' parameter and the 'level' parameter; the logger.getLogger retrieves or creates a logger object.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that handle untrusted input data or perform sensitive operations such as network communication or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The function creates or retrieves a logger, configures a stream handler and formatter, then returns the logger object. No data flows from external sources into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with standard logging setup. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility function for creating a logger with optional custom name and level. It checks for existing handlers to avoid duplication, sets up a stream handler with a formatter, and assigns the logging level. No untrusted data input, external data flows, or malicious behaviors are evident. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior. The code appears safe and standard for logging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply configures a logger for use within a project, with no suspicious or malicious features.",
