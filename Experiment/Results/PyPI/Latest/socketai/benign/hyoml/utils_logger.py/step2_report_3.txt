  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided code and reports:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code is a straightforward implementation of a logging utility.\n   - It imports the standard `logging` module.\n   - The `get_logger` function creates or retrieves a logger with a specified name and level.\n   - It adds a `StreamHandler` with a formatter if no handlers are attached.\n   - It sets the logger's level and returns the logger object.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, external data manipulation, or malicious behavior.\n   - The code does not process untrusted input beyond parameters for name and level, which are controlled by the application.\n\n2. **Issues Present in the Code:**\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n   - The code adheres to standard Python logging practices.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1.0, and the malware scores are 0, indicating no malicious intent.\n   - The reasoning in each report is consistent and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 is justified; the code does not introduce security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code does not process untrusted data in a malicious way.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on unfounded assumptions.\n   - The code does not contain any dynamic code execution, external communications, or secrets.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard, safe logging utility.\n   - No modifications or security concerns are necessary based on the current analysis.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No further action or concern is warranted.",
