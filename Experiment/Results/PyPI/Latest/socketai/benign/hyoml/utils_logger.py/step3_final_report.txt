  "purpose": "A simple utility to configure and retrieve a Python logger with standard formatting.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'name' and 'level' for logger configuration; internal calls to getLogger, addHandler, setLevel.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or external inputs beyond parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> getLogger -> addHandler -> setLevel -> return logger; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard logging practices, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to create or retrieve a logger, adds a stream handler with a formatter if none exist, and sets the logging level. It employs standard Python logging modules with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is clear, simple, and adheres to best practices. No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are involved. The parameters are controlled and safe. No vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging utility with no security risks or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify it as safe, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The assessments are accurate and justified.",
