  "purpose": "To remove specified metadata keys from a dictionary, cleaning the data for further processing.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'data' which is checked for being a dict; the 'omit_keys' list used to specify keys to remove.",
  "sinks": "The returned dictionary after filtering; no external sinks or data leaks are involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'data' -> type check -> dictionary comprehension filtering out 'omit_keys' -> output dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs a straightforward filtering operation with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The function checks if 'data' is a dict; if not, returns it unchanged. If it is, it filters out keys specified in 'omit_keys' (default list). The filtering uses a dictionary comprehension, which is safe and standard. No external interactions, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code is simple, clear, and intended for data sanitization. No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious patterns are detected. The default omit keys are common metadata keys, and the function does not perform any risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for cleaning dictionaries by removing specific keys. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
