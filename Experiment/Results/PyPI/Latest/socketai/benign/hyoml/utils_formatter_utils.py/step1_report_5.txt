{
  "purpose": "The function removes specified metadata keys from a dictionary, cleaning the data for output.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'data' (expected to be a dictionary), and optional 'omit_keys' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The function does not contain any sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Data is checked for type; if a dictionary, it filters out keys in 'omit_keys'; otherwise, it returns data unchanged.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data cleaning function. It verifies if 'data' is a dict, then filters out specific keys. Default omit keys are provided. No external inputs or outputs are involved beyond the parameters, and there are no dynamic code executions or network interactions. The code serves a basic data processing purpose without any suspicious logic or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data cleaning utility with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is straightforward and adheres to safe programming practices.",
