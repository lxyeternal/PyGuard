{
  "purpose": "The function is designed to clean a dictionary by removing specified metadata keys.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'data' which is expected to be a dictionary",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data; the function only manipulates input data without external communication or system modification",
  "flows": "Input data flows through the type check, then into a dictionary comprehension that filters out certain keys",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures observed; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a docstring explaining its purpose. It performs a type check on 'data' to ensure it's a dictionary; if not, it returns the data unchanged. It sets default omit_keys if none are provided. The return statement constructs a new dictionary excluding specified keys. The code is straightforward, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. It only filters keys from a dictionary and does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility function for cleaning dictionaries by removing certain metadata keys. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
