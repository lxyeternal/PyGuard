{
  "purpose": "The function removes specific metadata keys from a dictionary to clean or sanitize the data.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'data', which is expected to be a dictionary.",
  "sinks": "The returned dictionary after filtering out certain keys; no external or untrusted data sink is explicitly involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'data' through a type check, then through a dictionary comprehension filtering out specific keys, and finally returns the cleaned dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs straightforward data filtering without unusual code patterns or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The function begins by verifying if 'data' is a dictionary. If not, it returns the input unchanged. If 'data' is a dictionary, it sets default keys to omit unless specified otherwise. It then constructs and returns a new dictionary excluding the specified keys. The code is simple, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data cleaning utility with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs safe filtering of dictionary keys for data sanitization.",
