{
  "purpose": "The function cleans a dictionary by removing specific metadata keys, primarily for data sanitization or preprocessing.",
  "sources": "The function reads the 'data' parameter, which is expected to be a dictionary, and the optional 'omit_keys' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The function outputs a dictionary after filtering keys; no untrusted data sinks are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Input 'data' flows into the dictionary comprehension which filters out specified keys, producing cleaned data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated logic are present. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The function first checks if 'data' is a dictionary; if not, it returns 'data' unchanged. It sets a default list of keys to omit unless provided. Then, it constructs and returns a new dictionary excluding the keys listed in 'omit_keys'. The logic is simple and safe, with no suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious operations observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data cleaning utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply removes specified keys from a dictionary. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
