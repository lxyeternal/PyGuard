{
  "purpose": "The function is designed to clean a dictionary by removing specific metadata or user-defined keys.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'data' which is expected to be a dictionary, and optional 'omit_keys' parameter provided by the user.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a filtered dictionary, but no sinks are evident that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'data' parameter through the filtering comprehension, resulting in a cleaned dictionary with certain keys omitted.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code performs straightforward filtering. The default omit keys list is static and does not contain any sensitive information or suspicious entries.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a check to ensure 'data' is a dictionary; if not, it returns the data unchanged, avoiding errors. It sets 'omit_keys' to a default list if none is provided. The return statement uses dictionary comprehension to exclude specified keys. The logic is simple, clear, and free of any complex or obfuscated code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The function appears safe and intended solely for data cleaning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for cleaning dictionaries by removing specific keys. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in this implementation.",
