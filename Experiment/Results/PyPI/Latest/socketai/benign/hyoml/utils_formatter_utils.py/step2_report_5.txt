  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, safe, and performs simple dictionary filtering.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The code is a standard utility function for data sanitization.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: it checks if 'data' is a dict, then filters out specified keys, returning a new dictionary.\n- No issues with the logic, and no suspicious behaviors are identified.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which seems appropriate given the analysis.\n- The purpose and flow are consistent, and no claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n- The 'malware' score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the lack of malicious behavior.\n- The 'obfuscated' score is 0, as expected.\n- The 'securityRisk' score is 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Justification for Scores:**\n- Since the code is a simple, safe data filtering utility, no higher scores are warranted.\n- The confidence score is 1, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n- The code does not pose any security risks or malicious concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\nThe code is a safe, standard data cleaning utility with no security concerns.",
