{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class 'DirectiveVisitor' that processes parsed Hyoml structures to extract directives and modify the data structure accordingly.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'node' parameter passed to the 'visit' method, which can be a dictionary or list.",
  "sinks": "Potential modification points are the deletion of dictionary keys (del node[k]) and insertion of '_directives' key, which could affect data integrity if untrusted data is processed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'node' input through recursive 'visit' calls, with directives extracted from dictionary keys starting with '%', and modifications made to the data structure.",
  "anomalies": "The code unconditionally deletes keys starting with '%', which could remove important data, but this appears intentional for directive extraction. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The class processes structured data to extract directives marked with '%'. It modifies the input data structure by removing directive keys and adding a '_directives' field. The code uses standard Python data manipulation and recursion without external or suspicious dependencies. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware are evident. The code's purpose seems legitimate for parsing and processing directive annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate parser for directives in Hyoml structures, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs expected data processing tasks safely, assuming trusted input data.",
