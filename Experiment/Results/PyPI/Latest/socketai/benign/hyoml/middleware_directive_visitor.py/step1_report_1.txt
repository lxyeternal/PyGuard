{
  "purpose": "The class DirectiveVisitor is designed to traverse and modify parsed Hyoml structures by extracting directives from dictionary keys that start with '%'.",
  "sources": "Input data is the 'node' parameter passed to the 'visit' method, which can be a dict or list containing parsed Hyoml data structures.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include modification of the input 'node' structure, specifically deletion of keys starting with '%', and insertion of '_directives' into the node.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'node' through recursive calls, where directive keys are extracted and removed, and directives are stored in '_directives'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code performs standard recursive traversal and key manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that processes data structures by removing keys starting with '%' and collecting them into a '_directives' key. It performs standard recursive traversal over dictionaries and lists. No external data sources, network access, or system commands are used. The logic appears straightforward and related to parsing or processing configuration directives within a data structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data structure traversal and transformation class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It may be part of a configuration parsing system. The code does not perform any dangerous or suspicious operations.",
