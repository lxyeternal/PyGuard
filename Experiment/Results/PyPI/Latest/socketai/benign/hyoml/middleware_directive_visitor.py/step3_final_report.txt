  "purpose": "Extracts directives from parsed data structures by removing keys starting with '%' and storing their values under '_directives'.",
  "sources": "Keys in dictionaries that start with '%', and nested data structures (dicts and lists).",
  "sinks": "Modification of the input 'node' by deleting keys and adding '_directives', which could affect data integrity if data is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Reading keys starting with '%' in dicts, deleting these keys, and assigning their values to '_directives' within the same data structure.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional deletion of keys starting with '%' could impact data integrity if directives are important; no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a recursive traversal of nested data structures, extracting keys starting with '%', removing them, and storing their values under '_directives'. It does not perform any network activity, system calls, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent. The only potential concern is in-place modification of data, which could be problematic if data trustworthiness is uncertain, but this is a typical pattern for directive extraction. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for directive extraction within data structures, with no malicious intent or security risks. The low risk score reflects minor in-place modifications, but overall, it is benign.",
