{
  "purpose": "The class DirectiveVisitor processes parsed Hyoml structures to extract directives indicated by keys starting with '%'. It modifies the input data by removing directive keys and storing them separately.",
  "sources": "The 'visit' method reads from the input 'node', which can be a dictionary or list, processing its contents recursively.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies the 'node' in-place by deleting keys and adding a '_directives' key; no external sinks or untrusted data handling are apparent.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through 'visit' method, with directive keys (starting with '%') being extracted and stored separately; the rest of the data is processed recursively without external outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code performs straightforward data restructuring. It does not execute any external commands, access system resources, or perform network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to process data structures, specifically extracting directive keys from dictionaries. It operates solely in memory, recursively traversing nested dictionaries and lists, removing keys starting with '%' and storing them under '_directives'. There are no external data sources, network operations, or security-sensitive functions involved. The logic is simple, transparent, and does not appear to be malicious or suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data processing utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply extracts directives from nested data structures for potential further use.",
