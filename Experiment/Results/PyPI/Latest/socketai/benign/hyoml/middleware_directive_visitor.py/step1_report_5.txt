{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to process and extract directives from parsed Hyoml structures, modifying the input data structure in place.",
  "sources": "The input `node` parameter, which can be a dictionary or list, read during traversal.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies the input data structure directly; no external sinks are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "The `visit` method reads from `node`, modifies it in place, and potentially adds a `_directives` key when directives are found.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behavior detected. The code uses standard Python constructs for data traversal and modification.",
  "analysis": "The class `DirectiveVisitor` initializes with optional configuration and provides a `visit` method that recursively traverses a nested data structure (dicts and lists). It extracts keys starting with '%' from dictionaries, removes them, and stores their values under a `_directives` key. This process is typical for directive extraction or annotation processing in data structures. The code performs in-place modifications and does not execute untrusted code, connect to external resources, or perform suspicious actions. No obfuscation or malicious logic is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for processing directives within data structures. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, contains no malware indicators, and has a very low security risk profile.",
