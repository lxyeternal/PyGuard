{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class DirectiveVisitor used to extract or apply directives from parsed Hyoml structures by modifying the input data structures (dicts and lists).",
  "sources": "Input data structures passed to the visit() method, which can be dicts or lists.",
  "sinks": "Potential modification points where directives are extracted and removed from the data structure, specifically at node[k] and node[k[1:]] assignments.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input structures into the visit() method, where directives (keys starting with '%') are extracted and removed, then possibly stored under '_directives'.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs key manipulation based on string prefix '%', but there are no apparent hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No dynamic code execution or network activity. No obfuscated or suspicious language features.",
  "analysis": "The class provides functionality to parse and modify nested data structures by removing keys starting with '%' and storing them separately under '_directives'. The implementation is straightforward and does not perform any network operations, file access, or external system interactions. It only manipulates the input data in a predictable manner. No anomalies or malicious patterns are evident. The logic appears to be intended for configuration or directive extraction, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for processing directive keys in nested data structures. It does not contain malware or security risks, nor does it exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent.",
