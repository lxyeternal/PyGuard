  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting between dict, list, and tuple data structures.",
  "sources": "Input functions receive data via function arguments, typically user-supplied or from other code modules.",
  "sinks": "Data conversions result in new data structures; no data is transmitted externally or to untrusted sources within this code.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated for type, then converted into other data structures, and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. All conversions are straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple data structure conversions with type validation. No external data sources or sinks are present. No malicious code, such as network access, system modifications, or obfuscation, is evident. The functions perform basic data manipulations without side effects. No suspicious behaviors, credential handling, or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for data structure conversion with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
