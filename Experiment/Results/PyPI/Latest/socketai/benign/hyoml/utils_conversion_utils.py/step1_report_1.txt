  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for converting between dict, list, and tuple data structures.",
  "sources": "Function arguments: data parameters (dict, list, or tuple) supplied to each conversion function.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; functions perform in-memory conversions only.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into type validation checks, then into conversion functions, returning converted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected. No dynamic execution or unsafe operations present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple utility functions that convert data between dict, list, and tuple forms. Each function performs a type check to ensure correct input types before conversion, raising ValueError otherwise. The functions use standard Python methods like .items(), list(), and tuple() for conversions. There are no external data interactions, network operations, or file I/O. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and performs simple, common data transformations with proper validation. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely utility functions for data structure conversions with appropriate validation. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe and non-malicious.",
