  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting between dict, list, and tuple data structures.",
  "sources": "None; functions take input parameters, typically from external or internal sources, but no explicit data input reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted; functions only perform data structure transformations.",
  "flows": "Input data is received as function arguments, validated, and converted to different data structures within the function scope.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. All functions perform straightforward data conversions with standard type checks.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple utility functions for data structure conversions, each performing input validation and conversion. No external data sources, network activity, or system modifications are involved. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious code flow. All functions are standard, simple, and do not pose any security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign, well-structured data conversion utilities with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
