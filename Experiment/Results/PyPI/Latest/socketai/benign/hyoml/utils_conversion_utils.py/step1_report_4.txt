  "sinks": "Return statements that output converted data structures.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into conversion functions; outputs are returned after type validation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns observed. No hardcoded secrets or external data accesses.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward data structure conversions with type validation. No external data sources, network calls, or file I/O. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic present. Functions raise errors if input types are incorrect, which is standard validation. Overall, simple utility functions with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for data conversion. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a safe, standard implementation.",
