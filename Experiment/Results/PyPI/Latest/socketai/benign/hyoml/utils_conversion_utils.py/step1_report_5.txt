  "sinks": "Return statements that output converted data; no external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated and then transformed into different data structures, returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution; straightforward utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements basic data structure conversions with input validation and error handling. No external network, file access, or environment variable usage is present. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed. The functions perform simple data transformations, and no malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as utility functions for data structure conversions, and contains no malicious intent or security risks.",
