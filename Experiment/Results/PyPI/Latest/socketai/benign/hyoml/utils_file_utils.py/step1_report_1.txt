  "purpose": "Utility functions for reading from and writing to files, intended for handling file I/O operations within the Hyoml project.",
  "sources": "File paths provided as arguments to load_file and save_file functions.",
  "sinks": "File operations (open, read, write), which handle data read from or written to disk based on external input.",
  "flows": "Input file paths flow into open() calls, and data from load_file flows out; content to be saved flows into save_file and is written to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or anomalies observed; the functions perform standard file I/O operations without any obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two straightforward utility functions for file reading and writing, each wrapped with exception handling. No malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior detected. Usage of open() with user-provided paths is typical for such utilities; no dangerous pattern like executing code or network activity. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign file I/O utility module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code is simple, well-structured, and performs common operations safely.",
