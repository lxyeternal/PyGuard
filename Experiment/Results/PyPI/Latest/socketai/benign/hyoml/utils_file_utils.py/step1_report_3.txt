{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for loading and saving files, likely used within the Hyoml project for file I/O operations.",
  "sources": "File open/read operations in load_file, and file open/write operations in save_file.",
  "sinks": "File I/O functions serve as sinks; however, they do not process untrusted data directly, just handle file paths and contents provided as arguments.",
  "flows": "External inputs (file paths, contents) flow into open/read/write calls without validation or sanitization; no other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are detected. Exception handling only logs errors and re-raises them.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple utility functions for file operations with standard exception handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions rely on parameters provided by the caller, with no validation beyond exception catching. No external network calls or hidden behaviors are present. The code appears safe and typical for file handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides straightforward file I/O utilities with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It operates as expected for file read/write functions without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
