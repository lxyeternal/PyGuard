  "purpose": "Utility functions for reading from and writing to files, used in the Hyoml project.",
  "sources": "File paths provided as arguments to load_file and save_file functions.",
  "sinks": "File operations that can access or modify files on the filesystem.",
  "flows": "Input file paths from function arguments flow into open() calls; file content is read or written based on the mode.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. Error handling is straightforward; no suspicious logging or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple, standard file I/O utilities with exception handling. There is no user input processing beyond file paths, no external network communication, and no use of environment variables or other external data sources. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors. The try-except blocks capture exceptions during file operations and re-raise them after logging, which is typical and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of file I/O utilities with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It handles file reading and writing safely within its scope.",
