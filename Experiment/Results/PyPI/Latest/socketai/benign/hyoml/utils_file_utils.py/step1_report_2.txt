  "sources": "File paths provided as arguments to load_file() and save_file() functions.",
  "sinks": "File operations (open, read, write) using untrusted file paths; error printing.",
  "flows": "Input file paths -> open files -> read or write contents.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or malicious code, no obfuscated code. Use of exception handling for file I/O is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic file I/O utilities with proper exception handling and customizable encoding. No user input is processed directly within the functions; file paths are parameters. No network or external data transfer occurs. No suspicious behavior or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard file input/output operations without any malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be benign utility code for managing files.",
