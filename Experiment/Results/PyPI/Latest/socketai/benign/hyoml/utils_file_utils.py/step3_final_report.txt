  "sources": "File path parameters in load_file and save_file functions.",
  "sinks": "Return of file contents in load_file; writing content to files in save_file.",
  "flows": "Input file path -> open file -> read/write content -> output or save file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard implementation, no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward file I/O utilities with exception handling. It accepts external file paths without validation, which could pose minimal security concerns if paths are maliciously crafted, but no malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The functions do not perform network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic execution are used. The exception handling is standard, and the code is structurally simple and clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The slight security risk score (~0.1) reflects potential misuse of untrusted file paths but does not indicate actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
