  "purpose": "Utility functions for reading from and writing to files, specifically for the Hyoml project.",
  "sources": "File paths provided as arguments to load_file and save_file functions.",
  "sinks": "File I/O operations that write to or read from the filesystem, which could potentially be manipulated if untrusted input is provided as the path.",
  "flows": "Input file path (source) passed to open() function, leading to file read or write (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The code handles exceptions gracefully. No use of dynamic execution or obfuscated code. No network or external data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic file I/O utilities with exception handling. It accepts file paths and modes as arguments, performs standard open/read/write operations, and catches exceptions. No suspicious behaviors such as network access, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution are present. The functions are straightforward, standard, and do not involve any dynamic code execution or external calls that could be malicious. There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. The exception handling merely logs errors and re-raises IOErrors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of file read/write utilities with proper exception handling. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks beyond normal file I/O operations. No malware or security concerns detected.",
