{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a mathematical calculation server with basic arithmetic tools using the FastMCP framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data; it defines functions and creates a server instance.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output, network communication, or external data sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; functions operate on parameters, and the server runs without external input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a math server.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a server class from a library, creates a server instance, and registers four arithmetic functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) as tools. These functions perform simple calculations with input validation for division by zero. The server runs if executed directly. No external data sources, network connections, or obfuscated/malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign mathematical calculation server implementation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
