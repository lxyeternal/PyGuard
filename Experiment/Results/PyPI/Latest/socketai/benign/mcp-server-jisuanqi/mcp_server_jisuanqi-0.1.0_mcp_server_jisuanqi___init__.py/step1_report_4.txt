{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a mathematical calculation server with basic arithmetic tools (add, subtract, multiply, divide) using the FastMCP framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources; it defines functions and initializes a server object.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; the functions perform simple arithmetic and raise exceptions for invalid inputs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the functions operate on parameters passed at runtime, with no evident external input handling or data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated patterns, or unusual constructs are present. The code performs straightforward arithmetic operations with standard error handling.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a server framework and creates an MCP server instance with a name 'jisuanqi'. It defines four arithmetic functions decorated as tools, each performing basic calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Each function has clear argument annotations and docstrings. Division includes a check for division by zero, raising a ValueError if attempted. There are no external data sources, no data sinks that transmit data outside the local environment, and no evidence of malicious behavior or anomalies. The code appears to serve a simple, benign purpose: providing calculation tools over an MCP server.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a math server exposing basic arithmetic tools. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and free from malicious code or security risks.",
