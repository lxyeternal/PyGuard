  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Implements a server named \"jisuanqi\" using the FastMCP framework.\n- Registers four arithmetic tools: add, subtract, multiply, divide.\n- Each function is straightforward, with input validation for division by zero.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or network communication beyond server startup.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code patterns.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Presence of Issues in the Code\n**Confirmed:**  \n- The code functions as intended for a basic calculator server.  \n- No signs of malicious code, data leaks, or security flaws are evident.\n\n**Not present:**  \n- External input validation beyond the division check.  \n- External data sources or sinks.  \n- Obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports\n**Observation:**  \n- All reports are consistent and correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and free of malicious intent.  \n- They correctly note the absence of external data handling, obfuscation, or anomalies.\n\n**Minor critique:**  \n- The reports could emphasize that the server exposes functions via remote invocation, which, while not inherently dangerous, could be a surface for abuse if exposed publicly. However, since no network security considerations are discussed, this is not a concern here.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Score Justifications\n**Malware score (all reports):**  \n- Consistently 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- 0, correct, as code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Security risk / overall risk scores:**  \n- 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Scores seem reasonable and consistent with the detailed reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5\n- All scores are 0, indicating no risk.  \n- This is justified given the benign, straightforward code.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Malware Score Justification\n- No malicious activity, no suspicious code, no external data exfiltration, no obfuscation.  \n- Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Claims Based on Assumptions\n- No suspicious assumptions are made in the reports.  \n- The reports avoid speculation and base conclusions on code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Consistency of Scores\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated scores based on the code:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0** | **0** | **0** |\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a simple, well-documented server exposing basic arithmetic functions.  \n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors are present.  \n- The server's remote invocation capability does not imply malicious intent; it is a typical pattern for such services.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as non-malicious, non-obfuscated, and low risk. No changes are necessary.",
