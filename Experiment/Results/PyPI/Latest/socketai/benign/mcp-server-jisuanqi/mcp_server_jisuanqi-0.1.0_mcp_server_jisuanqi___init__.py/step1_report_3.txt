{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple calculator server using the FastMCP framework, exposing four basic arithmetic tools (add, subtract, multiply, divide) for remote invocation.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'mcp.server.fastmcp' to initialize the MCP server, and the decorator functions that register the tools.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain untrusted data sinks such as network transmissions, file writes, or system commands that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "Inputs 'a' and 'b' are received via remote tool calls, processed through arithmetic functions, and results are returned; no external or untrusted data is directly used or stored.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The functions are straightforward calculations with proper error handling for division by zero.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up an MCP server with four arithmetic functions as tools, all defined with clear inputs and outputs, including error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The use of a known framework (FastMCP) suggests legitimate functionality, and no external or untrusted data sources are involved. The code structure is clear, with standard practices applied.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a remote calculator service using the FastMCP framework. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code segment.",
