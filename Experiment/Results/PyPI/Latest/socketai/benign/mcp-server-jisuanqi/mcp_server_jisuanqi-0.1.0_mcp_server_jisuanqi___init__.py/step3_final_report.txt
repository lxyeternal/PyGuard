{
  "purpose": "Provides basic arithmetic calculation functions exposed via a FastMCP server named 'jisuanqi'.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to arithmetic functions (a, b).",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (a, b) flow into arithmetic functions, which return results; no external data flow or network communication beyond server startup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-documented, with proper validation for division by zero.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a server with four arithmetic tools: add, subtract, multiply, divide. Each function performs simple calculations with validation where necessary. No external data sources, sinks, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The server runs if executed directly, exposing these functions for remote invocation. The code is clear, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of a remote calculator server. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are detected. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, reflecting the safe and simple nature of the code.",
