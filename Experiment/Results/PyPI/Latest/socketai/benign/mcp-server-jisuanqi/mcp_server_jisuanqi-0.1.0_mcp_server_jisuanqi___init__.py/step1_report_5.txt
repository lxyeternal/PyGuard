{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a mathematical computation server with basic arithmetic tools using the FastMCP framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads input via function arguments (a, b) for each arithmetic operation.",
  "sinks": "The code returns computed results directly, with no evident data leaks or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Input arguments (a, b) are processed through arithmetic functions, which then return the results.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present. No dynamic execution or external network calls observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a FastMCP server class, creates an instance with a specific name, and defines four basic arithmetic tools (add, subtract, multiply, divide). Each function processes numerical input and returns results, with proper error handling for division by zero. The server is started in the main block. No input/output channels, network communication, or sensitive data handling is present. The code appears straightforward and legitimate for its purpose, with no signs of malicious activity or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple arithmetic computation server with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to perform mathematical operations without external interactions or data leakage concerns.",
