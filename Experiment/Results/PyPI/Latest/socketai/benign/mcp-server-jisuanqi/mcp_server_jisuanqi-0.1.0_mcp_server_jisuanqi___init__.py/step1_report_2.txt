{
  "purpose": "Define and expose simple arithmetic calculation tools via an MCP server for remote invocation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines functions and initializes a server with a specific string argument.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is used or passed to external systems; functions perform arithmetic calculations only.",
  "flows": "No external data flows into or out of the code; the functions are purely computational, and server runs with static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. No obfuscated code, unusual patterns, or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an MCP server named 'jisuanqi' and registers four arithmetic functions as tools, with clear documentation. It performs no network operations beyond server startup, no input handling, and no malicious system interactions. There are no anomalies or suspicious behaviors. The functions are straightforward calculations with proper error handling for division by zero. No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data are present. The overall structure is simple and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign, straightforward server code exposing arithmetic functions. No malicious intent or security issues detected.",
