  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate the reports and the code:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, implementing a simple calculation server.\n   - No external data sources, network communication, or data sinks that could be exploited are present.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n   - The functions perform basic arithmetic with proper validation (division by zero), indicating standard safe practices.\n\n2. **Code Analysis:**\n   - The code imports from a known framework (`mcp.server.fastmcp`) and sets up a server with four arithmetic tools.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n   - The server is configured with a static name (`jisuanqi`) and exposes functions for remote invocation, but these are benign mathematical operations.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0, justified by the absence of vulnerabilities, secrets, or malicious intent.\n   - **Confidence Levels:** Very high (0.95–1), indicating strong agreement among reports.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent; no logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The code is simple and does not involve any assumptions that could lead to vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Suggestions for Score Adjustments:**\n   - The scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No changes necessary; the assessments are aligned with the code's characteristics.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of a remote calculator server.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or vulnerable elements are present.\n- The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and should remain as is.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code poses no security threat based on the provided information.",
