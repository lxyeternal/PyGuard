  "purpose": "Create a GUI with dynamic widget creation, user input handling, and layout configuration.",
  "sources": "Widget creation functions, user input from Entry widgets, command bindings for buttons.",
  "sinks": "Updating Label text via button commands, configuring widget properties.",
  "flows": "Button command lambda -> get Entry text -> configure Label text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a standard tkinter GUI application with classes for window setup and widget management. It dynamically creates buttons, labels, and entries based on configuration dictionaries, binds commands to update label text with user input, and arranges widgets with pack/place. No malicious behaviors, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of sabotage or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign and transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward tkinter GUI application with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the reports accurately reflect this assessment.",
