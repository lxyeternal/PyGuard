  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing and possibly network communication, but specific intent cannot be determined without further context.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, or external data files (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential output functions, network calls, or data storage points (not explicitly shown).",
  "flows": "Data reading points potentially leading to processing and output or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials or suspicious code patterns observed. The code structure appears standard with no obfuscated or suspicious language features.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for malicious activity, including data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network behavior. No indicators of such malicious behavior or malware were identified. Usage of third-party libraries is standard, and no suspicious code segments, hardcoded secrets, or malicious functions are present. Without specific details of input/output points, the assessment remains limited but shows no immediate threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or malware. It appears to be legitimate data processing code with no evident security risks based on the provided snippet.",
