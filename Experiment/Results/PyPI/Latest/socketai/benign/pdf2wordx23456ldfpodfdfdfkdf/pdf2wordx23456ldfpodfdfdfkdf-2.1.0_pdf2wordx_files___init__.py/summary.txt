  "conclusion": "The code appears benign overall, with no confirmed malicious activity or obfuscation. The main concern is the use of eval/exec in report 5, which increases potential risk but does not confirm malicious intent. The current scoring is appropriate; however, the risk score for report 5 should be slightly increased from 0.45 to around 0.5 to better reflect the inherent danger of dynamic code execution functions, especially in supply chain contexts."
