  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or manipulation, possibly involving user input or external data sources.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from environment variables, function parameters, or external data files.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to console, logs, or writes to files; potentially sends data over network if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks, potentially including network transmission or file writing.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials or secret keys are not explicitly visible, but look for dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns. No obvious anomalies detected from initial review, but code complexity or obscure constructs could hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code structure involves standard data processing functions with some use of dynamic features. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or suspicious file operations are immediately evident. The use of third-party libraries is benign; no malicious patterns like reverse shells, data exfiltration, or unauthorized network connections are apparent. The code appears well-structured with no obfuscation or unusual language features that suggest malicious intent. Without hidden or encrypted code, and considering the absence of suspicious network activity or system modifications, the risk of malicious behavior is low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the detailed review, the code does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious activity. It appears to be a standard data processing script with no evident security threats or supply chain sabotage. Confidence in this conclusion is high.",
