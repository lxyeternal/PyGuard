  "purpose": "Define package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point for the 'dmrid_lookup' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters: name, version, py_modules, install_requires, entry_points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no runtime data processing or user input handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration using setuptools, with static package info, dependencies, and CLI entry point. No dynamic code, user input, or data processing is present. Dependencies are common libraries ('requests', 'rich') and do not suggest malicious intent. The entry point references a function in an external module, but that is outside the scope of this static configuration. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's simplicity and adherence to conventions indicate no malicious or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and poses no security risks. All signals point to a safe package configuration with no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
