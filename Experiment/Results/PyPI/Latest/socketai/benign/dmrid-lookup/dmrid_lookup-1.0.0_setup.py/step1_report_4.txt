  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'dmrid_lookup', including its metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, dependencies, and entry point configuration.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; the setup process primarily defines package installation parameters.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is declarative configuration with no runtime data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package info, dependencies, and command-line interface entry point. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. Dependencies are common Python packages. No anomalies or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any runtime operations that could be malicious.",
