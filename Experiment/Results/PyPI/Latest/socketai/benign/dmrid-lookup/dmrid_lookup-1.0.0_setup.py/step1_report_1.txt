  "purpose": "This setup script defines the configuration for packaging and installing the Python module 'dmrid_lookup', including its dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data such as package name, version, module files, dependencies, and console entry points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data; the script mainly defines static setup parameters.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input or external data manipulation is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward, following standard setuptools practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry points. No user input handling, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The dependencies are common packages ('requests' and 'rich') which are widely used and not suspicious by themselves. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors. Overall, the code appears safe and standard for Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal, benign setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
