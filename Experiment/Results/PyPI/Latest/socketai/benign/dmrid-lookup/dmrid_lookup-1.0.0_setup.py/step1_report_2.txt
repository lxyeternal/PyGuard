  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration for packaging a Python module named 'dmrid_lookup', including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Import statement from setuptools; 'install_requires' list; 'entry_points' definition",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted input handling or data output shown in this snippet",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code is configuration, not execution logic",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "This code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python module. It specifies dependencies ('requests' and 'rich') and creates a command-line entry point 'dmrid_lookup'. There is no code execution, input reading, or data leakage here. No malicious patterns such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation are present. It appears to be a typical, benign setup configuration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
