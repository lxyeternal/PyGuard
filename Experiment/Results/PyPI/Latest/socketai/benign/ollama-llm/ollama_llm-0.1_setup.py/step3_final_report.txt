  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry point.",
  "sources": "Dependencies listed in 'install_requires' and the 'entry_points' script 'ollama_llm = ollama_llm:main'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'ollama_llm:main' when the console script is invoked.",
  "flows": "User runs 'ollama_llm' command -> invokes 'ollama_llm:main' function -> potential execution of arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The actual behavior depends on the implementation of 'ollama_llm:main', which is outside this script. The dependencies are common libraries. The entry point could execute arbitrary code, but this is expected in CLI tools. No malicious or suspicious code is present in this configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard. The primary security concern is the content of 'ollama_llm:main', which cannot be assessed here. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code. Overall, the package is safe to use from the setup perspective.",
