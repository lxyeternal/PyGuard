      "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard. The primary security concern is the content of 'ollama_llm:main', which cannot be assessed here. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code. Overall, the package is safe to use from the setup perspective."
