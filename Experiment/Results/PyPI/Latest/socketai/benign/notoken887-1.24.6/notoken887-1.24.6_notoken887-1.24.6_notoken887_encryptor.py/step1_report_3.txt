{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods for encoding and decoding strings by replacing characters with emoji symbols and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the encrypt() and decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "Output of the replace operations; no external data or untrusted sources are read or written.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed via character replacements in encrypt(); the reverse process occurs in decrypt().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code employs simple string replacement without external interactions. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward character substitutions to 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' strings using emoji mappings. There are no external data sources, network calls, or file operations involved. The replacement sequences are static and deterministic, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or suspicious operations. The implementation is consistent and simple, focused solely on character mapping. No signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign character-mapping utility for encoding and decoding strings using emoji substitutions. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. Its purpose appears to be aesthetic or obfuscation, not harmful activities.",
