{
  "purpose": "This code provides a simple character substitution cipher for encrypting and decrypting strings using emoji mappings.",
  "sources": "Input data to the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods, which take strings as arguments.",
  "sinks": "The output of the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods; no external data sinks or network transmission present.",
  "flows": "Input string is transformed through character replacements in 'encrypt'; encrypted string is transformed back in 'decrypt'.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses straightforward replacement methods; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two methods performing character substitution based on predefined emoji mappings. The approach is simple and stateless, with no external dependencies, network activity, or obfuscated code. There are no indications of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The use of string replacements is transparent and deterministic. Overall, the code appears to implement a basic obfuscation cipher rather than malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple substitution cipher for obfuscation purposes, with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. It does not perform any network, file, or credential operations. The risk is negligible, and the code appears benign.",
