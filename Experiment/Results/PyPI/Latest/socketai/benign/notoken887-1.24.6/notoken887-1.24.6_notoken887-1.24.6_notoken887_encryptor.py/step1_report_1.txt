{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple encoding and decoding (obfuscation) of strings by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input strings to encrypt() and encrypted tokens to decrypt()",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code only performs string replacements, no data leaks or external communications",
  "flows": "Input string -> encrypt() -> emoji substitution -> output; encrypted token -> decrypt() -> emoji substitution -> output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; straightforward character replacements with emojis. No external network access, no data exfiltration, no hidden code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs direct character replacements to encode and decode strings using emojis. No external calls, no dynamic code execution, and no data leaks are present. The implementation is a simple substitution cipher based on character-to-emoji mapping, with no apparent malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, simple encoding/decoding utility that transforms text into emojis and back. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
