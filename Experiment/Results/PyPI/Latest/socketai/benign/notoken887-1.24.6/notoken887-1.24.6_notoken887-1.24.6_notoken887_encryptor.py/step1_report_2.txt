{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple character substitution encryption and decryption methods for strings, converting alphabetic characters and periods into emoji tokens and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided via method parameters 'string' for encryption and 'encrypted_token' for decryption.",
  "sinks": "Output is the transformed string; no external sinks or data leakage points are directly present in this code.",
  "flows": "Input string is transformed by replacing characters with emojis (encryption); the encrypted string is transformed back to characters (decryption).",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward character replacements without any obfuscation, external data access, or hidden behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious actions are present. The code is highly predictable and uses only standard string operations.",
  "analysis": "The class is a simple substitution cipher using emoji mappings. It neither reads external data sources nor writes data to external systems. The replacements are static and defined explicitly, with no dynamic code execution, external network access, or obfuscated code segments. The code appears solely to convert characters to emoji tokens and back, serving a basic obfuscation or encoding purpose. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malware. The structure and logic are straightforward and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign character substitution encoding scheme with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a simple cipher for text obfuscation, with no evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
