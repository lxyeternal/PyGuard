{
  "purpose": "Simple character-to-emoji substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to encrypt() and encrypted tokens provided to decrypt().",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not read from or write to external systems, files, or network.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace characters with emojis (encrypt); Emoji string -> replace emojis with characters (decrypt).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static, straightforward replacements with no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs deterministic, static replacements for each character, serving as a basic substitution cipher. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The mappings are explicit and consistent, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The code is transparent and benign, with no vulnerabilities or malicious payloads. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: near 0, security risk: near 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static substitution cipher with no malicious behavior or security risks. The reports accurately reflect its harmless nature, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
