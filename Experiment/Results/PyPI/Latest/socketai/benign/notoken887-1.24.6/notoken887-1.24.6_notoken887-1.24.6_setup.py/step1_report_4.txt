  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python library named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Input data includes author name, email, description, and URL specified in setup() arguments.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no code execution or data leaks evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static parameters in setup() to package metadata; no dynamic or external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior; author email appears suspicious but is just metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, specifying package metadata. It does not contain code that reads external input or performs runtime actions. The author email 'hitler@gmail.com' is unusual and potentially offensive, but it is part of static metadata. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are evident. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with no malicious intent. It only defines package metadata for distribution. Despite the provocative email, there are no security risks or malware present.",
