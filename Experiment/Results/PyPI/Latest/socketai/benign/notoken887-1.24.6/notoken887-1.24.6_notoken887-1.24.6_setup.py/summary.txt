  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with suspicious metadata that does not constitute malicious behavior. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and a low security risk (~0.2-0.3) is appropriate due to the provocative contact details. Overall, the package is safe from a security perspective, though the metadata warrants caution for distribution."
