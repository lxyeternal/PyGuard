  "sources": "Environment variables, file/network operations, command-line arguments, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "File system, network connections, environment variables, command execution points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, args) to processing functions, potentially leading to network/file sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The malware scores are consistently 0, and obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code. The risk scores are mostly at 0.2, but given the benign analysis, lowering them to 0.1 across reports 2-5 would better reflect the minimal risk. Confidence levels are high where detailed reasoning is provided. No significant issues or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are accurate and well-reasoned, with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. Adjusting the risk scores from 0.2 to 0.1 for reports 2-5 would more precisely represent the low threat level. Overall, the dependency appears safe based on current analysis.",
