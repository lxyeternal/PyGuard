  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script or module intended for general execution or import, with no explicit documentation or comments indicating its specific purpose.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include user inputs, environment variables, external files, or network connections, though none are explicitly used in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network operations, file writes, subprocess calls, or data outputs, but no such operations are evident.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code does not process external input in a way that poses a risk.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and structurally normal.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly at all parts, including initial setup, core logic, and conclusion. No suspicious imports, data handling, or malicious patterns are present. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious by itself. The lack of comments or documentation limits understanding of intent but does not indicate maliciousness.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign and safe for use. The overall security risk score is low, with high confidence in this assessment.",
