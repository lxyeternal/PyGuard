  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their findings with the provided code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script using setuptools.\n- No dynamic code execution, untrusted data handling, or network activity is present.\n- The code reads the README.md file directly without validation, but this is typical and not malicious.\n- Dependencies are standard and relevant to the package's purpose.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Code Presence\n- The code matches the description: a typical `setup.py` using setuptools, reading `README.md`, specifying dependencies, author info, etc.\n- No issues with the code's presence or logic.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes\n- The only minor concern is reading `README.md` without error handling, which could cause a build failure if the file is missing. However, this is common practice and not malicious.\n- No other flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n### Scores Evaluation\n\n**Malware Score:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, network activity, or code injection.\n- No suspicious behaviors or payloads are present.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**\n- All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden code.\n\n**Risk Score:**\n- All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n- No security risks are identified, and the code is standard packaging code.\n\n### Justification for Scores > 0.5\n- None of the scores should be higher than 0.5; the code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The only point of potential concern is the lack of error handling when reading `README.md`, but this does not warrant a risk score increase; it's a common practice.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Assumptions\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No assumptions are made that are not supported by the code.\n- The reading of `README.md` is standard, not suspicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- The conclusion that the code is benign and standard is justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, well-structured setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified.",
