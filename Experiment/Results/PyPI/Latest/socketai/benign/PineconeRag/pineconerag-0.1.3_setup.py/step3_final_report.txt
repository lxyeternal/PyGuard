  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to configure packaging and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, importing dependencies, author info, package discovery via find_packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, no sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; static configuration without untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "Reading 'README.md' without error handling; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package locations. It reads the long description from a README file, which is standard practice. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. The dependencies are standard and relevant. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. The reading of 'README.md' without error handling is common but could be improved; however, it does not introduce security risks. Overall, the code is straightforward, benign, and aligns with best practices for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
