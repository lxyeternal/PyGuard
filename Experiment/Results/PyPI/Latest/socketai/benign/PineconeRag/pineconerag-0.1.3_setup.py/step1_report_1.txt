  "purpose": "Configure the packaging and installation setup for the PineconeRag Python project.",
  "sources": "Reading package dependencies, package directories, and package metadata (name, version, author, description, URL).",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; standard setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets (beyond typical metadata), or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and packaging instructions. It reads a README file for long description, specifies dependencies with version constraints, and includes author/contact info. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, no network activity, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code follows standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
