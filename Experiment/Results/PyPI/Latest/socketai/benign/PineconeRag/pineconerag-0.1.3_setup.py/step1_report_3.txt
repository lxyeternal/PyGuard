  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for configuring and installing the PineconeRag Python package, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading package dependencies, package directory, author info, and description from static variables and files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or user-controlled data sources; no data leaks or harmful actions detected.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration without external data flow or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools for a Python package. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package locations. The dependencies include common libraries like pinecone-client, sentence-transformers, and python-dotenv, which are used for vector search, NLP, and environment variable management respectively. There are no dynamic code executions, user input handling, or suspicious constructs present. The long_description is read from a README.md file, which is typical. The package metadata appears benign and consistent with common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical and benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
