{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'archerqueen' for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads package configuration data such as name, version, author, description, packages, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include untrusted data sources or potential sinks; it primarily sets up package metadata.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow involving untrusted input; it's static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The setup script appears straightforward and standard, with no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools functions and uses them to define package metadata and configuration. It specifies package name, version, author, description, packages to include, dependencies, Python version requirement, and console entry point. All elements are typical for a setup script and do not contain any malicious code or suspicious behavior. The absence of dependencies and the standard setup method reduce the likelihood of hidden malicious behavior. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a normal, benign package configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply specifies package metadata for distribution.",
