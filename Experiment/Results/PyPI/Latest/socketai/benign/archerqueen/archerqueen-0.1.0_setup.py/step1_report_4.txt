  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data propagation pathways identified in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard setup configuration with no unusual or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for packaging, defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for CLI commands. It appears to be a typical setup.py file with no malicious behaviors or security risks. The lack of dependencies or dynamic code reduces concern. No anomalous behavior or hidden backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign setup configuration script for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
