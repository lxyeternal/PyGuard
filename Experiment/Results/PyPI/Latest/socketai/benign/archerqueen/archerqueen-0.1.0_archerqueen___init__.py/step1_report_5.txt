  "purpose": "Initialize the package with a version identifier",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code",
  "sinks": "No sink operations, data outputs, or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow present",
  "anomalies": "Lack of functionality; extremely minimal code, no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code simply sets a version string variable within the package's __init__.py file. It contains no logic, no external data input, no network activity, no hardcoded credentials, and no dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation, and the code's simplicity indicates a standard package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as a package version declaration. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
