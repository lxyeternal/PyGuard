  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; no external data flows or network interactions",
  "flows": "N/A - simple assignment without data flow or external interactions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It contains no functions, data handling, external inputs, or dynamic code execution. All reports confirm the code's benign nature, with consistent scoring of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns justify the scores. No anomalies or malicious behavior are present. The code is standard package metadata with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization snippet with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
