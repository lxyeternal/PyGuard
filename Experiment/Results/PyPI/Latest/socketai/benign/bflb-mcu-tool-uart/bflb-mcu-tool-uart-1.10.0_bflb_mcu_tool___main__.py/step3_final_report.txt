  "purpose": "A minimal Python script serving as an entry point that delegates execution to an external module.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments via sys.argv, imported module core.bflb_mcu_tool",
  "sinks": "The external module's run() function, which may execute code based on input arguments",
  "flows": "sys.argv[1:] passed directly to bflb_mcu_tool.run() without validation or sanitization",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and lacks suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and a module, then calls the module's run() function with command-line arguments. It contains no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The security implications depend entirely on the external module's implementation, which is unknown. The code acts as a simple launcher, and no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident within this snippet. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code and the dependency on an external component. The overall assessment is that the code is safe, with minimal inherent risk, contingent on the trustworthiness of the external module.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward entry point delegating execution to an external module. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present within this code snippet. The security risk is very low, primarily dependent on the external module's integrity. The current scores are consistent and appropriate; no adjustments are necessary.",
