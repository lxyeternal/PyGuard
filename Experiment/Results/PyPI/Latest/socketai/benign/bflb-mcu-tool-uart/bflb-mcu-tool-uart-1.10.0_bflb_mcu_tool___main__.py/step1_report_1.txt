{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a simple entry point that invokes the 'run' function from the 'bflb_mcu_tool' module, passing command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1:] (reads command-line input), import of 'bflb_mcu_tool' module (potentially untrusted code if malicious).",
  "sinks": "bflb_mcu_tool.run (executes with user-supplied arguments), possibly executing code within 'bflb_mcu_tool' that could contain malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments flow into 'bflb_mcu_tool.run', which may process or execute untrusted data or code depending on its implementation.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code complexity; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets present. The 'bflb_mcu_tool' module's contents are unknown, which could be a concern if malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward launcher that delegates execution to a function in an external module. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activities are evident within this script itself. However, its security depends on the contents of 'bflb_mcu_tool', which is unknown. The code does not perform any unsafe operations directly. Since it relies on an external module, the trustworthiness of that module is crucial.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and does not exhibit malicious behavior by itself. Its security risk depends on the external 'bflb_mcu_tool' module. The code appears benign and standard as an entry point, with no obvious malware or security issues within this snippet.",
