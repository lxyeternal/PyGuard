{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a simple entry point that delegates execution to a function within the 'core.bflb_mcu_tool' module, passing command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Calls bflb_mcu_tool.run() with user-provided arguments",
  "flows": "sys.argv -> run() function in core.bflb_mcu_tool",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code structure is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and a specific module 'core.bflb_mcu_tool'. It defines a main function that calls run() from the imported module, passing command-line arguments. There is no direct data processing, no suspicious dynamic code execution, and no evident malicious behavior. The script functions solely as a command-line interface to the 'bflb_mcu_tool' module, which is external and not analyzed here.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code acts as a simple dispatcher for the external module. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious intent are detectable in this fragment.",
