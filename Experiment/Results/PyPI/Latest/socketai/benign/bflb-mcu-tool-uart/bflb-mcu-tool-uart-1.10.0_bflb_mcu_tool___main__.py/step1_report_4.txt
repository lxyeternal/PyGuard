{
  "purpose": "Delegates command-line arguments to a function in an imported module, likely for execution of a tool or script related to MCU operations.",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1:] (reads command-line input), import from core module",
  "sinks": "bflb_mcu_tool.run (executes with provided arguments)",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> run_main() -> bflb_mcu_tool.run()",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; the code is straightforward and minimal; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the sys module to access command-line arguments and a 'core' module containing 'bflb_mcu_tool'. The main function 'run_main' calls 'bflb_mcu_tool.run' with the command-line arguments (excluding the script name). The code follows a typical pattern for invoking external tools or modules with user-provided parameters. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The simplicity suggests it's a wrapper or launcher for MCU-related operations, potentially for firmware or hardware interaction, but nothing indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple launcher that passes command-line arguments to a core tool related to MCU operations. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
