  "flows": "Source: os.path.abspath(__file__) -> sys.path.append(lib_path)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code simply modifies sys.path to include its directory, which is common in Python projects.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules os and sys, determines the current script's directory, and appends it to sys.path for module importing. No input validation, no network access, and no suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a typical setup routine without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup snippet for including the script's directory in the module search path. No malicious activity or security issues are detected.",
