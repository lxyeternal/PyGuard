  "purpose": "The code sets up the environment by adding the script's directory to the Python module search path.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath(__file__), os.path.dirname()",
  "sinks": "sys.path.append()",
  "flows": "Retrieves current script directory -> appends to sys.path for module import paths",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a standard environment setup; no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by defining the file's directory path and then appends this path to sys.path, allowing for local module imports. It uses standard library functions with no external data inputs. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code appear present. The code is minimal and typical for setup routines in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign environment setup snippet commonly used to modify the module search path to include the current directory. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
