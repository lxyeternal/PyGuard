  "purpose": "The code sets up the environment by importing os and sys modules, determining the current script's directory, and adding it to the Python module search path.",
  "sources": "Reading the current script's file path using os.path and sys.path.append.",
  "sinks": "Modifying sys.path to include the script's directory, which could influence module loading behavior.",
  "flows": "os.path.abspath(__file__) -> os.path.dirname() -> sys.path.append()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs standard environment setup without obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it calculates the absolute path of the current script, extracts its directory, and appends that directory to sys.path. This is a common technique to ensure local modules are importable. No input data from external sources, no untrusted data handling, and no dynamic code execution or network operations are present. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior. It enhances module importability by adding the script's directory to the module search path. No security concerns identified.",
