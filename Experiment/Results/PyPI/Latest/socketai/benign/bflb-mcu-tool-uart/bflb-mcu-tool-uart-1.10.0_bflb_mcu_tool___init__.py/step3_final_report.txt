  "purpose": "Set up the environment by adding the current script's directory to sys.path for local module imports.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath(__file__), os.path.dirname(), sys.path.append()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved",
  "flows": "Retrieve current file path -> get directory -> append to sys.path",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward standard library usage with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries os and sys, determines the absolute path of the current script, extracts its directory, and appends this directory to sys.path. It performs a common setup routine with no dynamic code execution, external inputs, network activity, or obfuscation. The code's purpose is solely to facilitate local module imports. No malicious or security-risk behaviors are present. The code is simple, clear, and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment setup snippet with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reviews and scores are consistent and appropriate, indicating no security risks.",
