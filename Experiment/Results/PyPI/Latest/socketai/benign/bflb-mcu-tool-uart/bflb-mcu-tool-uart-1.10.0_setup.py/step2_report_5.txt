  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python project.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, or external data processing is present.\n- No obfuscated code, suspicious patterns, or anomalies are identified.\n- Dependencies are explicitly specified with fixed versions or ranges.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs are evident.\n- The long description is static documentation content.\n- Entry points and package data are straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies the script as a package setup.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No untrusted data or malicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Valid, straightforward, standard practices.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, confirms standard setup script with no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** All zero for malware and security risk, confidence=1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates the same, emphasizing no dynamic code, no network, no input handling.\n- **Scores:** All zero, confidence=1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion: standard setup script, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** All zero, confidence=1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also confirms no malicious behavior, standard configuration.\n- **Scores:** All zero, confidence=1.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis:\n- All reports are consistent and agree that the code is benign.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity is present.\n- The code is purely static configuration for packaging.\n- No obfuscation or malware signs.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the thorough analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard, safe setup script with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The detailed reasoning supports a zero risk assessment.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores as they are:  \n- **malware:** 0  \n- **obfuscated:** 0  \n- **risk:** 0",
