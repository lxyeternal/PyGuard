  "purpose": "Configuration and UI setup script for device firmware flashing/security tool, managing environment detection, static resources, and optional modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules (version, midea, aithinker, haier, aqara, logo, debug, changeconf), static embedded base64 images, file reading for version info, environment detection via sys and os.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no network activity, no command execution, no dynamic code evaluation, static assets only.",
  "flows": "Static imports and configuration variables initialized at startup; embedded images loaded; HTML content generated from static strings and variables; no runtime untrusted input processed.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no suspicious code flows, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution or injection points. The extensive static data and embedded images are benign assets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection, manages optional module imports, constructs static configuration data, and generates HTML UI content. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The embedded images are static assets, and the import fallback logic is standard. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration and UI setup module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
