{
  "purpose": "The code provides various functions to generate command strings for wireless communication protocols (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) and device configuration commands.",
  "sources": "Function inputs such as rate, preamble type, MCS, coding, channel, power, duty cycle, bandwidth, and other parameters.",
  "sinks": "Generated command strings returned by functions; no direct data sinks or untrusted data outputs observed.",
  "flows": "Inputs are transformed through formatting and conditional logic into command strings; no external data flows or untrusted data processing beyond function returns.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets; all functions straightforwardly format parameters into command strings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of functions that generate protocol or configuration command strings based on provided parameters. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data collection functions are present. The functions utilize simple string concatenation and formatting. The only notable aspect is the consistent structure and naming, indicating configuration or command generation rather than malicious activity. No signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms. The code appears to be a utility library for device communication or configuration, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for generating protocol commands. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It is a standard, straightforward implementation for command string formatting.",
