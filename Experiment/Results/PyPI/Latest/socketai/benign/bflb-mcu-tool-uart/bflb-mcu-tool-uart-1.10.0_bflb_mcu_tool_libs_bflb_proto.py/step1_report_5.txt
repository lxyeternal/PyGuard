  "purpose": "The code provides various functions for generating command strings for wireless device configuration and control, such as setting transmission power, channels, data rates, and modes.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (inputs) for various configuration settings like rate, channel, power, etc.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that produce command strings, which could potentially be sent to hardware or over a network.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are formatted and concatenated into command strings returned by functions; no external data or untrusted input flows into unsafe sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious hardcoded secrets are present. The code is straightforward in formatting command strings based on inputs. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of functions that generate specific command strings based on provided parameters. All functions perform simple string formatting and concatenation. There are no indications of data leaks, system calls, or network activity within this code snippet. No input validation or sanitization issues are evident, but the functions appear to be used for device configuration commands rather than handling untrusted user data directly. Overall, the code is standard for command string generation without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a collection of utility functions for creating command strings for wireless device configuration. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a straightforward, non-obfuscated implementation of command formatting functions.",
