{
  "purpose": "The code provides various functions to generate command strings for wireless communication protocols (e.g., Wi-Fi, BLE). These functions appear to construct protocol-specific commands or settings based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as rate, short_preamble, mcs, coding, heltf_gi, bw, tx_power, tx_channel, length_of_test_data, packet_payload, rx_channel, channel, dbm, duty, len, tick, enable, time_ms, time_sec, dtim, exit_cnt.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly process or execute untrusted data; they only format and return command strings based on inputs. No apparent sink that leads to data leak, code injection, or malicious action.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions and are used to generate command strings. No data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; functions are simple string formatters.",
  "anomalies": "All functions are straightforward string formatting utilities with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No suspicious network activity or backdoors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of functions that generate specific command strings for wireless communication hardware or software configuration. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions are consistent in purpose, and no unusual patterns or obfuscation are present. The functions accept parameters and return formatted strings, typical for device command protocols.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a collection of utility functions for generating protocol command strings. There is no sign of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this module. The functions are simple and well-structured, serving a legitimate purpose in wireless communication configuration. The overall security risk is very low.",
