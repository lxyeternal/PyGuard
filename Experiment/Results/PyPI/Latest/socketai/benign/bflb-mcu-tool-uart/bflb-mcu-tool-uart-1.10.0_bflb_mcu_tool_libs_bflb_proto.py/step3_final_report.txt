  "purpose": "Generate command strings for wireless protocols, BLE, power settings, and device configuration.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as rate, preamble, mcs, coding, heltf_gi, bw, channel, power, duty, frequency, enable flags, and other configuration values.",
  "sinks": "String outputs that are likely sent to hardware or communication modules; no external data sinks or untrusted data processing detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into string formatting functions, producing command strings for device configuration; no dynamic code execution or data manipulation beyond string concatenation.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. The code is straightforward and lacks any obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple utility functions that generate command strings for wireless device configuration, BLE, power settings, and other device parameters. Each function performs simple string formatting based on input parameters, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The functions serve as command generators, likely for hardware communication, and do not exhibit malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of utility functions for generating device command strings. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1). The code is safe for use and does not pose security concerns.",
