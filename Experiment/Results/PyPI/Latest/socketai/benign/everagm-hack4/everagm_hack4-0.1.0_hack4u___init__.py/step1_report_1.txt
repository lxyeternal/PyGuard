{
  "purpose": "Define package namespace and manage imports within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'from .courses import *' and 'from .utils import *'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially importing all symbols into the namespace, but no direct sinks of untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs static import operations without data flow or external input handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported content, but this is a common pattern in package __init__.py files. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative import statements within a package, aiming to expose modules 'courses' and 'utils' at the package level. There are no external inputs, network operations, or suspicious code constructs. The use of wildcard imports can be risky in larger modules but is typical in package __init__.py files to simplify imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package __init__.py file setting up namespace imports. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The use of 'import *' is a potential concern for namespace pollution but not malicious.",
