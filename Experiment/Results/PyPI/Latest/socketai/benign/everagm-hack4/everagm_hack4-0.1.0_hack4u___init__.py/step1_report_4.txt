  "purpose": "Define package imports for a Python project, facilitating simplified import statements within the package.",
  "sources": "The import statements: 'from .courses import *' and 'from .utils import *'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; import statements do not create data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can be considered a questionable practice but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative import statements to include 'courses' and 'utils' modules within the package namespace. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious data handling. The comments explain the intent but do not introduce any malicious behavior. The use of wildcard imports may lead to namespace pollution but is not a security concern per se.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply configures module imports for convenience. No malware or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
