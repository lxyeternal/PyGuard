  "purpose": "Define package namespace; import modules 'courses' and 'utils' for easier access.",
  "sources": "Relative import statements: 'from .courses import *' and 'from .utils import *'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external inputs involved.",
  "flows": "Imports modules into package namespace; no data flow beyond module exposure.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can cause namespace pollution; no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py file for a Python package, importing submodules with relative imports. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The use of 'import *' is common in such files but can lead to namespace pollution; however, it does not constitute a security risk. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the minimal concern about namespace pollution, which is a style and maintenance issue rather than a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup file with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor namespace pollution concern does not translate into a security risk. The scores are consistent with the analysis and should remain as is.",
