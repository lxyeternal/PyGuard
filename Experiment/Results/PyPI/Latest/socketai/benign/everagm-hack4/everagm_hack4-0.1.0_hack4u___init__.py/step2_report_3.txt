  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a package `__init__.py` file that performs relative imports of modules `courses` and `utils`.\n- The code uses `from .courses import *` and `from .utils import *`.\n- No report indicates any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data.\n- The main concern raised is the use of wildcard imports (`*`), which can cause namespace pollution but are common in package `__init__.py` files for convenience.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code is observed.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- The actual code matches the description in all reports.\n- No suspicious or malicious code is present.\n- The code does not perform any operations beyond importing modules.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe issues reported (use of `import *`, potential namespace pollution) are valid concerns but do not indicate malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as a standard package initialization pattern.\n- They correctly note that no external inputs or untrusted data are involved.\n- The concern about `import *` is valid but common in such files; it’s not a security risk per se.\n\n**No significant logical flaws or mistakes are apparent.**\n\n---\n\n### Score review and justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 in some reports, mainly due to the use of `import *`. Given the context, this is a minor concern rather than a security risk.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- The overall security risk is minimal; a score of **0.1** is reasonable, reflecting a minor concern about namespace pollution but not a security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final challenge: Estimating scores based on the entire analysis:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minor namespace pollution concern, no actual security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a standard package `__init__.py` file with relative imports.\n- No malicious activity, no data leaks, no external inputs.\n- The main concern is the use of `import *`, which is a common pattern in such files but can cause namespace pollution.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a benign, standard package setup with a minor style concern.",
