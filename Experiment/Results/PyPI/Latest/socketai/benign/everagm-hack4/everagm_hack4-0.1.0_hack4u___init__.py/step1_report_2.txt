{
  "purpose": "Defines package imports for the 'hack4u' Python package, enabling simplified access to submodules.",
  "sources": "The code reads from local module files '.courses' and '.utils' within the package directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no external input or output operations are performed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports (from .module import *) is standard in package definitions; no suspicious or unusual behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements that include relative imports from local modules within the package. This is typical for Python package structure to facilitate modularity and ease of use. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration. The comments clarify intent but do not impact security. Overall, the code appears to be a standard package initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward package setup with relative imports. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It functions to expose internal modules for easier access without involving external or harmful operations.",
