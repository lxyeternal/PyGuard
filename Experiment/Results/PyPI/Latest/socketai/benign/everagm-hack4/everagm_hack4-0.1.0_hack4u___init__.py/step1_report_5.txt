{
  "purpose": "Define the package's directory structure and facilitate relative imports within the package.",
  "sources": "The import statements: 'from .courses import *' and 'from .utils import *'.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported modules could lead to execution of code, but no direct untrusted data handling is present in the snippet.",
  "flows": "The package imports modules relative to its directory, enabling simplified access to submodules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can obscure the source of functions or variables and may be considered bad practice, but it does not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up relative imports for 'courses' and 'utils' modules within the package, enabling simplified access when the package is imported. No input sources, network connections, or untrusted data handling is evident. The code does not perform any data processing, network operations, or file handling. The use of wildcard imports could be a maintenance concern but is not malicious. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code primarily serves to set up package imports using relative paths. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on this snippet alone.",
