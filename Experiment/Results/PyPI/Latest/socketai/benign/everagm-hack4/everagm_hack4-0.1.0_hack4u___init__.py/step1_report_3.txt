{
  "purpose": "Define package imports for a Python project, allowing simplified access to modules within the package.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules 'courses' and 'utils' using relative imports.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports is standard in package structure; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains comments and relative import statements for modules within the package. It facilitates user-friendly imports but does not execute any dynamic code, network access, or contain hidden behaviors. No malicious indicators, such as code injection or data exfiltration, are present. The comments clarify intended usage but do not influence runtime behavior maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, providing package import directives with no malicious or security risk indications. It appears to be normal package setup code.",
