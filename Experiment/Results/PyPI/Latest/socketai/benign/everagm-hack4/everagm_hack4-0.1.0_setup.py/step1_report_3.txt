  "purpose": "To set up and configure a Python package for distribution on PyPI, including reading a README file for the package description.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file to get long description; no other data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; the code only performs setup operations.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> Passes data to setup() -> Completes installation setup; no untrusted data flow or external actions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; standard setup script with straightforward package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a typical package setup process: importing setup functions, reading a documentation file, and calling setup() with package details. No dynamic code execution, external data manipulation, or hidden behaviors are present. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are detected. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
