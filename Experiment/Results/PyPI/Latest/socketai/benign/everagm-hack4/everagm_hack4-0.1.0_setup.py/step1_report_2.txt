  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package to be uploaded to PyPI, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description, static package configuration in 'setup()'.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data or external system calls that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content as input, then passing static parameters to 'setup()'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard 'setuptools' for package setup, reads a markdown file for description, and defines static metadata such as name, version, author, and URL. No user input, external commands, or potentially malicious behavior present. The script appears to be a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script for publishing a Python package. No malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
