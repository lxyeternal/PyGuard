  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads README.md and configures package metadata for distribution on PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file; static metadata in setup() call",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; no data leaks or external connections",
  "flows": "Reading file -> passing static data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, static code with no dynamic or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a static README.md file to set the long description and calls setup() with fixed, hardcoded metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code does not involve user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm its safety and standard use case.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious intent or security issues. All assessments and scores are justified and consistent with the code content.",
