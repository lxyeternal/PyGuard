  "purpose": "To configure and set up a Python package for distribution on PyPI, including reading a README file for the long description.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file to obtain long description data.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function which registers package metadata and dependencies; no untrusted data handling beyond reading a static file.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> long_description variable -> setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for package setup. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setuptools functions, reads a markdown file, and invokes setup() with package metadata. No user input, network activity, or execution of dynamic or untrusted code. The comments are in Spanish, explaining the purpose of the file, but contain no malicious content. All variables are static, and no suspicious behaviors such as code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious dependencies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical setup configuration file for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package setup script.",
