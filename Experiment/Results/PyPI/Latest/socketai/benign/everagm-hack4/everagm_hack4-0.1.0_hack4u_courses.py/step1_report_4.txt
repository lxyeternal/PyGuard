{
  "purpose": "Define a Course class with properties and manage a list of course objects with search functionality.",
  "sources": "Input data includes course attributes (name, duration, link) passed during object creation and the course list defined in the code.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from search_course_by_name and __repr__ method, mainly for display; no untrusted data is sent externally.",
  "flows": "Input attributes -> Course object properties -> list_courses() returns list -> search_course_by_name() searches by name -> returns Course object or None -> __repr__ used for display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward and self-contained.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Course class with private attributes, accessed and modified via properties, and includes a list of predefined Course instances. The functions list_courses() and search_course_by_name() operate on this list to retrieve data based on course name. There are no external input sources, no network operations, no dynamic code execution, nor any signs of malicious behavior. The code appears to be a simple data structure and retrieval implementation with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a data model for courses with search capabilities. No malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks identified.",
