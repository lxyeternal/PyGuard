{
  "purpose": "Define a Course class and manage a list of course objects with search functionality.",
  "sources": "Input data: course attributes during object creation, search parameter 'name' in the function search_course_by_name.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effect occur if untrusted input is used improperly, but here input is static and from function parameters; no external untrusted sources are involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' flows into search_course_by_name, which compares it with course.name properties; no other data flow manipulates untrusted data or leads to security-sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code uses standard class definitions, properties, and list management. No obfuscated code or unsafe operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple Course class with private attributes, property getters and setters, and a __repr__ method. It creates a static list of three courses with fixed URLs and attributes. The function list_courses returns this static list, and search_course_by_name searches for a course matching a given name. There are no dynamic external inputs, no network operations, no database access, and no code execution or external data fetching. The code appears straightforward and intended for course data management without any malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data structure setup for managing course information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It operates solely on static data and function parameters with no external or untrusted input manipulation.",
