  "purpose": "Define a Course class with properties and a list of course objects; provides functions to list and search courses by name.",
  "sources": "Input data: course details in the Course constructor; data from the list 'courses'.",
  "sinks": "Return values of functions, particularly the 'search_course_by_name' function which returns course objects.",
  "flows": "The 'search_course_by_name' function reads course names and compares to input, returning course objects. The '__repr__' method formats course info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network calls, no obfuscated code. The code is straightforward with no malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with private attributes, setters, and getters, and provides functions to list and search courses. The search function performs simple comparison without external inputs or unsafe operations. The __repr__ method outputs course info. There are no apparent security issues, malicious behaviors, or anomalies. The code's structure and formatting are standard. No signs of malware, data leakage, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data container for course information with search capabilities. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are detected.",
