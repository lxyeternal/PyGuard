{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Course class with encapsulated attributes and static course data, providing search functionality.",
  "sources": "Static list of Course objects, attributes within the class",
  "sinks": "No external data inputs, network activity, or untrusted data sources",
  "flows": "Static data within objects; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Minor formatting typo in __repr__ method (extraneous bracket), not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no external inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. It uses standard class encapsulation and static data. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The formatting issue in __repr__ is a minor syntax mistake, not security-related. The search functions operate on static data, with no external or untrusted data involved. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static data container with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor formatting typo does not impact security. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with appropriate scoring. The supply chain risk from this code is negligible.",
