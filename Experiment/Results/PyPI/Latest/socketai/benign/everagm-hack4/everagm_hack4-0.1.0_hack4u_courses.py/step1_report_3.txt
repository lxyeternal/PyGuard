{
  "purpose": "Define a Course class with encapsulation and provide functions to list and search courses.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'courses' list and user input parameter 'name' in the search_course_by_name function.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the search_course_by_name function could be used to retrieve specific course data, but it does not output or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' in search_course_by_name flows through a comparison to course.name in the list to return a course object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward; no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The class encapsulates course data with private attributes and property setters/getters, following standard practices. The list 'courses' is a simple collection of Course objects. The function list_courses() returns this list, and search_course_by_name() searches for a course by name. All code performs benign data handling without external communication, file I/O, or network activity. There are no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behaviors. The code appears to be a typical data management implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data structure setup for course information with basic search functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward.",
