{
  "purpose": "Defines a Course class with properties and methods to manage course information, including a list of courses and search functionality.",
  "sources": "Input data: course attributes (name, duration, link) during object creation, and the name parameter in search_course_by_name.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs, network connections, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into object attributes; search function reads the name parameter and accesses course list to find matches.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors observed. No hardcoded credentials or hidden code. The __repr__ method has an extraneous bracket at the end but this is a formatting issue, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward class with encapsulation via private attributes and property accessors. The list of courses is static, hardcoded, and there are no external data inputs or network communications. The search function iterates over the list to find a course matching the given name. No malicious or suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or data leaks are present. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign implementation for managing and searching course data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
