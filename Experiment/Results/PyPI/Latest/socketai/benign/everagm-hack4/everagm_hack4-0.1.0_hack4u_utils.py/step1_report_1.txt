{
  "purpose": "Calculate the total duration by summing durations of course objects imported from a module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'courses' from a local module './courses'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; the code only performs a sum operation on course objects.",
  "flows": "The function accesses 'courses' and iterates over each 'course' to access 'course.duration'.",
  "anomalies": "The import uses a relative path, which could be suspicious if the module is maliciously altered, but this alone is not inherently malicious. The code is simple and straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a list of course objects from a local module and defines a function to sum their 'duration' attribute. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The only potential concern is the use of a relative import, which could be manipulated if the module './courses' is compromised, but this is not evidence of malicious intent by itself. The code appears to perform a benign calculation with no suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and functional, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard pattern for summing object attributes, assuming the 'courses' module is trustworthy.",
