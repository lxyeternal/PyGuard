  "purpose": "Calculate the total duration by summing the 'duration' attribute of each course object in the imported 'courses' list.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'courses' from a local module; iteration over 'courses' list to access 'duration' attribute.",
  "sinks": "Summation operation which could be affected if 'courses' contains malicious objects or corrupted data.",
  "flows": "The code reads the 'courses' list and accesses 'course.duration' for each course, then sums these values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. The import is from a relative module, which is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'courses' list from a local module, then defines a function that sums the 'duration' attribute of each course. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, file manipulation, or obfuscation. The use of a relative import is normal in package structures. The code appears straightforward and safe, assuming 'courses' contains valid course objects with numeric 'duration' attributes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple and typical implementation for summing course durations. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. The import and usage patterns are standard. Overall, the code is safe.",
