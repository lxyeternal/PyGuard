  "purpose": "Summing the 'duration' attribute of course objects imported from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import from '.courses' module, reading 'courses' list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only performs a sum operation on in-memory objects.",
  "flows": "Import source ('.courses') -> iteration over 'courses' -> summing 'course.duration'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import path; no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward function that sums the 'duration' attribute of course objects imported from a local module. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. The only minor concern is the relative import path, which could be a supply chain vector if the module is compromised, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence levels are high, reflecting the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and performs a basic summation. There is no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. The primary concern is the supply chain integrity of the imported module, not the code itself. Overall, the code is safe with minimal supply chain risk.",
