  "purpose": "Calculate the total duration of all courses imported from a module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'courses' from a local module '.courses'.",
  "sinks": "Sum function iterating over 'courses' and accessing 'course.duration'.",
  "flows": "Accessing 'courses' leads to iterating over each course object and retrieving its 'duration' property.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed. The import source is relative, which is normal in some projects but could be risky if misused; however, on its own, it is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a list of course objects from a local module, then defines a function that sums the 'duration' attribute of each course. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of data leakage, malicious data processing, or malicious behavior. The import is relative, which could be normal depending on the project structure, but does not suggest malicious intent. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, legitimate calculation of total course durations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
