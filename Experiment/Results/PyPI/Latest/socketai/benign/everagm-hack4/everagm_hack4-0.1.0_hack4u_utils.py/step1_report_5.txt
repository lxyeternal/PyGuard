  "purpose": "Calculate the total duration of courses by summing their 'duration' attribute.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .courses import courses",
  "sinks": "sum() function that processes course.duration",
  "flows": "Imported 'courses' list is iterated over; each course's 'duration' attribute is accessed and summed",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The import path is relative, which is standard in packages, but could be scrutinized in supply chain context.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a list of course objects from a relative module. It then defines a function that sums the 'duration' attribute of each course in the list. There are no external inputs, no suspicious code execution, and no data leaks. The code appears straightforward and legitimate. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The only potential concern is the use of a relative import, which is common but could be misused in compromised packages. Overall, the logic is clear, and the code's purpose is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, legitimate utility function to compute total course duration. No malware or malicious intent detected. The code appears safe but should be reviewed in the context of the overall package integrity.",
