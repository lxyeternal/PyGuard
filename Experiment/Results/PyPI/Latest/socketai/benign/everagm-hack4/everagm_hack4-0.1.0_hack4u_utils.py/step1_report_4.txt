{
  "purpose": "Calculate the total duration of courses by summing the 'duration' attribute of each course object in the imported 'courses' list.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .courses import courses' which loads the 'courses' list; iteration over 'courses' in the 'total_duration' function.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling present; the function simply processes data already imported.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported 'courses' list through the iteration in 'total_duration' to the sum calculation, with no external input or output affecting system state.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The import statement is relative, but that alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to sum the 'duration' attribute of objects in a list imported from a relative module. It performs simple data aggregation without any external input, network communication, or system modifications. There are no signs of malicious intent such as hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. The only potential concern is the source of 'courses,' but the code itself does not demonstrate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a straightforward purpose of aggregating course durations. There are no indications of malware or malicious behavior within this snippet.",
