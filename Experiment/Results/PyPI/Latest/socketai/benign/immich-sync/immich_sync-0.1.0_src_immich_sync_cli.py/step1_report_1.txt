  "purpose": "CLI tool to synchronize an Immich album to a local directory, using a config file or command-line options.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files, command-line arguments, environment variables indirectly through load_config, and user input via CLI options.",
  "sinks": "Uses the config parameters to call sync_album, which likely interacts with remote servers and filesystem.",
  "flows": "Loads config -> Merges CLI args -> Validates -> Calls sync_album",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles configuration loading, merging input parameters, validation, and invoking a sync process. It uses standard libraries and straightforward error handling. No data is being transmitted outside of the intended sync function. There are no evident points where untrusted data could lead to code injection or data leaks within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard CLI wrapper for a sync operation. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks are evident in this fragment. The overall security posture relies on the correctness and security of the 'load_config' and 'sync_album' functions, which are not provided here.",
