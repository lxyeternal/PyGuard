  "purpose": "CLI tool to sync an Immich album to a local directory, configurable via command-line options or a config file.",
  "sources": "User-provided command-line options (--config, --url, --apikey, --photodir, --album, --raw), configuration file loaded via load_config, environment variables (if any used in load_config), input data from config file and CLI arguments.",
  "sinks": "Configuration object creation (Config), sync_album function call, sys.exit, click.echo for output messages.",
  "flows": "CLI inputs -> loading config file -> merging parameters -> creating Config object -> invoking sync_album.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No suspicious network calls or data leaks observed. Use of external libraries appears standard for CLI tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script reads user input via command-line options and optionally a config file. It performs validation and error handling. The load_config and sync_album functions are imported from other modules; their contents are not provided, which limits analysis of their behavior. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic detected. No indications of malicious payloads, system manipulation, or data exfiltration within this script. The code strictly manages configuration parameters and orchestrates a sync process without unsafe or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard CLI wrapper for syncing albums with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It handles user input, configuration, and calls external functions presumed to perform the core sync operation. No malicious behavior or malware signals detected.",
