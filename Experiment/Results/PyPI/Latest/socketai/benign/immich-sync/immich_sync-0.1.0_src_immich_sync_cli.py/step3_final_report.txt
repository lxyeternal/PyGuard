  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for syncing an Immich album, handling configuration loading, merging CLI and file parameters, validation, and invoking sync.",
  "sources": "Reads CLI options, configuration file if exists, and environment variables (indirectly via load_config).",
  "sinks": "Calls external functions load_config and sync_album; no direct sinks within this code.",
  "flows": "Source: CLI options or config file -> merge into final parameters -> validate -> create Config object -> call sync_album.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface with proper validation and error handling. It does not perform any network activity, data leaks, or execute untrusted code within this fragment. External functions are assumed safe but are critical points for security. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure CLI wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk scores are justified, and malware scores remain at zero. External dependencies' security should be verified separately.",
