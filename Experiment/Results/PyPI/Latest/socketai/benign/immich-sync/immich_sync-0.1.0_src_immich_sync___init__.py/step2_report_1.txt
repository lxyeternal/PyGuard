  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external data reads, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is typical for a package's `__init__.py` file to specify versioning.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior**:\n   - No report indicates any suspicious activity, such as code obfuscation, external resource access, or malicious logic.\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Error, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:\n   - The reports are accurate; no errors or flaws are present.\n   - The reasoning that this is benign and standard practice is correct.\n\n4. **Scores and Their Justification**:\n   - All reports assign a `malware` score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are also 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - The `obfuscated` scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The confidence levels are 1, reflecting high certainty.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports assume that assigning a version string is harmless, which is valid.\n   - No claims are made about hidden malicious behavior, which is correct given the code snippet.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency**:\n   - The scores and reasoning are consistent across all reports.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- The code is straightforward, benign, and typical for package initialization.\n- The scores of `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, and `securityRisk=0` are appropriate.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThis code snippet presents no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns well with the code's nature.",
