  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code snippet is a straightforward assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions. The code is minimal and standard for package initialization.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. This is accurate given the code snippet.\n   - They correctly identify the absence of data flows, sinks, or sources.\n   - The analyses are consistent and correctly interpret the purpose of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate since there's no malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct as the code is clear and not obfuscated.\n   - The security risk score is 0, aligning with the analysis that the code is benign.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   - No issues in the code justify a higher risk score. All reports agree on this, assigning 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   - Correctly assigned as 0 in all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment**:  \n- The code is a simple, standard `__init__.py` snippet setting a version string.  \n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.  \n- Scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate.\n\n**My Own Estimate**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the assigned scores reflect that appropriately.",
