{
  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable for package identification.",
  "sources": "Static assignment in the __init__.py file; no external data reads or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment without data movement or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and typical for package versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string to __version__, with no inputs, outputs, or external interactions. It is a minimal, standard practice for Python package initialization. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious activity is present. The code's simplicity and purpose are clear, and the absence of dynamic or external code reduces security concerns. All signals indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package version declaration with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate, and the confidence level is high (1).",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
