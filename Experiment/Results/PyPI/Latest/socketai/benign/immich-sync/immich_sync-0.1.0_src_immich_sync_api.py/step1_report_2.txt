{
  "purpose": "This code defines an asynchronous API client for interacting with the Immich API, primarily to list albums, retrieve album details, fetch asset information, and fetch asset size.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the parameters such as base_url, api_key, album_id, and asset_id passed into the methods.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially come from the API responses (e.g., JSON data from the server). The code does not directly execute or evaluate this data but processes it.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to API requests, then to JSON parsing or header reading, with retries on network failures; no dangerous data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for an async API client; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. It properly handles retries with exponential backoff. No obfuscated code or suspicious URL manipulations are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical async API client implementation using aiohttp, with proper exception handling, retries, and no suspicious or malicious behavior. It manages API keys via headers and constructs URLs dynamically from method parameters, which is standard. There are no signs of code injection, data leaks, or malicious network activity. It does not perform any file system modifications, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors. The only potential concern could be if the 'api_key' or 'base_url' parameters are maliciously supplied, but this is outside the scope of static analysis here.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It adheres to common async programming practices for API access. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
