{
  "purpose": "Provides an asynchronous API client for interacting with the Immich API, fetching albums, asset info, and asset size.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET and HEAD requests to URLs constructed from the base URL and IDs (albums, assets).",
  "sinks": "Untrusted input (album_id, asset_id) used directly in URL paths; JSON data returned from API responses.",
  "flows": "Input IDs -> URL construction -> HTTP requests -> JSON response or headers -> return data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual code patterns. Uses retries with exponential backoff but nothing suspicious about that.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward async API client using aiohttp, with proper use of headers and retries. It does not perform any data leakage, system commands, or malicious network activity. There are no signs of backdoors, hidden data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The use of API keys in headers is typical, and the data flows are limited to standard API interactions. No suspicious or malicious code behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client for interacting with an external service, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It securely handles input parameters and uses standard patterns for network requests and retries.",
