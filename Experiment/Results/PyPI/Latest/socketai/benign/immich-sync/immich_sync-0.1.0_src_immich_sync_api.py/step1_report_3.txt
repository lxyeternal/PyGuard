{
  "purpose": "The code provides an API client for interacting with an Immich server, allowing listing albums, fetching album details, asset information, and asset size.",
  "sources": "Reads API key from constructor; reads URLs, album IDs, asset IDs from function parameters; reads headers and URL strings.",
  "sinks": "Performs HTTP GET and HEAD requests, potentially exposing data if URLs or parameters are manipulated; uses API key in headers which, if compromised, could grant access.",
  "flows": "Inputs (API key, URLs, IDs) flow into HTTP requests which retrieve JSON data or headers, but no data flows into other parts of the system or external storage.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious or obfuscated code; no unusual or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs URLs dynamically based on input parameters and performs HTTP requests to a specified base URL with an API key. It uses retries with exponential backoff for network resilience. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The API key is supplied externally, reducing internal risk. No code injection, malicious payloads, or unsafe data handling detected. It relies on standard asyncio and aiohttp features without obfuscation. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward API client with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a secure and typical API client for interacting with an Immich server. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified. It performs expected network requests with retry logic. No signs of malware or security risks.",
