{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for managing image files in a directory, specifically deleting orphan files and computing file checksums.",
  "sources": "The code reads filenames from the specified directory and reads file contents to compute checksums.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to the filesystem via f.unlink() and reads files for checksum calculation.",
  "flows": "The code reads directory contents to identify files, then optionally deletes files; it also reads file data for checksum computation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The functions perform typical file operations. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The delete_orphans function safely removes files not listed in valid_ids, which is a standard directory management practice. The compute_checksum function calculates a SHA1 hash of a file's contents and encodes it in base64, which is a common checksum operation. Both functions use standard libraries and straightforward logic without dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs. No external network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious intent is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve legitimate purposes related to file management and integrity verification. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is simple, transparent, and does not contain any suspicious or harmful patterns.",
