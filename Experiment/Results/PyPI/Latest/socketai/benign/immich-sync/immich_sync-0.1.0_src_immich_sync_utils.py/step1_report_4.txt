{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to delete files not matching a list of valid IDs and to compute SHA1 checksums of files, likely for validation or integrity checks.",
  "sources": "File reading in compute_checksum function; directory iteration in delete_orphans function.",
  "sinks": "File deletion with f.unlink() in delete_orphans; checksum computation and encoding in compute_checksum.",
  "flows": "delete_orphans reads file names to determine deletions; compute_checksum reads file content to generate hash.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated code. No unusual behavior or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file operations: deleting files not in a valid list and calculating SHA1 checksums with base64 encoding. Both functions use standard libraries and methods. There is no evidence of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The operations are typical for file validation and cleanup processes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing common file handling and checksum calculations without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware indications are evident.",
