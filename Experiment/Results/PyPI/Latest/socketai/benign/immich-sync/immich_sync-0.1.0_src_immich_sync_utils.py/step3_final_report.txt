  "purpose": "Utility functions for deleting files not in a valid list and computing SHA1 checksum of files encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads in 'photodir.iterdir()', file open in 'compute_checksum()'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Directory listing to file deletion; file reading to checksum calculation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file management and checksum calculation using hashlib and base64. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. SHA1 is outdated but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The functions are utility in nature, with no network activity or data leaks. The code's logic is clear, and the operations are safe under normal circumstances.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for file cleanup and checksum computation, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate due to the use of SHA1, but overall, the code poses minimal security concerns.",
