{
  "purpose": "This code loads and validates configuration data for an application interacting with an 'immich' service.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from a file specified by 'path'. Accesses specific keys within the 'immich' section of the config file.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly. No untrusted data is processed in a way that leads to system commands, network calls, or sensitive data leakage within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Reads config file -> parses 'immich' section -> validates keys -> constructs Config object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs standard configuration loading and validation without any suspicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration data from a file, verifies the presence and correctness of required parameters, and creates a Config object. It includes standard validation for URL format, non-empty API keys and album names, and directory creation. No hardcoded secrets (beyond expected API key), suspicious file operations, or malicious behaviors are evident. No external or network calls are made. The code’s logic is straightforward and aligns with typical configuration handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration loader with proper validation and no signs of malicious behavior. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. It appears safe for its intended purpose.",
