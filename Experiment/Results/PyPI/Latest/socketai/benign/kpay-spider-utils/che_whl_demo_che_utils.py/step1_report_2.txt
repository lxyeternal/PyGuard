  "purpose": "The function pppprint concatenates a fixed string 'che' with input text and prints it. Its purpose appears to be simple output formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the parameter 'text' passed to the pppprint function.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the print statement, which outputs concatenated data to the console.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input parameter 'text' through string concatenation to the print statement, resulting in output.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward. It defines a single function that prints a concatenation of a fixed string with user-provided input. There are no suspicious or malicious elements such as network activity, secret data handling, or obfuscated logic. The code's simplicity indicates it performs a benign output operation without side effects or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, performing basic string concatenation and output. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
