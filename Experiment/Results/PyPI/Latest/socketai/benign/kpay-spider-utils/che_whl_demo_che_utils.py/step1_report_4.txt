  "flows": "Input 'text' flows into the print statement after being concatenated with a prefix",
  "anomalies": "The function prepends 'che' to any input text before printing; no suspicious or malicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that takes a text argument and prints it with a fixed prefix. No external data sources, network activity, or file operations are present. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are visible. The function's behavior is straightforward and benign, simply outputting a string with a prefix.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless and serves a basic print functionality with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
