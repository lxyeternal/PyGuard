{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to generate SQL statements for creating tables, inserting data (single and batch), and updating records in a PostgreSQL database.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as table_name, insert_item, up_item, and condition, which are supplied externally and used directly in string formatting.",
  "sinks": "The generated SQL strings that could be executed in a database context, potentially leading to SQL injection if inputs are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into string formatting functions, with minimal escaping, directly constructing SQL commands without validation or parameterization.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies on basic string replacement for escaping single quotes but does not sanitize or validate 'table_name', 'condition', or other parameters, which could be exploited for SQL injection if inputs are malicious.",
  "analysis": "The functions are straightforward SQL statement generators with minimal escaping. They do not execute code or contain obfuscated/malicious code. The primary security concern is that 'condition', 'table_name', and other parameters are embedded directly into SQL strings without validation, creating potential injection points if inputs are untrusted. The code does not use parameterized queries, which is a best practice for security. No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the potential for injection vulnerabilities if external validation is absent. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9), given the code's simplicity and the consistent findings across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SQL utility module with no malicious intent or obfuscation. Its main security risk stems from external input validation issues, not from malicious code within. The assigned malware score of 0 and a low security risk score of about 0.2 are appropriate, assuming inputs are sanitized externally. To improve security, parameterized queries should be used, and validation of 'table_name' and 'condition' should be enforced before usage.",
