  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SQL utility module with no malicious intent or obfuscation. Its main security risk stems from external input validation issues, not from malicious code within. The assigned malware score of 0 and a low security risk score of about 0.2 are appropriate, assuming inputs are sanitized externally. To improve security, parameterized queries should be used, and validation of 'table_name' and 'condition' should be enforced before usage."
