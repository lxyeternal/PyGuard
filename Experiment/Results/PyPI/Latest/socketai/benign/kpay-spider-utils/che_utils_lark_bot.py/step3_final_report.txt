  "purpose": "A simple class to send messages to a Lark (Feishu) webhook URL.",
  "sources": "The webhook URL provided during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "The POST request to the constructed URL with message content.",
  "flows": "Input webhook URL -> stored as instance attribute -> used in send_message method -> POST request to URL with message payload.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. No malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for sending messages via a webhook. It accepts an external webhook URL, constructs a JSON payload, and posts it to the URL. No input validation or sanitization is performed, but this is typical for such utility code. The code uses the requests library correctly. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The main security concern is the external handling of the webhook URL, which could be exploited if the URL is malicious or compromised. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, reflecting low inherent risk but potential misuse if the webhook URL is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal implementation for sending messages via a webhook. It contains no malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the handling of the webhook URL, which is outside the code's scope. The scores are appropriate given the analysis.",
