  "purpose": "A class to send messages via a Lark bot webhook.",
  "sources": "The webhook URL provided during class instantiation; message parameter in send_message method.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post call that sends data to the constructed webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Input webhook URL and message flow into the send_message method, which constructs a URL and posts data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; the code dynamically uses the provided webhook URL. No obfuscation or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for sending messages to a Lark chat via a webhook URL. It accepts a webhook token during initialization, which is used to form the full request URL. The send_message method constructs a JSON payload and makes an HTTP POST request. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network behavior. It relies on user-provided webhook URL, and no data leakage or suspicious activity is evident. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for a chat notification bot, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
