{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for sending messages via a Lark chatbot webhook.",
  "sources": "The 'webhook' parameter supplied during class initialization, used in constructing the POST request URL.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post function that sends data to the constructed URL, potentially exposing the webhook URL if misused.",
  "flows": "Webhook parameter -> URL construction -> requests.post to the URL with message data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual or malicious behavior detected. The use of user input is limited to message content and webhook URL, which are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a class with a webhook URL, constructs a JSON payload, and sends it via HTTP POST to the specified Lark API endpoint. No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution are present. The only input that could be sensitive is the webhook URL, which should be kept confidential. The 'send_message' method properly uses parameterized data without unsafe eval or dynamic code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a Lark bot message sender without malicious intent. No malware or malicious behavior is detected. The primary security concern is safeguarding the webhook URL to prevent unauthorized message sending.",
