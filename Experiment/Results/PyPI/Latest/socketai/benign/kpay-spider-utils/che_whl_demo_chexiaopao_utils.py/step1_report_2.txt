  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function to print a string with a prefix.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'text' in the function pppprint.",
  "sinks": "The print statement that outputs combined string to standard output.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows from the function parameter to the print statement, resulting in output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors; no suspicious or unusual code features.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining a function that concatenates a fixed string 'che' with the input parameter and prints it. There are no external data reads, no network activity, no code injection, and no security-sensitive operations. The code does not perform any malicious actions, contain obfuscated logic, or include any suspicious behaviors. It appears to be a simple utility function with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing a basic print operation with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
