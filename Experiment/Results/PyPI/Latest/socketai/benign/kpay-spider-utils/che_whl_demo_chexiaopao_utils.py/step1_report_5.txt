  "purpose": "The function pppprint appears to be a simple wrapper around the print statement, concatenating a static string 'che' with the provided text.",
  "sources": "The code reads input via the parameter 'text' passed to pppprint.",
  "sinks": "The sink is the print function which outputs to the console.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'text' parameter to the print statement via string concatenation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and simple.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that prepends 'che' to any input text and prints it. There are no external data sources, network interactions, or suspicious code constructs. It does not perform any malicious actions or contain backdoors. The code's structure is minimal, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, simple, and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to serve a basic purpose of printing text with a fixed prefix.",
