{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function to print a string with a specific prefix.",
  "sources": "Input data is the parameter 'text' passed to the function 'pppprint'.",
  "sinks": "The print function outputs data to the console; no external or untrusted data sink is involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows from function parameter to the print statement after concatenation with 'che'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single function that prepends 'che' to the input string and prints it. There are no hardcoded credentials, no external network calls, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. The purpose appears to be simple string output. The author information and timestamp do not influence behavior but are standard comments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply outputs a modified string to the console.",
