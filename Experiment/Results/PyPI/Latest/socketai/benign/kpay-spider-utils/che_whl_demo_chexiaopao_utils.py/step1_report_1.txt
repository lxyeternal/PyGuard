{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function to print a string with a prefix.",
  "sources": "The function pppprint receives input 'text' and potentially from external callers.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs data to the console, which is generally harmless.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows directly into the print function after concatenation.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code is very minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that concatenates a static string 'che' with an input parameter and prints the result. No external data is fetched, no network communication occurs. The function could be used maliciously if called with malicious input, but the code itself does not contain malicious logic or behavior. It is a simple utility function with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a straightforward print utility.",
