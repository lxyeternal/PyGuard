  "purpose": "The function appears to be a simple print wrapper that prepends 'che' to the input text for display purposes.",
  "sources": "The function reads input from the 'text' parameter passed to 'pppprint'.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' statement outputs data to the console; no external data sink or network transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'text' parameter through the string concatenation ('che' + text) into the 'print' function, which outputs to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that prepends a fixed string to input and prints it. There are no external data sources, no network operations, no obfuscation, and no suspicious logic. The code is minimal and appears harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious behavior. It functions as a simple print wrapper with no security concerns.",
