  "purpose": "A simple Python function that concatenates 'che' with input text and prints it.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to standard output; no untrusted data flow beyond this.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows directly into the print statement without transformation or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and lacks obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimal function that prints a concatenated string. It does not perform network communication, handle credentials, or contain obfuscation. The behavior is benign, and no malicious or security-compromising actions are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external dependencies or suspicious logic support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
