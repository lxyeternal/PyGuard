  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as a metadata header, providing encoding, timestamp, and author information for a Python file.",
  "sources": "The comments themselves are static data; no input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs are involved; the code contains only comments.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, as the code is purely comments with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or unusual code structures are present; the snippet is straightforward metadata comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments indicating encoding, timestamp, and author, with no functions, variables, or executable code. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this snippet, noting the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the content. No source-to-sink data flows or anomalies are detected. The code is non-executable metadata, posing no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely metadata comments with no executable or malicious content. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No security concerns or malicious intent are present.",
