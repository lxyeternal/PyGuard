  "purpose": "This code defines a class for sending messages to a Lark bot via a webhook URL.",
  "sources": "The webhook URL provided during class instantiation; the message and user parameters in send_message method.",
  "sinks": "The HTTP POST request to the Lark API endpoint with the webhook URL, sending data via requests.post.",
  "flows": "Webhook URL (source) -> send_message method -> POST request to Lark API endpoint -> response JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated or suspicious code; standard use of requests library.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a class with a webhook URL, constructs a JSON payload, and sends it via HTTP POST to a fixed URL. No input validation or sanitization issues are evident; the webhook URL is provided externally, and no untrusted data manipulation is present. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or unusual activity. The URL construction is predictable and not obfuscated. The parameters are used as intended for a webhook communication, with no suspicious data flows or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for sending messages via a Lark bot webhook. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected; it is a typical utility class. Overall security risk is low.",
