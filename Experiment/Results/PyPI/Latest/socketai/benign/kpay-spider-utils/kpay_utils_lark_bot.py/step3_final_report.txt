  "purpose": "A simple Python class to send messages to a Lark (Feishu) bot via a webhook URL.",
  "sources": "The webhook URL provided during class instantiation; the message parameter in send_message method.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post call that transmits JSON payload to the constructed URL.",
  "flows": "Input webhook URL -> URL construction in send_message -> POST request with message payload.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious URL patterns. External input for webhook URL is standard but could be misused if malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and performs a benign task of sending a message via webhook. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration observed. The only potential concern is misuse if the webhook URL is malicious, but this is typical for webhook integrations. Scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: ~0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a webhook message sender. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The low security risk score appropriately reflects the external input handling, which is common in such integrations.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
