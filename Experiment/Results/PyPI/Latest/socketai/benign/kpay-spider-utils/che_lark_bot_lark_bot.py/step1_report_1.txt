  "purpose": "A simple Python class for sending messages via a Lark (WxBot) webhook",
  "sources": "The 'webhook' parameter in __init__, user input in send_message, message content",
  "sinks": "requests.post call with constructed URL and JSON payload",
  "flows": "Input 'webhook' -> stored in self.webhook -> used in URL in send_message -> requests.post sends data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious URL patterns, no unusual code structures, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward class for sending messages to a Lark chatbot via webhook. The webhook URL is passed during instantiation, which is then used to send POST requests containing message data. The URL construction appears standard, and no untrusted input is directly used in URL construction apart from the webhook parameter. The data payload is simple and does not contain sensitive information by default. The code uses requests.post with a timeout and returns the JSON response. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. All data handling seems benign and typical for webhook messaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a Lark webhook message sender. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
