  "purpose": "Send a text message to a specified webhook URL for Lark/Feishu platform notifications.",
  "sources": "User-provided webhook URL during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "The webhook URL used in the POST request; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input message and webhook URL (source) → constructed URL and JSON payload → POST request to the webhook endpoint (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious URL patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that constructs a POST request to a webhook URL with user-supplied message content. It uses standard libraries and HTTPS for communication. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The webhook URL is supplied externally, which is typical for such integrations. The code is clear, simple, and functionally correct. The only external concern is the trustworthiness of the webhook URL, but this is outside the code's scope. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality. No modifications are necessary.",
