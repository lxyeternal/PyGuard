  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module 'pymetkit'.",
  "sources": "The code imports everything (*) from the local module 'pymetkit'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output points are explicitly visible in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident from this code snippet alone.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a relative import with '*', which can obscure imported content and potentially hide malicious code, but alone this is not conclusive.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement that pulls all symbols from a local module. This pattern can be used to hide malicious imports if the module itself contains malicious code. Without inspecting the contents of 'pymetkit', no definitive malicious activity can be identified. The use of 'from .pymetkit import *' is generally discouraged for clarity and security reasons, but it is not inherently malicious. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code is evident from this line alone.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet by itself does not demonstrate malicious intent, but the reliance on a local module with a wildcard import warrants further review of the 'pymetkit' module's contents for security concerns.",
