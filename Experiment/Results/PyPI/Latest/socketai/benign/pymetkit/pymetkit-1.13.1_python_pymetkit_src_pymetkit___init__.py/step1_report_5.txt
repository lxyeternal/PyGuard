  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module 'pymetkit'.",
  "sources": "The source is the local import statement 'from .pymetkit import *'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potential security effects are evident in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis can be performed from a single import statement without additional code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure what is imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code, but this alone is not malicious. No other anomalies are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import of all contents from a local module named 'pymetkit'. This is a standard Python practice to include local module functions or classes. The use of 'import *' can make code less explicit and harder to analyze, but it is not inherently malicious. No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are apparent from this single line. No external data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no visible malicious intent or security risks. The use of 'import *' is a potential concern for code clarity but not for security. Overall, the snippet alone does not suggest malicious activity.",
