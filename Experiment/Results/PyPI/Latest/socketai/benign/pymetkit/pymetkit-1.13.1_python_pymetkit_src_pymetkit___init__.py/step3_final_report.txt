  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local module 'pymetkit'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the provided code snippet; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable from the import statement alone.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' and relative import syntax, which can obscure imported symbols but are not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a wildcard import from a local module, which by itself does not demonstrate malicious behavior. The security implications depend entirely on the contents of 'pymetkit', which are not provided. The use of 'import *' can hinder code clarity and maintainability but is not an indicator of malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the minimal evidence, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and low risk scores reflecting the potential for hidden issues within the module. Confidence levels are appropriately set based on the limited context. Overall, the import statement is benign, but further inspection of 'pymetkit' is necessary for a comprehensive security assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement alone does not indicate malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security concern is the content of 'pymetkit', which cannot be evaluated here. The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate given the limited code snippet. No immediate security risks are evident from this import statement.",
