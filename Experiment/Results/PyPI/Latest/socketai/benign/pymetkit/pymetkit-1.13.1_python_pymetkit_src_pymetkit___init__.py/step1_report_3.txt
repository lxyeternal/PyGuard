  "purpose": "Import all components from the local module 'pymetkit'.",
  "sources": "The import statement indicates reading the module's code and any associated resources.",
  "sinks": "The import itself is a sink if the module contains malicious code or hidden backdoors, but the statement alone does not show untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink flow in this line; it only performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a relative import syntax which is typical in package development, but no suspicious or unusual code features are evident from this single line. Cannot determine if the imported module is malicious without inspecting its content.",
  "analysis": "This snippet is a simple import statement that brings in all components from a local module named 'pymetkit'. There is no embedded malicious code, obfuscated behavior, or suspicious patterns within this line. However, the security implications depend entirely on the contents of 'pymetkit', which are not provided. The code itself is straightforward and standard for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The security assessment of the package depends on the contents of 'pymetkit'.",
