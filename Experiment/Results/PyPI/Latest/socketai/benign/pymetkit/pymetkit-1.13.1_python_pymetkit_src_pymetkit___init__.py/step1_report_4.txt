  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module 'pymetkit'.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement itself, which loads a module or package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data handling shown in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible; the code only performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import could be suspicious if misused, but not inherently malicious. The import is a simple import statement with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement. It imports all contents from the module 'pymetkit' located in the same package. No further code is provided, so no analysis of the module's contents is possible. The import statement by itself is not malicious, but it depends on the contents of 'pymetkit'. Without inspecting 'pymetkit', we cannot determine if it contains malicious code. The import syntax itself is straightforward and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this single import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a simple import of a local module, with no evidence of malware or security issues in this snippet.",
