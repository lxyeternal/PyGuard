{
  "purpose": "Python wrapper for the MetKit C API to create, parse, and manage Mars requests with error handling and dynamic library loading.",
  "sources": "Input parameters, file or string data, internal C API functions, environment variables during library load.",
  "sinks": "C API functions, data encoding/decoding, error messages, library functions, no external network or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input (strings/files) through encoding functions into C API calls, with error handling and version checks, returning data or raising exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Standard library loading and version check warnings are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python binding to a C API, performing data encoding/decoding, request management, and error handling. It loads shared libraries dynamically, verifies version consistency, and wraps C functions with error checks. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. The security posture is typical for such bindings, with low risk and no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Python wrapper for the MetKit C API, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and risk score (~0.2) are appropriate and justified.",
