  "purpose": "Importing modules and retrieving package version information.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version(\"pymetkit\") retrieves version info from installed package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; version info retrieval is generally safe.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a local module, then retrieves package version info. No input handling, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns are present. The code appears straightforward and aligns with typical package setup or initialization code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard imports and version retrieval without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
