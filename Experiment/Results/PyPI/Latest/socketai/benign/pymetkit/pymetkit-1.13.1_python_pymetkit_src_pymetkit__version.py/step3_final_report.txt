{
  "purpose": "The code imports standard libraries and a local module, then retrieves and assigns the version of the 'pymetkit' package.",
  "sources": "Import statements and the importlib.metadata.version call retrieving 'pymetkit' version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static import and version retrieval only.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .pymetkit import *' is discouraged but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports and version retrieval with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of 'import *' is a style concern but not a security issue. No data flows or external communications are present. All indicators point to benign, standard package initialization code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard operations, and poses no security threat. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are appropriate and should remain at 0.",
