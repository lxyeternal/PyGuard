  "purpose": "Load the version information of the 'pymetkit' package",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version('pymetkit')",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks identified",
  "flows": "The version string is obtained from the package metadata and stored in __version__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Path class from pathlib and a module from the local package. It then retrieves the version of the 'pymetkit' package using importlib.metadata.version and assigns it to __version__. There are no indications of data leaks, malicious activity, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a straightforward setup or version check snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple version retrieval for a package and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is typical in package initialization files.",
