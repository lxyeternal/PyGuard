  "purpose": "Initialize the module and retrieve the version of the 'pymetkit' package.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version('pymetkit') retrieves the installed package version; 'from pathlib import Path' may be used for filesystem operations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leaks or malicious data handling detected.",
  "flows": "Retrieving version info is straightforward and does not involve untrusted data flows; no source-to-sink flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'importlib.metadata.version' is standard; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Path' for filesystem operations, imports everything from a local module '.pymetkit', and retrieves the package version via 'importlib.metadata'. All usage appears standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code is minimal and follows typical patterns for module initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily performing setup tasks without any malicious intent or security concerns. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
