  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is straightforward, involving standard imports and version retrieval.\n   - No suspicious or malicious code, data leaks, or network activity are identified.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be considered malicious, such as data exfiltration, code execution, or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the use of `import *` is discouraged but not malicious.\n   - No logical flaws or errors are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree on the benign nature, and the code performs only standard import and version retrieval, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The code does not introduce any security risks or malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - No malicious activity is present, so this score is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not rely on assumptions; they base their conclusions on observable code behavior.\n   - The code is minimal and standard, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - They accurately reflect the benign analysis.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is a simple module setup that imports standard libraries, a local module, and retrieves the package version.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk behaviors are present.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**My Own Estimation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code analysis.\n\n**Final note:** No further action is necessary. The code is safe and does not pose any security threat.",
