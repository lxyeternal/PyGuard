{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules and retrieves the version information of the 'pymetkit' package.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version('pymetkit') retrieves package version; 'from pathlib import Path' and 'from .pymetkit import *' import modules and all symbols from a local package.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or output is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only performs imports and version retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure imported symbols, which might lead to unpredictable behavior but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and local modules, then retrieves the version of the 'pymetkit' package using importlib.metadata. There are no user inputs, network communications, or data leaks. The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged but is not malicious. The code appears to be a standard module setup without any suspicious or malicious components.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing standard import and version retrieval operations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
