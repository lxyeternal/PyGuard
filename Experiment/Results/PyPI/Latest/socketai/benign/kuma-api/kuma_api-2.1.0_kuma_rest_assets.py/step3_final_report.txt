  "purpose": "API wrapper class for managing assets via HTTP requests",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters in methods (kwargs, asset lists, tenant_id)",
  "sinks": "Request payloads sent via _make_request to external API endpoints",
  "flows": "Input parameters → JSON payloads → _make_request call",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution; direct inclusion of user input in request payloads",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client that constructs JSON payloads from user inputs and calls an external request method. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The main concern is lack of input validation, which could lead to injection if inputs are malicious, but this is a common pattern in API wrappers and not inherently malicious. The external _make_request function's security depends on its implementation, which is outside this snippet. The reports correctly assign malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low security risk (~0.2), which is justified given the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign API wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score is appropriate, primarily due to unvalidated inputs, but no malicious activity is evident. The scores and assessments are consistent and justified.",
