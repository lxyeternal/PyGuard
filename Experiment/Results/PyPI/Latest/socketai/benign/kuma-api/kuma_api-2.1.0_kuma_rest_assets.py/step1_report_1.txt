  "purpose": "Provides methods for managing assets through API requests, including search, delete, and create operations.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters such as kwargs in search, and function arguments assets_fqdns, assets_ids, assets_ips, tenant_id in delete and create methods.",
  "sinks": "The _make_request function calls with method, endpoint, and data, which could potentially handle untrusted data if not properly validated.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (kwargs, assets lists, tenant_id) flow into JSON payloads, which are sent via _make_request. No evident unsafe handling or direct execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of standard API request patterns with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs JSON payloads from input parameters and calls an API request method. No direct use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious data handling or malicious logic observed. The absence of validation checks or sanitization is a potential concern, but not malicious by itself. Overall, this appears to be straightforward API interaction code with standard structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs asset management API requests with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears to be a typical API wrapper implementation. No malware or security risks are evident in this code snippet.",
