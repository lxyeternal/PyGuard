  "purpose": "Provides methods for managing assets via API requests, including searching, deleting, and creating assets.",
  "sources": "User-provided method arguments such as kwargs, assets lists, tenant_id, assets_fqdns, assets_ids, assets_ips",
  "sinks": "API request methods (_make_request) with parameters constructed from user inputs",
  "flows": "User input data flows into JSON payloads and query parameters sent to _make_request calls",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic code execution, no suspicious variables or functions",
  "analysis": "The class methods construct JSON payloads from user inputs and pass them to an API request function. The inputs are directly included in the request data, but there are no signs of malicious manipulation or malicious code injection within this code fragment. The code relies on an external '_make_request' method whose implementation is unknown, but assuming standard request behavior, this code appears to perform legitimate API interactions for asset management. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads, is evident in this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward API client wrapper for asset management. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment. It relies on external functions, but there are no signs of supply chain attacks or sabotage.",
