  "purpose": "The code provides methods for managing assets in a system, including searching, deleting, and creating assets via API requests.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters such as 'kwargs' for search filters, lists of asset identifiers (FQDNs, IDs, IPs), and 'tenant_id' for delete and create operations.",
  "sinks": "The '_make_request' method calls, which send HTTP requests with JSON payloads or query parameters to external endpoints.",
  "flows": "Input data from user parameters flows into JSON payloads or URL parameters, which are then sent via HTTP requests to external APIs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs standard API request operations with parameter passing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods for asset management through API requests, with parameters controlled externally. There are no indications of malicious code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors. The data passed into requests appears to be user-controlled but used in typical API request contexts. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious network activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard application code for managing assets via API calls, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on the '_make_request' method, whose implementation is unknown, but the usage here does not suggest malicious behavior.",
