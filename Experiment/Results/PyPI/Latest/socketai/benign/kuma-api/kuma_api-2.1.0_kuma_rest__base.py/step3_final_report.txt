  "purpose": "A Python class implementing a REST API client for Kaspersky's KUMA platform, managing sessions, SSL verification, request handling, and error processing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as URL, token, verify flag, and optional logger; internal session request calls.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to the API endpoint, response parsing, and potential data handling in responses.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into session configuration; requests are made via _make_request; responses are processed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "Default SSL verification is disabled (verify=False), which is insecure but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured API client with proper error handling, logging, and session management. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The main security concern is the default SSL verification disabled, which could expose to man-in-the-middle attacks if not explicitly configured. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. The request and response handling are standard, with appropriate error and content-type processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API client with a minor security configuration issue regarding SSL verification defaults. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected. The security risk score of 0.2 is justified due to the default 'verify=False' setting, which should be explicitly set by users in production environments.",
