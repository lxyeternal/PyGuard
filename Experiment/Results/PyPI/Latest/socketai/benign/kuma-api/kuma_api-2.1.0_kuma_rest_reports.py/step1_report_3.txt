  "purpose": "Defines a class for interacting with an API to retrieve report data, with a method for searching reports based on various filters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'tenants_ids' and '**kwargs' in the 'search' method.",
  "sinks": "The '_make_request' method of the '_base' object, which sends an HTTP request.",
  "flows": "Input data ('tenants_ids' and 'kwargs') flow into the 'params' dictionary, which is then used in '_make_request' to perform an HTTP GET request.",
  "anomalies": "The line 'params = { \"tenantIDs\": tenants_ids**kwargs, }' contains a syntax error: the use of '**' is invalid in this context. It appears to be a mistake or typo; normally, '**' is used for unpacking dictionaries in function calls, not within a dictionary definition.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to create request parameters for an API call, but contains a critical syntax error in constructing the 'params' dictionary. The incorrect use of '**' within the dictionary likely prevents the code from executing properly. Aside from this syntax issue, the code does not perform any suspicious actions, nor does it handle data in a malicious manner. The class appears to be a straightforward API client wrapper with no obfuscated code or malicious intent. The potential vulnerability or malicious behavior is the syntax error, which would cause runtime failure rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a syntax error that would prevent execution, but no malicious behavior or security issues are evident. It appears to be a simple API wrapper class with a bug rather than malicious or maliciously intended code.",
