{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for interacting with a REST API to retrieve report data, including a search method with filtering options.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'tenants_ids' and '**kwargs' used in the 'search' method; the '_base' object used to make HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "The '_make_request' method call on the '_base' object, which may send data over the network; potentially untrusted input passed into 'params'.",
  "flows": "Input 'tenants_ids' and '**kwargs' flow into 'params', which are then used in '_make_request' to perform a GET request.",
  "anomalies": "The 'params' dictionary is constructed with 'tenantIDs' key, but the value assigned is 'tenants_ids**kwargs', which is syntactically incorrect and likely a typo or mistake. No actual malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition with a method for making an API request. The 'search' method attempts to build request parameters but contains a syntax error in constructing the 'params' dictionary: 'tenants_ids**kwargs' is invalid syntax. This indicates a bug rather than malicious intent. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network behavior. The method relies on the '_base' object for making HTTP requests, which is standard. Overall, the code appears to be standard API wrapper code with a coding mistake, not malicious or maliciously intended.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a syntax error in constructing request parameters, likely a typo. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The primary concern is a bug that prevents proper execution. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.",
