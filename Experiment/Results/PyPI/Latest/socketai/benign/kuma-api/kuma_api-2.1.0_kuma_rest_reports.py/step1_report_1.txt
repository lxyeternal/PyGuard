{
  "purpose": "This code provides methods to interact with a REST API for managing reports, specifically searching for reports based on various filters.",
  "sources": "The 'search' method reads input parameters such as 'tenants_ids' and '**kwargs' which include filter options like 'id', 'name', 'limit', etc.",
  "sinks": "The '_make_request' method is called with 'GET' and the constructed 'params', which could potentially send untrusted data over the network. However, since '_make_request' is not defined here, the actual sink is within that method.",
  "flows": "Input parameters from the 'search' method flow into the 'params' dictionary, which is then used in '_make_request' to perform an HTTP request.",
  "anomalies": "The 'params' dictionary construction appears to have a typo: 'tenantIDs': tenants_ids**kwargs, which likely intended to unpack 'kwargs' but is syntactically incorrect. The double asterisks '**' are misplaced here, causing a syntax error. This suggests the code may not execute properly or could be intentionally obfuscated or incomplete.",
  "analysis": "The code is intended to construct request parameters from method inputs and send an API request. However, there is a critical syntax error in the line '\"tenantIDs\": tenants_ids**kwargs', which would prevent execution. This could be a typo or an attempt to obscure intent. The method uses 'kwargs' for flexible filtering, which is typical for API query methods. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic in this fragment. The '_make_request' method's implementation is not shown; thus, the actual data flow and potential security risks depend on its implementation. The code structure itself does not indicate malicious behavior or obfuscation, just a possible syntax mistake or incomplete code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard API interaction method with a syntax error in parameter construction. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The main concern is the syntax mistake which may be accidental or an indicator of incomplete/obfuscated code. Overall, no malicious intent is evident, but the code as provided would not run correctly without fixing the syntax.",
