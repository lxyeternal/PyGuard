{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for interacting with a REST API to retrieve reports, specifically providing a search method that constructs request parameters.",
  "sources": "The method reads input data from the 'tenants_ids' parameter and additional filters via '**kwargs'.",
  "sinks": "The untrusted data could potentially flow into the '_make_request' method, which handles network requests; however, the implementation is not provided, so actual data handling cannot be assessed.",
  "flows": "Input 'tenants_ids' and '**kwargs' are intended to be merged into the 'params' dictionary, which is then passed to '_make_request'. The current code attempts to assign 'params' as {'tenantIDs': tenants_ids**kwargs}, which is invalid syntax and prevents execution.",
  "anomalies": "The use of '**' within a dictionary value ('tenants_ids**kwargs') is a syntax error; this appears to be a typo or incomplete code. No other anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to create request parameters for an API call, but contains a syntax error in constructing 'params'. The use of '**' within a dictionary literal is invalid; likely the intended code was to merge 'kwargs' into 'params' with proper syntax, such as 'params = {\"tenantIDs\": tenants_ids, **kwargs}'. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The main issue is a bug that would prevent execution, but it does not indicate malicious intent or supply chain attack. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting that the primary concern is a syntax error, not security.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a syntax mistake that prevents it from running but shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores should reflect a low security risk and no malware, with the main fix being correcting the syntax to properly merge 'kwargs' into 'params'.",
