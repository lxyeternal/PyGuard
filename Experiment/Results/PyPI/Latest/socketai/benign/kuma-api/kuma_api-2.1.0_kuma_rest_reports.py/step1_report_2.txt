{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for interacting with a REST API to fetch reports related to tenants.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'kwargs' argument passed to the 'search' method, particularly 'tenants_ids' and other potential filters.",
  "sinks": "The 'params' dictionary is used in the '_make_request' method, which likely sends an HTTP request to an external server.",
  "flows": "Data from 'kwargs' flows into the 'params' dictionary, which is then used as part of the request parameters in '_make_request'.",
  "anomalies": "There is a suspicious use of 'tenants_ids**kwargs' which appears to be a syntax error or a typo; it does not align with valid Python syntax. No other anomalies are evident.",
  "analysis": "The class appears to be a straightforward API client wrapper. The 'search' method constructs request parameters based on input arguments. The line 'params = {\"tenantIDs\": tenants_ids**kwargs,}' is likely incorrect syntax, possibly intended to merge 'tenants_ids' with other filter parameters, but as written, it will cause a syntax error, preventing execution. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or malicious code is present. The code does not perform any malicious behavior or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended as a simple API wrapper with a probable syntax error. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The main concern is the syntax mistake, not malicious behavior.",
