  "purpose": "A comprehensive Python client for interacting with a REST API, handling resource management, file uploads/downloads, alert and event processing, and data manipulation.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, environment variables, file reads, request payloads, response headers",
  "sinks": "API request endpoints, response parsing, file content handling",
  "flows": "Input data and parameters flow into API requests; responses are processed and returned",
  "anomalies": "Accepts raw CSV data or file paths without validation; default SSL verification disabled (`verify=False`), which is insecure",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured API client library with clear functions for resource management, data transfer, and event handling. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The primary security concern is the default `verify=False` in requests, which disables SSL certificate verification, exposing to man-in-the-middle attacks. The CSV data input in `update_dictionary_from_csv()` could be exploited if malicious data is supplied, but this is a typical pattern and not malicious per se. No signs of malware, code injection, or sabotage are evident. Response parsing is straightforward, with no suspicious data flows or exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The main security issue is the default SSL verification being disabled, which should be explicitly enabled (`verify=True`) in production environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.3 due to the insecure default SSL setting. These concerns are configuration issues rather than malicious intent.",
