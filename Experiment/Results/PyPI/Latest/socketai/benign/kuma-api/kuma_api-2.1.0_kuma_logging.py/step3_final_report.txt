  "purpose": "Configure basic logging for the application, setting levels, format, and optional file output.",
  "sources": "Parameters: 'level', 'log_file', 'format'; logging handlers created within the function.",
  "sinks": "logging configuration functions; setting log levels for third-party modules.",
  "flows": "Parameters influence handlers and logger setup; handlers output logs to stream and optionally to file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard logging setup with no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward logging configuration function that creates handlers based on parameters, sets log levels, and adjusts third-party module log levels. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The code uses standard library functions securely, and the parameters are typical for logging setup. No external inputs are handled insecurely, and the code does not perform any malicious actions or data exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or very close to zero) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe logging configuration function with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified. No further action is necessary.",
