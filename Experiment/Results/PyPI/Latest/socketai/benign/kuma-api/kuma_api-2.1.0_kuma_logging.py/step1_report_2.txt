  "purpose": "Configure basic logging settings for an application, allowing optional log file output.",
  "sources": "Function arguments: level, log_file, format",
  "sinks": "Logging handlers (StreamHandler and optionally FileHandler) that write logs to stdout or a file",
  "flows": "Arguments → handlers list → logging.basicConfig → handlers used for logging outputs",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious dynamic behaviors observed. No use of environment variables for secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a logging configuration with customizable level, format, and optional file output. It adds standard handlers and adjusts logging levels for specific third-party modules. No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code appears straightforward and adheres to typical logging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging configuration module with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply sets up logging handlers and levels without any suspicious behaviors.",
