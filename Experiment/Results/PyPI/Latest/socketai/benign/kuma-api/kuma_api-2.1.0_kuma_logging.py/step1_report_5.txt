  "purpose": "Configure basic logging for a Python application with optional file logging.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'log_file' (if provided), default logging level, and format string.",
  "sinks": "Logging handlers (StreamHandler and FileHandler), which output log messages to console or file.",
  "flows": "Function parameters -> handlers list -> logging.basicConfig -> log message output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Use of standard logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to set up logging with configurable level, format, and optional file output. It appends stream and optionally file handlers to the logger. It sets warning levels for 'urllib3' and 'requests' loggers. The implementation is standard and does not contain obfuscation, malicious instructions, or anomalies. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, secure logging configuration function with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
