  "flows": "The function flows from parameter inputs to configuration of logging handlers, then to returning a logger object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and typical for logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to set up logging with configurable level, format, and optional file output. It appends handlers accordingly and sets logging levels for specific modules. No user input or external data sources are involved. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard logging configuration without any malicious intent or security issues. It is safe and typical for application setup.",
