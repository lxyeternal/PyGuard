  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the potential security implications, correctness, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward API wrapper for resource management.\n- The main security concern is the use of hardcoded default passwords ('Kuma_secret_p@$$w0rd') in multiple methods.\n- The 'upload' method attempts to open files with an incorrect parameter 'uncode' instead of 'encoding', which is a bug, not malicious.\n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.\n- No obfuscated or intentionally malicious code detected.\n- The '_make_request' method is external and not shown; security depends on its implementation.\n\n---\n\n### **Specific analysis per report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confidence: 0.7\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.4\n- Notes: No malicious behavior; concerns are mainly about insecure default passwords and a typo in file reading.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The score of malware=0 aligns with the analysis. The security risk score (0.4) is reasonable given the insecure default passwords.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Confidence: 0.8\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.3\n- Notes: Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the insecure default password and the typo in 'upload'.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate. The security risk score (0.3) is slightly lower, reflecting perhaps a marginally lesser concern, which seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Confidence: 0.8\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.4\n- Notes: Same core issues—hardcoded passwords and a typo.\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the reasoning. The malware score remains 0, consistent with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Confidence: 0.8\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.4\n- Notes: Same issues; emphasizes the bug in file reading and insecure passwords.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the malware score remains appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Confidence: 0.8\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.3\n- Notes: Similar to others, with emphasis on the static password and the file reading bug.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent reasoning; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** They vary between 0.3 and 0.4, reflecting security concerns mainly about hardcoded passwords and a bug, but no active malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My expert estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0.4 — the main concern is insecure default passwords and the file reading bug, which could be exploited or cause runtime errors but do not constitute malware or sabotage.\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n\n- The scores given in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- The security concerns are valid but do not indicate malicious intent.\n- The critical issues are insecure default passwords and a bug in file handling, which should be addressed but do not elevate the risk to malware level.\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.4\n\nThese reflect the current assessment: security issues exist but no malicious activity.",
