  "purpose": "Define a class for interacting with Kuma REST API folders endpoint, including a search method.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in the search method (kwargs), class constructor storing 'base' object.",
  "sinks": "Calling '_make_request' method on the 'base' object, which presumably performs an HTTP request.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (kwargs) passed to '_make_request' method via 'params' dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The class provides an interface for API interaction, specifically for folder-related data. The 'search' method accepts various filters and options, then constructs a 'params' dictionary to pass to '_make_request'. There is no evidence of dynamic code execution, data leakage, or malicious network behavior. The code relies on the 'base' object to handle the request, and there are no signs of misuse or malicious intent. The code appears to be straightforward API wrapper code without obfuscation or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client wrapper with no malicious behavior detected. It correctly encapsulates API calls for folder searches with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
