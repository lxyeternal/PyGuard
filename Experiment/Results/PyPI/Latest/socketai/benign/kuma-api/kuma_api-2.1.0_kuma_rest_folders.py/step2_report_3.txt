  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward API client class that constructs request parameters from method arguments and delegates to an external `_make_request` method.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The code relies on the external `_make_request` method, which is not provided, so some assumptions are necessary about its behavior.\n- The input parameters are passed directly into request parameters without sanitization, but this is typical for API wrappers; unless the `_make_request` is malicious, this alone isn't a security concern.\n- No signs of code injection, data leakage, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly describes the class as an API wrapper with a search method.\n- **Analysis:** Finds no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and standard usage.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.2, Confidence 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.2) seems reasonable given the code's nature, but the confidence is slightly less than perfect due to the unknown implementation of `_make_request`.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, describes a class for API interaction.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, straightforward code.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.1, Confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The high confidence and low risk score are justified. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, straightforward API wrapper.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.1, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable scores; the slightly lower confidence (0.9) is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, describes the class as an API client.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, standard pattern.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.1, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same general description.\n- **Analysis:** Points out that unvalidated parameters are passed directly, which could be a concern if `_make_request` is malicious. But in typical API wrappers, this is normal.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.2, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) due to passing unvalidated data, but this is standard for such wrappers. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** Scores are low (0.1–0.2), which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### **Potential issues:**\n\n- The only concern could be if `_make_request` is malicious, but since it's external and not shown, we can't assess it here.\n- Passing `kwargs` directly into request parameters is typical, but if `_make_request` mishandles or logs sensitive data, that could be a risk—though not evident here.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's simplicity and the lack of validation, a slightly higher risk score (around 0.1–0.2) is justified, which aligns with the reports.\n\n**Overall, the reports are consistent and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since the code is a typical API wrapper, and the main concern is unvalidated input passed to an external request method, which is standard practice but still warrants a minimal risk score).\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and cautious. No malicious activity is evident, and the scores reflect the code's straightforward nature. The primary concern would be the implementation of `_make_request`, but that is outside the scope of this code snippet.",
