  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward API client wrapper class, with a `search` method that constructs request parameters from input arguments and delegates to `_make_request`.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The `_make_request` method's implementation is not provided, but assuming standard HTTP request handling, there are no obvious security issues.\n- The `kwargs` are passed directly into request parameters without validation or sanitization, but this is typical for API wrappers. The risk depends on the server-side handling and the context, not necessarily on the client code.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or code injection.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** API wrapper for folder management.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8\n- **Assessment:** The report reasonably states that the code is standard and safe. The security risk is low, and the confidence is high.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as a straightforward API wrapper with no malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Similar API class.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes the lack of malicious behavior. The low security risk is justified.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** API client for alert folders.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's simplicity and safety.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** API wrapper for folder search.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** While the report notes that unvalidated `kwargs` could be a concern, in the context of an API client, this is typical. The potential risk is minimal unless the server-side mishandles parameters.\n- **Justification for securityRisk=0.2:** Slightly higher than others due to passing unvalidated data, but not inherently malicious.\n- **Verdict:** The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, as the code is clear.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations, but all are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting the minimal inherent risk in such API wrapper code.\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (standard API wrapper with minimal risk; passing unvalidated parameters is typical but could be slightly risky if server-side validation is poor)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The scores assigned are reasonable, and no modifications are necessary. The code is safe, with no signs of malware or obfuscation, and the slight security risk is justified by the lack of input validation but is typical for such code.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a standard, safe API client wrapper with minimal inherent security concerns.",
