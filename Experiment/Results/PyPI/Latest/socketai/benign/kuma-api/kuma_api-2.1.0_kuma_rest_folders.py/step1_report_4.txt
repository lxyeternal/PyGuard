  "purpose": "Provides methods for working with alert folders in a Kuma REST API client",
  "sources": "Input parameters in the search method, specifically 'tenants_ids' and '**kwargs'",
  "sinks": "The '_make_request' method call, which likely performs an HTTP request with provided parameters",
  "flows": "Input data (tenants_ids, kwargs) flows into 'params', which is then used in '_make_request' call",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; use of **kwargs for flexible request parameters is typical",
  "analysis": "The class initializes with a base object and defines a method 'search' that constructs request parameters from input arguments. It delegates the request to '_make_request', which is presumed to handle HTTP requests. No evidence of data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscated code is present. The code appears to be a straightforward API client implementation. No suspicious behaviors, malicious payloads, or malicious control flows are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client class method for querying folders, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears safe and functional.",
