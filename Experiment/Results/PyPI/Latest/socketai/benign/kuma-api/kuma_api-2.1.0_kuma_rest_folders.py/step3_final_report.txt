  "purpose": "API wrapper class for managing folder resources via HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in 'search' method, including 'tenants_ids' and 'kwargs'.",
  "sinks": "The call to '_make_request' with constructed parameters; potential for injection if '_make_request' mishandles inputs.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> parameters dictionary -> '_make_request' call.",
  "anomalies": "Passing 'kwargs' directly into request parameters without validation; no input sanitization or validation shown.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client wrapper that constructs request parameters from method arguments and delegates request execution to an external method. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The main concern is the lack of input validation for 'kwargs', which could pose a risk if '_make_request' does not sanitize inputs properly. However, this pattern is common in API wrappers, and the security implications depend on the implementation of '_make_request'. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0.1-0.2, obfuscated=0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and the typical context of such wrappers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe API wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The slight security risk stems from unvalidated input parameters, but this is common in such patterns and depends on downstream validation. Overall, the code is low risk and free of malware.",
