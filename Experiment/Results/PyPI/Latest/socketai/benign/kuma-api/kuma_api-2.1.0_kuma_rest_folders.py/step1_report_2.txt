{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for interacting with Kuma REST API folders, providing a method to search for folders with various filtering options.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from method parameters (e.g., tenants_ids, kwargs) when the search method is called.",
  "sinks": "The only external data interaction occurs through the _make_request method, which sends an HTTP GET request with parameters.",
  "flows": "Input data from method arguments (kwargs) is included in the params dictionary and passed to _make_request for an API call.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of parameters is straightforward. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with an __init__ method storing a base object, and a search method that constructs a parameter dictionary from input arguments. The method then makes a request via _make_request. The logic is simple, with no signs of malicious behavior. There are no unusual code constructs, no obfuscated code, and no insecure operations observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard API wrapper method for retrieving folder information from Kuma. No malicious intent or security issues are detected based on the provided fragment.",
