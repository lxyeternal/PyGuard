{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes from local modules and defines public API exposure via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from relative modules (.private and .rest).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as no runtime data processing or external data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The __all__ list incorrectly references string 'rest' instead of 'public', which may cause unintended behavior. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports classes and defines the module's public interface. The __all__ list has a potential typo ('rest' instead of 'public'), but this is not malicious. No malicious code, external network activity, or data leaks are observed. The structure and content are straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module interface with a minor naming inconsistency in __all__. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
