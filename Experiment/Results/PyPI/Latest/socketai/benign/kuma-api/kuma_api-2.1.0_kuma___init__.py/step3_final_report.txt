{
  "purpose": "This code imports classes from sibling modules and defines the module's __all__ list for export.",
  "sources": "Imports from .private and .rest modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data flows",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; straightforward import and export",
  "anomalies": "The __all__ list contains 'rest' while the imported class is named 'public', indicating a typo",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple imports and defines __all__ with a mismatch between 'rest' and 'public'. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The mismatch is likely a typo that could cause runtime import errors but does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with a minor typo in __all__ that should be corrected for proper module behavior. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
