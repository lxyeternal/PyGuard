{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to import specific classes from local modules and define exported symbols for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported classes 'KUMAPrivateAPI' and 'KumaRestAPI' from local modules '.private' and '.rest'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and declares exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses relative imports and assigns string names in __all__, but there are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from sibling modules, assigns their names to local aliases, and specifies '__all__' with string names 'rest' and 'private'. There is no dynamic execution, no input handling, and no suspicious behavior. The use of relative imports suggests this is part of a larger package structure. No malicious patterns are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple module interface for a package, importing classes and defining exports. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks in this snippet.",
