{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to import specific classes from internal modules and define public API exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.private and .rest)",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external communication present",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; only class imports and __all__ assignment",
  "anomalies": "The __all__ list includes 'rest' and 'private', but does not match the imported names 'public' and 'private', indicating possible misconfiguration or typo. No other suspicious code or hardcoded secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes named KUMAPrivateAPI and KumaRestAPI from internal modules and assigns an __all__ list intended for module exports. However, the __all__ list includes 'rest', which does not correspond to the imported 'public', and 'private' matches. This mismatch could be a typographical error or an indication of intended different export names. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks are evident. The code appears to be standard module setup with a minor inconsistency in the __all__ list.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, performing typical imports and export definitions with a minor potential typo in the __all__ list. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
