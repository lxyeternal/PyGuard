{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules or classes from local packages and defines an export list for the module.",
  "sources": "Imports from .private and .rest modules, which could potentially load external or internal code.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as network calls, file operations, or untrusted data handling in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imported classes 'KUMAPrivateAPI' and 'KumaRestAPI' are assigned to local names 'private' and 'public', but there are no data flows or processing within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The __all__ list incorrectly includes 'rest', which is not defined or assigned; it likely intends to include 'public' instead. This suggests a possible typo or misconfiguration, but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple module imports and sets an export list. There are no visible data inputs, outputs, or data flow mechanisms that could lead to security issues. The incorrect __all__ list could cause runtime errors if the module is imported, but it does not indicate malicious behavior. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup with a minor mistake in the __all__ list. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on this snippet alone.",
