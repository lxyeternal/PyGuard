  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Code Recap:**\n\n```python\nfrom .private import KUMAPrivateAPI as private\nfrom .rest import KumaRestAPI as public\n\n__all__ = [\"rest\", \"private\"]\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as importing classes and defining exports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; straightforward module interface.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Anomalies:** Highlights that `__all__` lists `'rest'` instead of `'public'`.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; this is a typo, not malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0.1 (due to the typo, but not a security concern)\n\n**Note:** The typo in `__all__` could cause runtime issues but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same.\n- **Anomalies:** Also points out mismatch: `__all__` contains `'rest'` and `'private'`, while imported names are `'public'` and `'private'`.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; likely a typo.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Observation:** The mismatch is consistent with previous reports; no malicious implications.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes `'rest'` in `__all__` instead of `'public'`.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; minor typo.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0.1 (again, typo, not malicious)\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same.\n- **Anomalies:** Same mismatch in `__all__`.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; minor typo.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis**\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code is straightforward, importing classes and defining `__all__`.\n- **Anomalies:** All reports correctly identify that `__all__` references `'rest'` instead of `'public'`. This is a typo, not malicious.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Security Risks:** The only concern is the typo in `__all__`, which could cause import errors but does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Scores & Justification**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0. All reports agree on no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** Given the typo, the security risk is minimal—mainly potential runtime errors, not security vulnerabilities. A score of 0.1 is reasonable, reflecting a minor issue, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate**\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Risk Score:** **0.1** (due to the typo in `__all__`, which could affect module behavior but not security)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, with a minor typo in the `__all__` list that should be corrected for proper module behavior. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
