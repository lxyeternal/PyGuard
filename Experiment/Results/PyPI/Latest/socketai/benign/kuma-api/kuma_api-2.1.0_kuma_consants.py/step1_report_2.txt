{
  "purpose": "Definition of a shared tenant configuration object, likely for use in a larger multi-tenant system.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static dictionary to SHARED_TENANT, no input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no data leaks or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static data assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Use of zero-like numerical values for createdAt and updatedAt may suggest placeholders or improper initialization; no other suspicious behavior or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static dictionary representing a tenant object with fixed attributes. There are no dynamic inputs, no external data fetches, and no code execution or network interactions. The timestamp fields are assigned integer literals that resemble Unix epoch placeholders, which could be placeholders but are not inherently malicious. Overall, the code is straightforward and does not exhibit signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple static configuration object defining a shared tenant. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present. It appears to be a benign setup snippet.",
