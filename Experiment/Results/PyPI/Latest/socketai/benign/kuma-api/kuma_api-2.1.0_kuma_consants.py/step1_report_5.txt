  "purpose": "Define a shared tenant configuration object with fixed properties.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading observed).",
  "sets": "None (no untrusted data is assigned or manipulated).",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink since no external input or data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of zero-valued timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt) as integers instead of proper date formats; no other suspicious or unusual code features.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a Python dictionary with static values representing a shared tenant. All values are hardcoded constants, including UUIDs and timestamps set to zero. There are no external inputs, data processing, or dynamic behavior. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions are present. The structure appears to be a simple configuration or constant definition. The use of zero timestamps might indicate placeholders or incomplete data but does not constitute malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static configuration object with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not involve external data, dynamic execution, or sensitive operations. No malware or security issues are detected.",
