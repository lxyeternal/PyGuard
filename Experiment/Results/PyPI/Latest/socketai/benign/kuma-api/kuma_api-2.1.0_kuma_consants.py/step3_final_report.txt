  "purpose": "Static configuration dictionary defining a shared tenant with placeholder timestamps.",
  "sources": "No external input or dynamic data; static dictionary with hardcoded values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Timestamps 'createdAt' and 'updatedAt' are numeric literals (e.g., 0000000000000), which are placeholders and could cause runtime errors; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static dictionary with fixed attributes, including placeholder timestamps as large integers. No external input, code execution, or malicious behavior is present. The timestamps are syntactically valid but likely placeholders; no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code's benign nature is confirmed across multiple reports, with minor concerns about placeholder data potentially causing runtime issues but not security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration object with placeholder timestamps. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The main concern is the placeholder data, which should be replaced with valid timestamps for proper operation. Overall, the security risk is negligible, and the malware score is zero.",
