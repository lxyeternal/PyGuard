  "purpose": "Define a shared tenant configuration object with static attributes",
  "sources": "No input or data read; static data assignment",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data usage",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from source to sink",
  "anomalies": "Use of numeric literals for timestamps (potentially placeholders), but no malicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code declares a dictionary representing a shared tenant with fixed attributes. The 'createdAt' and 'updatedAt' fields are set to numeric literals that appear to be placeholders, which might indicate incomplete implementation or dummy data. No external input, environment variables, or sensitive data handling are present. There are no suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. The static data seems benign and typical for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static data definition for a tenant object with placeholder timestamps. No malicious behavior, security issues, or anomalies are detected.",
