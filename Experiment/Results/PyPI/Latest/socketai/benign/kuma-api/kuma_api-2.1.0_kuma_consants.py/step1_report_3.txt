  "purpose": "Define a shared tenant configuration object with static properties.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code only assigns a static dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing; no untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to sensitive operations; static data is assigned directly.",
  "anomalies": "The 'createdAt' and 'updatedAt' fields are assigned numeric literals that resemble timestamp placeholders but are invalid syntax without quotes or proper formatting. No secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary named SHARED_TENANT with static properties, including identifiers, flags, and timestamps. The timestamps are numeric literals that appear to be placeholders but are syntactically invalid in Python without quotes or proper formatting, which could cause runtime errors. There are no inputs, data leaks, or suspicious code behaviors. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The static nature of the data indicates it is a configuration object rather than executable logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple static configuration dictionary defining a shared tenant. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor concern is the invalid timestamp format, which could cause errors, but this is unrelated to security or malicious intent.",
