  "purpose": "Static configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder, defining project info, extensions, paths, language, and theme options.",
  "sources": "Assignment of project metadata, list of extensions, path configurations, language setting, theme options.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; configuration data used internally for documentation setup.",
  "flows": "Static data assignments without dynamic or external data flow; no source-to-sink data transfer involving untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static Sphinx configuration file with no dynamic code, external data fetching, or obfuscated elements. All variables are assigned fixed strings or data structures. No input handling, network calls, or embedded scripts are present. The code's purpose is solely to configure documentation build parameters. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are identified. The code's structure and content are typical for such configuration files, and the absence of any suspicious patterns or code anomalies confirms its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration file for Sphinx documentation with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe and standard nature, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for use.",
