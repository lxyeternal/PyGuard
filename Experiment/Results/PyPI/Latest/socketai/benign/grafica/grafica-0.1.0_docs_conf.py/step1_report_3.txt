  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder, defining project info, extensions, and HTML options.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources; static configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions, as no untrusted input handling is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration file for Sphinx with static variable assignments. There are no inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious code behavior. All data appears hardcoded and standard for a documentation project setup.",
  "conclusion": "The file is a benign configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only sets project parameters and options for Sphinx, with no external data handling or insecure practices.",
