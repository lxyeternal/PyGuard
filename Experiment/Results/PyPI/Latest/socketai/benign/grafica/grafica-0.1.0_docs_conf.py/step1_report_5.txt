  "purpose": "Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder",
  "sources": "Constants and string assignments such as project info, copyright, author, release, extensions, templates_path, exclude_patterns, language, html_theme, html_theme_options",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; the code only sets configuration parameters and does not handle untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration values are static and predefined",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Sphinx configuration file setting static parameters for documentation generation. It specifies project details, paths, themes, and options. There are no inputs from external sources or user data, and no dynamic code execution or network activity. All values are static and conventional for such configuration files.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
