  "purpose": "Configure and set up a Sphinx documentation theme named 'grafica' by retrieving its version and registering the theme path.",
  "sources": "Import of 'version' from importlib.metadata, call to version('grafica') to get package version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable manipulations beyond reading package version.",
  "flows": "Retrieval of package version (source) used in the return dictionary for configuration purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and uses standard Python library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, retrieves the version of the 'grafica' package, and registers a theme with the app object. The version() call is standard for Python packaging and does not involve untrusted input. The theme path is resolved using Path, which is safe. The function returns a configuration dictionary with version info and safety flags.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical setup function for a Sphinx theme, with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected. It only reads package metadata and registers a theme path.",
