  "purpose": "Set up a Sphinx documentation theme configuration by retrieving package version and adding a theme.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version() function call, __file__ variable",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or external connections",
  "flows": "The version from package metadata flows into the returned dictionary; __file__ is used to determine path",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard code structure for Sphinx setup",
  "analysis": "The code imports Path from pathlib and version from importlib.metadata, then defines a setup function. It retrieves the package version for 'grafica' using version(), resolves the current file path for theme location, and returns configuration settings. No user input, network activity, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code appears to be a typical Sphinx theme setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx theme setup snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely retrieves package version information and configures theme paths.",
