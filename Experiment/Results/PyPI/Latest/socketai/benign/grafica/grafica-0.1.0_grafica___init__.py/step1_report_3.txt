{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Sphinx documentation theme named 'grafica' by retrieving its version and registering the theme directory.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version using importlib.metadata.version('grafica') and accesses the current file's path via __file__.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The version obtained from importlib.metadata flows into the returned dictionary. The path resolution flows from __file__ to the theme registration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments are present. The use of __file__ and importlib.metadata is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a setup function for a Sphinx theme. It retrieves the package version securely through standard library functions. It registers the theme directory by resolving the current file path. The returned dictionary contains version info and safety flags. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Sphinx theme setup script with no malicious or security risks identified. It simply reads package metadata and registers a theme directory, using safe and standard practices.",
