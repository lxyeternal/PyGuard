  "purpose": "Configure a Sphinx theme by retrieving package version and setting theme directory.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() for package version, __file__ for current file path",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved",
  "flows": "version() retrieves package info; __file__ provides path; setup returns configuration dictionary",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard libraries; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, retrieves package version, resolves theme directory path, and returns a configuration dict. It performs no network, no user input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. All signals indicate benign, standard configuration code. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate; the slight overestimation of securityRisk as 0.1 in one report is unwarranted given the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Sphinx theme setup script with no malicious or security-risky behavior. All reports correctly identify its safety, with minor overestimation of risk in one case. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 for accuracy.",
