  "flows": "The version information is obtained from package metadata and used to populate the returned dictionary; no data flows from external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path and version, retrieves the package version for 'grafica', and registers a theme with the application. It uses standard library functions and straightforward logic. No external input, network activity, or insecure operations are involved. The code appears to be standard setup code for a Sphinx theme without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a configuration purpose for a documentation theme. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
