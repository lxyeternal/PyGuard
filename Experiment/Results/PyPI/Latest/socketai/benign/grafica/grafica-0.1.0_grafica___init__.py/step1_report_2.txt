  "purpose": "Configure a Sphinx documentation theme named 'grafica' by retrieving its version and setting theme parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version using importlib.metadata.version('grafica') and the current file path using __file__.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data or execute external commands; it mainly accesses package metadata and filesystem paths.",
  "flows": "The version retrieved from the package metadata is used internally to set the theme version. No untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. Use of importlib.metadata to get package version is standard. No obfuscation or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path for filesystem operations and version to retrieve package version. The setup function obtains the current package version, then adds a theme to a documentation app, setting theme parameters and returning a configuration dictionary. The code performs standard operations for configuring a Sphinx theme without any signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration snippet for a Sphinx documentation theme with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
