  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard plugin registration with no malicious intent. The main security risk stems from trusting the external shared library. The malware and obfuscation scores are justified at zero. The security risk score should be set around 0.4 to reflect the potential for supply chain issues, especially given the use of an experimental API. Implementing checksum verification for the shared library is recommended to mitigate this risk."
