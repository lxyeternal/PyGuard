  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with appropriate scoring. Report 4's obfuscation warrants caution, but without evidence of malicious payloads, its malware score should be slightly reduced. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified, with minor refinements recommended for report 4."
