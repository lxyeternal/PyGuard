{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for general data processing or utility functions, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from function arguments, file operations, environment variables, or network connections if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions, network transmission, file writing, or database queries, especially if untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input, files, env vars) to sinks (output, network, storage) through various processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or obfuscated code patterns detected. No unusual dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code's structure indicates standard programming constructs without obfuscation or suspicious patterns. No signs of malicious data handling, secret exfiltration, or harmful operations. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical, and no insecure practices such as unsafe SQL or insecure environment variable handling are evident. Lack of network activity or destructive commands suggests low likelihood of malicious intent. Due to absence of suspicious behavior and straightforward logic, confidence in benign analysis is high.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be normal, benign code with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
