  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, data reading functions, environment variables, network connections, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, system commands, file modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "Signs of obfuscation, incomplete or missing code, hardcoded strings, suspicious function calls.",
  "analysis": "The provided reports indicate that most code is either absent, incomplete, or straightforward. Report 1 notes signs of obfuscation but no malicious activity, assigning a malware score of 0.1 and obfuscation at 0.4, which is reasonable. Reports 2-5 acknowledge the lack of code or minimal content, with low scores for malware and obfuscation, and low security risk. The reasoning across reports is consistent, cautious, and justified given the evidence. No significant anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores align with the assessments, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits minimal to no malicious behavior, with some signs of obfuscation in one report. Overall, the security risk is low, and the assessments are appropriate. The lack of concrete code limits definitive conclusions, but current scores and reasoning are justified.",
