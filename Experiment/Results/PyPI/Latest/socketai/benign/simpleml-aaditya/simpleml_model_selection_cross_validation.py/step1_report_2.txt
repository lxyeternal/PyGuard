  "purpose": "Implementing a cross-validation procedure for evaluating a machine learning model's performance.",
  "sources": "Data inputs: X, y (training features and labels).",
  "sinks": "Model's fit and predict methods; computed scores.",
  "flows": "Data from X, y flows into model.fit; predictions flow from model.predict; results stored in scores.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. Use of simple splitting logic is straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code performs k-fold cross-validation by splitting data into equal parts, training the model on combined training folds, and evaluating on the validation fold. The scoring metric is accuracy, calculated via direct comparison of predicted and true labels. No external data, network operations, or suspicious code patterns are present. Use of standard library for train_test_split is appropriate, though the imported function isn't used in the code shown. Overall, the code appears to be a typical implementation of cross-validation with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cross-validation routine for model evaluation with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It functions as intended for model validation purposes.",
