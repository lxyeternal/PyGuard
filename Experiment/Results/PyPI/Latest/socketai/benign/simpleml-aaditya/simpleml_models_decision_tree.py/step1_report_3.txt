{
  "purpose": "Implements a simple Decision Tree classifier with fixed prediction based on majority class; likely for educational or basic classification purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data 'X' and labels 'y' in the fit method; input data 'X' in the predict method.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Input data 'X' and 'y' are used to determine a majority class in fit; predict method outputs the same prediction for all inputs, based on stored majority class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears minimalistic, with no hidden or unusual behavior. No use of environment variables, external network calls, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The class defines a very simplified Decision Tree that only stores the majority class of the training labels during fit. The predict method outputs this majority class for all input samples. There is no complex logic, no external data handling, no code injection, or malicious routines. The code structure and behavior are straightforward and transparent. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimalistic, non-malicious implementation of a baseline classifier that predicts the majority class. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and benign.",
