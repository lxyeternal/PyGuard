{
  "purpose": "A minimal decision tree classifier that predicts the majority class for all inputs.",
  "sources": "Input features `X` and labels `y` in the `fit()` method.",
  "sinks": "Return value in `predict()` method; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into `fit()` to determine majority class, which is then returned in `predict()` for all inputs.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a trivial classifier that always predicts the most common label. It does not perform any decision tree logic, external data access, or malicious routines. The implementation is transparent and simple, with no obfuscation or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware score is justified as 0, and the security risk score should be 0, reflecting the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in some reports appears overly cautious given the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, trivial classifier with no malicious or security concerns. All reports accurately assess its benign nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0 for consistency and correctness.",
