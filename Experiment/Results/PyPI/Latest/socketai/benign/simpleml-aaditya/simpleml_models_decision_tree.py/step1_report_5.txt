{
  "purpose": "A simple DecisionTree class for fitting and predicting a basic decision rule based on majority class.",
  "sources": "Input data X and labels y in the fit method; input features X in the predict method.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "fit method reads y to determine majority class; predict method outputs the same prediction for all inputs.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no use of external libraries, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code. The fit method only stores the majority class; no real decision tree logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimalistic decision tree class that predicts the majority class for any input. It does not perform any complex computations, tree building, or external data handling. No external data sources, network calls, or security-sensitive operations are present. The implementation appears intentionally simplistic and does not include malicious behavior. No obfuscation, malicious code, or anomalous logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, simple implementation of a dummy decision classifier with no malicious intent or security risks. It neither leaks data nor performs any harmful actions.",
