  "purpose": "Implement a simple decision tree classifier with fixed prediction logic.",
  "sources": "Input features X and target labels y in the fit method.",
  "sinks": "Predicted output in the predict method.",
  "flows": "fit method processes y to determine majority class; predict method returns fixed prediction for all inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimal DecisionTree class with methods to fit and predict. The fit method sets the 'predict' key in the tree dictionary to the most common label in y, which is a benign operation. The predict method returns this fixed label for all inputs, indicating a trivial classifier. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code structure is straightforward and lacks any obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement a simple, non-malicious classifier that always predicts the majority class. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks.",
