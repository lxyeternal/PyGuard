{
  "purpose": "Implement a simple decision tree classifier with fixed prediction based on training data majority class.",
  "sources": "Data inputs: X (features), y (labels); no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Return statement in predict method; no untrusted data outputs or external communications.",
  "flows": "fit method processes y to determine majority class; predict method returns this class for all inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. The model's logic is overly simplistic, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimal decision tree class that records the most common label in the training data and always predicts this label. It does not include external data access, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The predict method simply repeats the stored prediction, indicating no data leakage, no malicious data handling, or suspicious behavior. The simplicity suggests it's a basic classifier without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of a trivial classifier with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
