  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing provided code snippets or descriptions for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data, configuration files, environment variables, network calls, data processing functions",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, file write operations, system commands, database queries, environment variable access",
  "flows": "Input data flows from sources to sinks through various functions, potentially leading to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual control flow, hidden backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for malicious patterns, suspicious network activity, obfuscation, and insecure practices. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or anomalies were detected across the reports. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.2-0.3) are consistent with the benign assessments. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited code snippets or descriptions. The overall evaluation indicates a low security risk with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent and justified in their benign assessment. No modifications are necessary. The dependency appears safe based on the provided information.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
