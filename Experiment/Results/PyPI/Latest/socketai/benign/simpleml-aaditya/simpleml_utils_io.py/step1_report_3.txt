  "purpose": "Provides functions to save and load a model object using pickle serialization.",
  "sources": "Reads from the 'filename' argument in open() calls for reading data.",
  "sinks": "Uses pickle.load() to deserialize data from the file, which could execute malicious code if the file is tampered with.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> open() -> pickle.load() -> return model",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious imports or unusual code patterns. The use of pickle is notable since it can execute arbitrary code during unpickling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: save_model and load_model. Both functions operate on a filename provided as an argument, opening the file in write ('wb') or read ('rb') mode. The save_model function serializes the model object using pickle.dump, and load_model deserializes it using pickle.load. The use of pickle for serialization/deserialization is inherently risky if the input file can be controlled by an attacker, as unpickling can execute arbitrary code. There are no safeguards such as validation or sandboxing, making the load_model function potentially dangerous if used on untrusted files.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is straightforward and not malicious, but the use of pickle for loading models introduces a security risk if the filename points to untrusted or tampered files. The code does not perform any malicious actions on its own but can be exploited if untrusted data is loaded. It is recommended to use safer serialization formats or validate files before unpickling.",
