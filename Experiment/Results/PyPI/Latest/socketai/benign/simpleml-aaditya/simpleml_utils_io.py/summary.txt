  "conclusion": "The code is safe if used with trusted files but can be exploited if untrusted pickle data is loaded. It does not contain malicious code itself. The main concern is the unsafe use of pickle, which can lead to remote code execution. The malware score should be low (near 0), but the security risk score should be high (~0.8)."
