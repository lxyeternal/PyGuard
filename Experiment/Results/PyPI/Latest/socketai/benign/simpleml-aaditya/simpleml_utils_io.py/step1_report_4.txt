  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to save and load machine learning models using pickle.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'filename' parameter in both load_model and save_model functions.",
  "sinks": "The load_model function deserializes data from a file, which could potentially execute malicious code if the file is maliciously crafted. The save_model function writes data to a file, but is less likely to be exploited unless the filename is controlled by an attacker.",
  "flows": "Untrusted filename input flows from the parameter into open() calls; pickle.load() on data read from files can execute arbitrary code if the pickle data is maliciously crafted.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies solely on pickle, which is known to be unsafe if loading untrusted data, as it can execute arbitrary code during unpickling. No validation or sandboxing is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions to serialize and deserialize models with pickle. The load_model function reads from a filename and unpickles the data, which is inherently unsafe if the file content is malicious or tampered with, as pickle can execute arbitrary code during unpickling. The save_model function serializes data to a file and poses less risk unless filenames are externally controlled, potentially leading to overwriting critical files. The code does not include any validation, sanitization, or security measures to prevent the execution of malicious pickle payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code facilitates model serialization/deserialization but uses pickle without safeguards, posing a high security risk if untrusted data is loaded. The load_model function is particularly dangerous due to pickle's inherent vulnerabilities. Overall, this code should not be used with untrusted pickle files, as it can execute arbitrary malicious code.",
