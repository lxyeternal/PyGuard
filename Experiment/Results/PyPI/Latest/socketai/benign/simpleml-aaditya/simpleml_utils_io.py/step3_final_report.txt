  "sources": "File open/read operations in save_model and load_model functions.",
  "sinks": "pickle.dump and pickle.load functions which execute code during unpickling.",
  "flows": "Data is passed to pickle.dump during save; pickle.load reads data and executes code during load.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation. The main concern is the use of pickle for untrusted data, which can execute arbitrary code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple save/load functions using pickle. The primary security issue is that pickle can execute arbitrary code if loading malicious data. The code itself contains no malicious payloads or obfuscation. The risk arises only when untrusted data is loaded, which can lead to remote code execution. The functions are intended for trusted environments, but misuse with untrusted data poses significant security risks. The malware score should reflect potential for malicious activity, not that the code is malicious per se. Obfuscation is absent; the code is straightforward. The security risk is high due to pickle's inherent vulnerabilities, warranting a score around 0.8.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe if used with trusted files but can be exploited if untrusted pickle data is loaded. It does not contain malicious code itself. The main concern is the unsafe use of pickle, which can lead to remote code execution. The malware score should be low (near 0), but the security risk score should be high (~0.8).",
