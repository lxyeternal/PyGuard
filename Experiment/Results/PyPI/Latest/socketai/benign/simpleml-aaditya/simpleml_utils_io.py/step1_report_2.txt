  "purpose": "Provide functions to save and load machine learning models using pickle serialization.",
  "sources": "Filename input parameters in save_model and load_model functions.",
  "sinks": "pickle.load function reads from files, which can potentially execute malicious code if loading untrusted pickle data.",
  "flows": "Filename input -> open file -> pickle.dump or pickle.load -> data serialization/deserialization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle module, which is known for executing arbitrary code during unpickling if the data is malicious. No validation or sandboxing present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple wrappers for saving and loading models via pickle. While this is standard practice, pickle inherently executes code during unpickling, posing security risks if the input file is untrusted or malicious. No input validation or sanitization is performed. The functions assume trusted data sources. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior is present. The code itself is straightforward, but its use with untrusted files can be dangerous.",
  "conclusion": "The code is not malicious by itself but is risky if used with untrusted pickle files. The use of pickle for loading models without validation is a security concern, as it can execute arbitrary code during unpickling. Recommend caution when loading files and advise against using untrusted sources.",
