  "purpose": "Functions to save and load a model object to/from a file using pickle.",
  "sources": "File open operations for reading ('rb') and writing ('wb')",
  "sinks": "pickle.load, which deserializes data from files that can execute arbitrary code if the pickle data is malicious",
  "flows": "save_model serializes the model to a file; load_model deserializes data from a file into a Python object",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle for serialization/deserialization; pickle is inherently unsafe if loading untrusted data, but in this context, it's intended for trusted model files",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward functions for serializing and deserializing models using pickle. While pickle is known for security risks when loading untrusted data, in this case, the functions appear designed for trusted sources. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The use of pickle itself is a potential risk if used improperly, but within this controlled context, it does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for saving and loading models with pickle. It does not contain malicious behavior, but its use of pickle warrants caution if loaded data sources are untrusted. Overall, it appears safe if used correctly with trusted files.",
