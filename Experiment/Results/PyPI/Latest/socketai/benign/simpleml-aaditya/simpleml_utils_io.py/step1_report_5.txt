  "purpose": "Provide functions to save and load machine learning models using pickle serialization.",
  "sources": "File open operations reading 'filename' parameter for reading or writing binary data.",
  "sinks": "pickle.load() which deserializes data from the file; potential for executing malicious code during unpickling.",
  "flows": "save_model writes data to a file; load_model reads and deserializes data from a file, executing any code embedded in the pickle data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle for serialization/deserialization without any security checks; no validation or sandboxing; no input validation on filename.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward functions to serialize and deserialize models using pickle. While the save function is relatively safe, the load function is inherently risky because unpickling data from an untrusted source can execute arbitrary code. There are no additional security measures such as validation, sandboxing, or cryptographic verification. The functions depend entirely on the filename provided, which could be manipulated to load malicious pickle data. This pattern is known to be vulnerable if untrusted pickle data is loaded. Overall, the code itself does not contain malicious behavior but is a significant security risk if used improperly, especially with untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides basic save/load functions for models but uses pickle for deserialization, which is inherently unsafe when loading data from untrusted sources. There is no malicious intent in the code itself, but it poses a security risk if used improperly, especially with untrusted pickle files. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
