  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python module or script performing typical functions, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables and potential user input, though no specific input functions are visible. Data is read from os.environ, sys.argv, or similar modules if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, subprocess calls, or system commands. However, no explicit usage of such sinks is identified in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables or inputs to processing functions, but no suspicious or untrusted data flows to dangerous sinks are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are detected. The code structure appears typical and well-formed.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis indicates the code follows standard programming patterns without malicious constructs. No signs of obfuscation, unusual dynamic execution, or hidden backdoors are evident. The code’s structure, imports, and operations appear legitimate. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or unauthorized system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, standard Python script or module with no suspicious patterns detected.",
