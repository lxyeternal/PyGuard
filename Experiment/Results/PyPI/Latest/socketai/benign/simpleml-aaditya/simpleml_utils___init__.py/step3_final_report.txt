  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, data input points, external data fetches, environment variables, network calls.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, system calls, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via code execution paths, data processing routines, or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual data flows, backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently indicate benign code with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Malware scores are 0 across reports, matching their conclusions. Confidence levels are appropriate; minor adjustments to risk scores from 0.2 to approximately 0.2-0.3 could better reflect the low inherent risk. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent is present. The reasoning in each report is sound, and the scores are justified based on the descriptions provided.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears safe with no detected malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the benign assessments. Minor score adjustments could be considered, but overall, the reports are accurate and reliable.",
