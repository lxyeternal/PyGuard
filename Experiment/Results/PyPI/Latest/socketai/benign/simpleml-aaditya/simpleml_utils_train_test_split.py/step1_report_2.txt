{
  "purpose": "The code implements a function to split datasets into training and testing subsets for machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays X and labels y, as well as optional parameters test_size and random_state.",
  "sinks": "Does not contain any sinks that lead to data leaks, external connections, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Reads data from X and y; processes these inputs to generate train/test splits; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Uses numpy for random seed setting and shuffling; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior. The code performs a standard data split operation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard train_test_split function similar to sklearn's implementation. It sets a random seed if provided, creates an index array, shuffles it, and splits data accordingly. No obfuscation, no external data access, and no malicious patterns are present. The code performs straightforward data manipulation without side effects or suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of dataset splitting with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
