  "purpose": "To split datasets into training and testing subsets for machine learning purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters X, y, and optional random_state; reads dataset sizes and data collections.",
  "sinks": "Uses numpy functions for random shuffling and data partitioning; no external or untrusted data output observed.",
  "flows": "Input data -> dataset size and seed initialization -> data shuffling -> data partitioning -> output datasets.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is standard implementation of train-test split using numpy.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes the random seed with 'random_state' for reproducibility, creates an index array, shuffles it, and splits data into training and testing sets based on 'test_size'. Uses list comprehensions for slicing data. No suspicious or malicious operations are present, and no external network or file interactions are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard dataset splitting function without malicious intent or security risks. No anomalies or malware detected. It appears safe and legitimate.",
