  "purpose": "To split data into training and testing sets for machine learning models.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: X, y, test_size, random_state",
  "sinks": "None evident; no output or data leaks observed",
  "flows": "Input data (X, y) -> data splitting logic -> output training and testing datasets",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors; no obfuscated code or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and defines a function to split datasets into training and testing parts. It seeds the numpy random generator if 'random_state' is provided, shuffles indices, and slices data accordingly. The approach is standard for data splitting. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or hidden code. Usage of numpy functions appears legitimate. The function is straightforward, with no suspicious or anomalous code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard train-test split using numpy, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears safe and typical for data preprocessing in machine learning workflows.",
