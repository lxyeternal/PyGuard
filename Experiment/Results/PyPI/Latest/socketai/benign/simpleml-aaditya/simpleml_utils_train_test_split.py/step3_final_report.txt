  "purpose": "A utility function to split datasets into training and testing subsets for machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays X and y, and uses numpy's random seed and shuffle functions for data shuffling.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are slices of the input data; no external data sinks or network operations are involved.",
  "flows": "Source data (X, y) -> numpy seed and shuffle -> index array -> slicing via list comprehensions -> output datasets.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard train-test split by shuffling indices with numpy, then slicing data accordingly. It uses common practices without obfuscation or malicious behavior. No external calls, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical data splitting functions. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a dataset splitting utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
