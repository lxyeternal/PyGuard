  "purpose": "A utility function to split datasets into training and testing subsets for machine learning purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the input datasets X and y, as well as the random seed for reproducibility.",
  "targets": "Uses the shuffled indices to split the datasets into training and test sets.",
  "flows": "Input datasets X, y -> shuffle indices -> split indices -> select data for training and testing based on indices.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code uses standard numpy functions for shuffling and splitting data.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a seed for reproducibility, creates an index array, shuffles it, and splits the data accordingly. All operations are standard and intended for data splitting. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious behavior. The code does not contain any malicious or obfuscated elements. It is a straightforward dataset splitting function.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a common data splitting task without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard utility function for machine learning workflows.",
