{
  "purpose": "The function is designed to split datasets into training and testing subsets for machine learning purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads the input datasets X and y, and optionally uses a seed for randomness.",
  "sinks": "Uses np.random.seed() and np.random.shuffle() which are deterministic and not sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Inputs (X, y) flow through index creation and shuffling, resulting in partitioned datasets.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; the implementation is straightforward and standard for train-test splitting.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and defines a function to split data into train and test sets. It sets the seed for reproducibility if provided, creates an index array, shuffles it, and then slices it to form training and test indices. It then constructs the train and test datasets by selecting elements from X and y based on these indices. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The use of numpy's random functions is standard and appropriate for this purpose. The code does not include network calls, data exfiltration, or system modification, indicating no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of train-test data splitting with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
