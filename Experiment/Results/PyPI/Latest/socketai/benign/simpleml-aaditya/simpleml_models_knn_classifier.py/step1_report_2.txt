{
  "purpose": "Implement a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier for supervised learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data to fit() method (training data), input data to predict() method.",
  "sinks": "None evident; code does not write or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input to fit() and predict() methods, processed within the class for classification.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears straightforward and uses standard numpy operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple KNN classifier that stores training data via fit(), computes Euclidean distances during predict(), and determines class labels based on majority voting among nearest neighbors. All operations are standard for KNN implementation; no suspicious or malicious behavior is observed. There are no external data transmissions, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Usage of numpy for calculations is typical and safe. The logic is transparent and aligns with common machine learning practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a KNN classifier with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical data processing without external communications or sensitive operations. Overall, it is safe and benign.",
