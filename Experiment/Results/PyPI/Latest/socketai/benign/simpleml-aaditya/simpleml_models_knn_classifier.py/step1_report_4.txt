{
  "purpose": "A k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classifier implementation for supervised machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Inputs to the fit() and predict() methods, specifically the datasets X, y, and new data points X for prediction.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No output or data handling that transmits data externally or interacts with the system beyond standard calculations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input datasets (X, y) into class attributes during fit(). During predict(), new data points are processed to compute distances, find nearest neighbors, and produce predictions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The code performs standard kNN classification logic without external system calls or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward kNN classifier with fit() storing training data and predict() calculating Euclidean distances to determine nearest neighbors. The implementation uses numpy for numerical operations and sorting, which are standard. There are no indications of malicious behavior, external data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to serve a typical machine learning purpose without any anomalies or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a kNN classifier without malicious or suspicious behavior. It contains no hardcoded secrets, no external network interactions, and performs legitimate classification tasks. Overall, it appears safe and purpose-driven.",
