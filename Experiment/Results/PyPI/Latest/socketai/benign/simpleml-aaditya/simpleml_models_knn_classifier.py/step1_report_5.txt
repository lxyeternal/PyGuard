  "purpose": "Implementation of a simple k-Nearest Neighbors classifier for supervised learning.",
  "sources": "Input data to fit() and predict() methods, specifically the features (X) and labels (y).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data that lead to data leaks or harmful actions; the code only processes data for classification.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the fit() and predict() methods, where input arrays are stored or used for calculations. The primary flow is from input data to predicted labels.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behavior detected. The code performs standard k-NN operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic k-NN classifier with methods to fit training data and predict labels for new data points. It uses numpy for numerical operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious side-effects. No network operations, no data exfiltration, and no code injection mechanisms are present. The logic is straightforward and typical for this kind of machine learning implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a k-NN classifier with no malicious intent or security risks. It processes data for classification without performing any harmful actions or security violations.",
