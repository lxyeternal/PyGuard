{
  "purpose": "Implement a simple k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier for classification tasks.",
  "sources": "Inputs to fit() method (X, y) for training data; Inputs to predict() method (X) for prediction data.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external outputs; standard data processing only.",
  "flows": "Data flows from fit() and predict() inputs through internal variables to produce predictions; no external data flows or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; uses standard numpy operations; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic KNN classifier class with methods for training (fit) and prediction (predict). It converts input data to numpy arrays, computes Euclidean distances for each point in predict(), and determines the most common label among nearest neighbors. No use of external resources, network calls, or system modifications are present. The implementation appears straightforward and standard, with no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a KNN classifier without any malicious behavior or security risks. There are no suspicious data flows or anomalies. It appears safe for general use.",
