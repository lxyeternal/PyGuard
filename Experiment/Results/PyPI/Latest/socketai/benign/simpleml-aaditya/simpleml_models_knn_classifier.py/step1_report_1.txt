{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classifier for supervised machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via the fit() and predict() methods, specifically from the parameters X and y provided to fit, and X provided to predict.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network communication, file writing, or system modification are present. The code does not output or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (X, y) into internal attributes (X_train, y_train) during fit(). The predict() method computes distances based on these stored training data, then outputs predicted labels.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscation, and no suspicious dynamic execution. The code is a standard implementation of a kNN classifier using numpy, with straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for k-Nearest Neighbors classification, initializing with a parameter k. The fit() method stores training data as numpy arrays. The predict() method converts input to numpy arrays, then for each point calculates Euclidean distances to training points, finds the nearest neighbors, and assigns the most common label among these neighbors. The implementation appears correct and typical for such an algorithm. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or sabotage behaviors. The code does not contain any network operations, system modifications, or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of a kNN classifier with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is safe and suitable for use in machine learning workflows.",
