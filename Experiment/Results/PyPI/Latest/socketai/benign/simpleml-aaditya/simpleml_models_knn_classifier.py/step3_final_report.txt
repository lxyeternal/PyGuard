{
  "purpose": "A straightforward implementation of a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier using numpy, intended for classification tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data provided to fit() and predict() methods, specifically the feature matrix X and labels y.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not transmit data externally or write to files, only processes data internally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into internal numpy arrays, then through distance calculations and voting mechanisms within predict().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is clear, standard, and free of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, transparent implementation of a kNN classifier. It initializes with parameter k, fits by storing training data, and predicts by computing Euclidean distances, selecting nearest neighbors, and voting for labels. No external communications, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The logic is correct and standard for such algorithms. No anomalies or security issues are detected. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a kNN classifier with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
