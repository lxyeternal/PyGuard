  "purpose": "Defines measurement units for length and rotation, and a class to combine these units.",
  "sources": "Enum definitions for Length and Rotation, constructor of UnitMode class",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external data handling",
  "flows": "Instantiation of Length and Rotation enums, passing them to UnitMode constructor",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward enum and class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code defines two enums with string values representing units and a simple class that holds instances of these enums. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code is purely a data model with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is simple and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data structure for measurement units with no malicious or security concerns. The provided reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
