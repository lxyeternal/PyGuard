{
  "purpose": "Define enumerations for length and rotation units, and a class to represent a unit mode combining these units.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources; it only defines classes and enums.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no data processing, output, or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or data manipulations; the code only sets up data structures.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward enumeration and class definitions with no unusual or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Enum classes for length and rotation units, with string values representing unit types. It also defines a simple class 'UnitMode' that stores instances of these enums. There are no input/output operations, network activity, or data processing that could be malicious. The code is standard, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of class and enum definitions for managing measurement units. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
