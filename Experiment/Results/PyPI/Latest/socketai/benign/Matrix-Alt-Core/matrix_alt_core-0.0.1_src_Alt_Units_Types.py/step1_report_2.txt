  "purpose": "Define enumerations for length and rotation units, and a class to represent a unit mode with specified length and rotation types.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and enum attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks or external data processing points.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of UnitMode objects from Length and Rotation enum values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; enums and class are straightforward. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enums for length and rotation units and a class to combine these units. There are no input/output operations, no data flow to external systems, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious functions. The implementation appears purely for data representation with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of enums and a simple class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign data model setup for handling units.",
