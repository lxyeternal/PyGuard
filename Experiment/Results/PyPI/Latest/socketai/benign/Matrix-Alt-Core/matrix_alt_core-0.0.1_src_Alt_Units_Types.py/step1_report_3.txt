{
  "purpose": "Defines enumerations for length and rotation units, and a class to represent a combined unit mode.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only defines classes and enums.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or operations that process untrusted data or perform output actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; class attributes are set internally without processing external input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated or malicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward definition of enums and a simple class constructor with type annotations. It contains no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as an enumeration and data container for unit modes. It does not contain malicious intent or security risks.",
