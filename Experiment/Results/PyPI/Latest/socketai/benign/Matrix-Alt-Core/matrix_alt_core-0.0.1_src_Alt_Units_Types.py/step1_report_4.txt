  "purpose": "Define enumerations for length and rotation units and a class to represent a mode combining these units.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions within Length and Rotation enums, constructor of UnitMode class accepting enum instances.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data processing, network, or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of UnitMode with Length and Rotation enum values; no flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Enum classes for length and rotation units, and a simple class that holds instances of these enums. There are no data inputs, no external calls, no sensitive operations. The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured definition of data types for a larger system. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign enumeration and data container implementation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
