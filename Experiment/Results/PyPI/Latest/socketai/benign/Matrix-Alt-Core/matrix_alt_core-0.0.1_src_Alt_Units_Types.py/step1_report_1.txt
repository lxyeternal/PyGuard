  "purpose": "Define enums for length and rotation types and a class to represent a unit mode combining these types.",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions and the __init__ method of UnitMode class",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the class is used for data representation only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines two enums, Length and Rotation, with string values representing measurement units. It then defines a class UnitMode that combines instances of these enums to specify a unit configuration. All constructs are standard, and the code appears to serve as a simple data model without any dynamic code execution, external data handling, or potential malicious behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are involved, and the code does not perform network operations, file manipulations, or sensitive data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data structure implementation for representing measurement units. There is no malicious behavior, no security risks, and it appears to be a safe utility module.",
