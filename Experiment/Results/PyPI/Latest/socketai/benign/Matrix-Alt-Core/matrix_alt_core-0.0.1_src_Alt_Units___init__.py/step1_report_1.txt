  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script or module, possibly performing data processing or utility functions. There are no explicit indications of malicious intent based on the visible code segments.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly evident; the code does not seem to read external data or user input directly. If it reads environment variables or external files, those are not specified here.",
  "sinks": "No evidence of data being sent over the network, written to system files, or other potential data leaks. The code does not perform system calls or network operations.",
  "flows": "There are no apparent source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity. Data appears to be handled internally within functions or variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hardcoded credentials, are evident from the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be straightforward and conventional. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. It does not include suspicious network or file operations, nor does it contain obfuscated code or hidden functionalities. Without additional context or external dependencies, it seems safe.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the visible code, there are no indications of malware or security risks. The code looks benign, with no malicious behavior or supply chain threats detected.",
