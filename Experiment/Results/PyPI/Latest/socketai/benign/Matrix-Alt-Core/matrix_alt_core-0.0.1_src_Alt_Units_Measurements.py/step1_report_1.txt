{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for handling lengths and rotations with conversions between different units and formats.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class methods and attributes during object creation and conversion functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network, file I/O, or system commands are present; no untrusted data processing is visible.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters in class methods to internal private attributes, then to output methods with conversions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code relies solely on mathematical conversions and class structures.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility classes for length and rotation measurements with conversion functions. It employs private attributes, static constructors, and straightforward conversion logic. There are no signs of malicious payloads, network activity, or suspicious logic. The classes do not interact with external systems, files, or network resources. No obfuscation or hidden code is detected. The code appears to be a standard implementation of measurement conversions with well-structured class methods.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for handling length and rotation measurements. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code segment. It functions solely for data representation and conversion without interacting with external systems or sensitive data.",
