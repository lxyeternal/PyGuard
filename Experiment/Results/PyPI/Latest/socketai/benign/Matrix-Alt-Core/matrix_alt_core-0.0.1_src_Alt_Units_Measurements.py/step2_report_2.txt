  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the findings, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as defining Length and Rotation classes with unit conversions, static constructors, and internal representations.\n- They consistently find no external data sources, sinks, or malicious behaviors.\n- They note the use of private attributes, controlled instantiation, and straightforward conversion logic.\n- No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- Malware scores are zero across all reports.\n- Security risk scores are very low or zero, with one report noting 0.1, likely due to the use of `__new__` and raising `AttributeError` to prevent direct instantiation, which is a common pattern for controlled object creation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's security posture:\n\n- **Code Behavior & Logic:**  \n  The code strictly handles data encapsulation, unit conversions, and equality checks. It does not perform any I/O, network activity, or external data processing. The methods are straightforward and do not execute any dynamic code or system commands.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:**  \n  No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or hidden behaviors. The code uses standard Python features, and the imported modules appear to be trusted (assuming local modules `Alt.Units` and `Types` are safe).\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or attack vectors:**  \n  No evident vulnerabilities. The only slight concern is the use of `__new__` combined with raising `AttributeError` to prevent direct instantiation, but this is a common pattern for factory methods and does not introduce security issues.\n\n- **Supply Chain & External Risks:**  \n  The code does not interact with external systems, files, or network, so supply chain risks are minimal here.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring justification:\n\n- **Malware score (0):**  \n  No malicious activity or payloads detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score (0):**  \n  Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  The overall security risk is minimal; the highest observed is 0.1, which is reasonable given the pattern of controlled instantiation but still indicates negligible risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in the reports seem reasonable and consistent with the code analysis.\n- No changes are necessary; the code is benign, well-structured, and secure based on the provided snippets and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Personal assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Security risk score:** 0.1 (due to controlled instantiation pattern, but not a real risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign utility module for measurement conversions with no security concerns or malicious intent. The existing scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent in their benign assessment. The code does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behaviors. The scores reflect this understanding accurately.",
