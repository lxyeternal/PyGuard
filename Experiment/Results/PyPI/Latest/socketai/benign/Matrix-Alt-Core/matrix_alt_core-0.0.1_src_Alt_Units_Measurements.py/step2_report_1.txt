  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward utility for length and rotation conversions.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or network activity are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.\n- The code employs standard patterns, with controlled instantiation and internal state management.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, and no suspicious behavior is identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code is benign; no issues are present in the code logic or behavior.\n- The data flows are internal and safe.\n- No vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are detected.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- Minor: The `__eq__` method in `Rotation` compares `__deg` but the docstring incorrectly references \"inch value\" (likely a copy-paste error from `Length`). This is a documentation mistake, not a security flaw.\n- The `securityRisk` score in report 4 is 0.1, which seems slightly high for such a benign utility; perhaps it's a default or conservative estimate.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports is justified; no malicious code is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 or very close to 0, since the code does not perform any external interactions or handle untrusted data.\n\n### Additional Observations:\n- The use of `__new__` combined with raising `AttributeError` to prevent direct instantiation is a controlled pattern, not malicious.\n- No suspicious or hidden code, backdoors, or external dependencies are evident.\n- The imported modules `math`, `dataclasses`, and local modules `Alt.Units` and `Types` are assumed trusted.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The reports are accurate; no changes needed.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustment necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if conservative)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for measurement conversions with no security concerns.",
