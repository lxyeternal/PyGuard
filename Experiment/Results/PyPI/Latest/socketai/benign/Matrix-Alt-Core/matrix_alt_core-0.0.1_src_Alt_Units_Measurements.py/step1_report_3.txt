{
  "purpose": "Define classes for Length and Rotation with multiple factory methods for different units, including conversions and representations.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; static methods create instances from parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no system calls, network connections, or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "Object creation through class methods, no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secret data. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data classes with controlled instantiation via class methods, enforcing proper unit conversions. No external data input, no network or system calls, and no indication of malicious logic. The classes serve as data containers with conversion utilities, which are typical in mathematical or engineering applications. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured implementation of length and rotation representations with conversion methods. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
