  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility for measurement conversions with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing reports correctly identify its benign nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. and very low security risk scores. The only adjustment is reducing the securityRisk score in report 4 from 0.1 to 0, aligning with the benign analysis."
