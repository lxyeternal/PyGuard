{
  "purpose": "The code defines data classes for Length and Rotation, providing unit conversion and creation methods for length measurements and rotations. It appears to facilitate unit conversions and representations for measurement objects.",
  "sources": "None (no input or external data reading functions present).",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data sinks or network activity).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from sources to sinks as no input/output or external interactions are present).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code uses private attributes and static constructors as expected for encapsulation, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides data classes for Length and Rotation with methods for creating instances from different units, converting units, and representing measurements. It strictly performs internal calculations and representations, with no evident data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious operations. All functions are standard and related to measurement conversions and object management. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated logic are detected. The initial class design prevents direct instantiation, encouraging controlled object creation. No suspicious behavior, external data access, or potential attack vectors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of measurement units and conversions without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
