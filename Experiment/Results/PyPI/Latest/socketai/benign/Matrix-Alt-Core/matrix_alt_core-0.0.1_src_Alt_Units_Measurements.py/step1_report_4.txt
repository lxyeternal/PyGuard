{
  "purpose": "The code defines two classes, Length and Rotation, for handling measurements in different units and conversions between them.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; data is handled through method parameters and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs present; code mainly performs internal calculations and conversions.",
  "flows": "Conversions and instantiation flow from class methods creating objects with specific units, with no external data or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic object creation via __new__ combined with raising AttributeError to prevent direct instantiation is typical. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are evident. No obfuscation or unusual language features are present. All methods perform standard conversions and comparisons.",
  "analysis": "The code provides measurement classes with multiple constructors for various units, enforcing controlled instantiation. It performs standard mathematical conversions and equality checks based on internal state. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The code does not interact with external systems, network, or file I/O, nor does it handle untrusted input beyond method parameters. No hidden backdoors, suspicious network activity, or data theft mechanisms are present. The design appears consistent and secure, focusing solely on unit conversions and internal state management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of measurement and rotation classes with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or external communications.",
