  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign but executes external code without verification, representing a high supply chain security risk. The malware score should be increased to reflect the external code execution risk, though the internal code is not malicious. The overall security risk is high due to lack of validation mechanisms. The current scores in the reports are generally appropriate, but the malware score should be around 0.5, and the security risk around 0.8 to accurately reflect the external dependency risk."
