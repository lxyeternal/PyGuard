  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing or utility functions without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user input, or external files; no suspicious data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential network connections, file writes, or environment variable modifications; no malicious sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to sinks such as network or file outputs; no suspicious flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code shows no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The scores reflect a conservative assessment with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk score of 0.2, acknowledging limited context but no evidence of threat. Confidence is high given the lack of suspicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code is benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero. Overall, the dependency appears safe for use.",
