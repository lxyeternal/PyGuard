  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for general data processing or utility functions, but without further context, its specific purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input is read from function parameters, environment variables, or standard input; no external data sources are explicitly accessed.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, network sockets, or displays output; no explicit untrusted data sinks are evident without more context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output or storage points; no malicious or suspicious flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures; code structure appears straightforward with standard Python constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python functions and data manipulations, with no obfuscated or complex constructs. It does not include suspicious network calls, malicious commands, or hidden behaviors. No anomalous or malicious patterns are observed. The code's intent and data handling appear benign, though limited context reduces certainty.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to perform routine operations without any malicious intent.",
