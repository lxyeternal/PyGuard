  "purpose": "Retrieve and store the device's hostname and local IP address.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.socket(), socket.connect()",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data leading to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "socket.gethostname() and socket.connect() provide data used to define DEVICEHOSTNAME and DEVICEIP, but there are no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports socket and retrieves the hostname via socket.gethostname(). It then defines a function to determine the local IP address by creating a UDP socket, attempting to connect to Google's DNS server (8.8.8.8), and obtaining the socket's local address. If the connection fails, it defaults to localhost ('127.0.0.1'). Both hostname and IP are stored in constants. The logic is standard for obtaining device network information and does not perform any malicious actions or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward utility to obtain device network identifiers with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware.",
