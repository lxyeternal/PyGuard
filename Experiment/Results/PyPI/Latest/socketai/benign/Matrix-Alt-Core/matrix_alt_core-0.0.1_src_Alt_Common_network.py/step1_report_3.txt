  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or external transmissions observed; data is stored in variables only.",
  "flows": "socket.gethostname() and get_local_ip() functions collect data from system network interfaces, assigned to constants DEVICEHOSTNAME and DEVICEIP.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code or malicious intent apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code simply obtains the device's hostname and local IP address using standard socket library calls. It includes error handling for network failures. All operations are typical for network configuration scripts. No data is transmitted externally, stored insecurely, or used maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely for retrieving device network information. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
