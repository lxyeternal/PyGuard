  "purpose": "Retrieve the device's hostname and local IP address for network identification or configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.socket(), socket.connect()",
  "sinks": "socket.connect() (used to determine local IP by connecting to external address), socket.close()",
  "flows": "socket.gethostname() -> get_local_ip() -> socket.connect() -> gets local IP address -> stores in DEVICEIP",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a constant for the device hostname using socket.gethostname(). It also defines a function get_local_ip() that creates a UDP socket, attempts to connect to a public DNS server (8.8.8.8), and retrieves the local IP address from the socket's socketname. The socket is properly closed in a finally block. The obtained local IP is stored in DEVICEIP. The process is a common method for determining the local IP address without sending data over the network, as the connect() call doesn't actually transmit data but sets the socket's internal state. The code only reads system information and communicates with a well-known external address for network interface detection. There is no malicious intent, data leakage, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "This code safely retrieves the hostname and local IP address of the device for legitimate purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It appears to be a standard network utility snippet.",
