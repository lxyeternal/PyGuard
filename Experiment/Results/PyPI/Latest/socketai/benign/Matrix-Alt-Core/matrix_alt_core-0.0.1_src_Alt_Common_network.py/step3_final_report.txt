  "purpose": "Retrieve device hostname and local IP address for network identification.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname() and socket connection to 8.8.8.8:80 to determine local IP.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is transmitted or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Source: gethostname() and socket.connect() -> Sink: local variables storing hostname and IP.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code with standard socket usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports socket, retrieves hostname, and defines a function to determine local IP by connecting to an external DNS server. It handles exceptions gracefully, defaulting to localhost. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. External DNS connection is a common method for IP detection and does not pose significant security risks. The code is simple, clear, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for obtaining device hostname and IP address, with no malicious intent or security issues. The minor security risk score of 0.1 assigned in some reports is justified due to external DNS contact but does not indicate any threat. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
