  "purpose": "Retrieve and store the device's hostname and local IP address",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.socket(), socket.connect()",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data flows leading to external systems or sensitive data leaks",
  "flows": "socket.gethostname() assigns hostname; get_local_ip() creates socket, connects to external DNS, retrieves local IP",
  "anomalies": "None; standard use of socket library for network information",
  "analysis": "The code uses socket library functions to obtain hostname and IP address. It creates a UDP socket to connect to a public DNS server to determine the local IP address, with fallback to localhost if no connection is possible. No hardcoded credentials, no data exfiltration, and no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and uses standard methods to obtain network information without malicious intent or security risks.",
