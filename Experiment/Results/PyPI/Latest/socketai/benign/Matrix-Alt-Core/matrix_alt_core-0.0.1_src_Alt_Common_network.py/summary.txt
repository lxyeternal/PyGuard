  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for obtaining device hostname and IP address, with no malicious intent or security issues. The minor security risk score of 0.1 assigned in some reports is justified due to external DNS contact but does not indicate any threat. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."
