{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves the hostname and local IP address of the device for potential network identification purposes.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname() and socket.socket().connect() to external server (8.8.8.8).",
  "fires": "No evident untrusted data sinks that leak data externally or manipulate system in malicious ways.",
  "flows": "Hostname obtained from gethostname() is stored; local IP address obtained via socket connection to external DNS server. No flow of untrusted data to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of socket to determine local IP is standard; fallback to localhost is safe.",
  "analysis": "The code uses socket library functions to determine the hostname and the local IP address. The hostname is acquired via gethostname(), a common method for system identification. The local IP is determined by creating a UDP socket and connecting to a public DNS server (8.8.8.8), then retrieving the socket's own address. This approach is standard for discovering local network IPs and involves no malicious behavior. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are evident. The code is straightforward and uses common network functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate network identification tasks without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply retrieves device network info for legitimate purposes.",
