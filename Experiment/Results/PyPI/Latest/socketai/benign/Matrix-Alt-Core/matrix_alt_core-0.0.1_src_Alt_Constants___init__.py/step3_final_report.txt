  "purpose": "The code imports 'Field' and 'TEAM' from local modules, serving as dependencies for a larger package.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading from sibling modules (.Field and .Teams).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks; purely static imports.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or dynamic execution; static import statements only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements importing 'Field' and 'TEAM' from local modules. There is no dynamic behavior, data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which are appropriate given the simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module import with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
