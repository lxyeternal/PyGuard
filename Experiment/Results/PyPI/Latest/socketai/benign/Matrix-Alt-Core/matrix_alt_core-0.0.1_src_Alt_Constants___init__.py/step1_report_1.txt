{
  "purpose": "Importing classes or variables from relative modules within a package, likely for use in the current module.",
  "sources": "Imports from .Field and .Teams modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs observed",
  "flows": "None, as this code only performs import statements",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements: one importing the 'Field' class or object from the '.Field' module, and the other importing 'TEAM' from the '.Teams' module. Both are relative imports indicating modular code organization. There is no execution of untrusted data, no code injection, nor any suspicious or malicious activity. The code appears standard for a Python package's internal structure.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple import statement without any malicious behavior or security issues. It does not perform any data handling, network communication, or other potentially risky operations.",
