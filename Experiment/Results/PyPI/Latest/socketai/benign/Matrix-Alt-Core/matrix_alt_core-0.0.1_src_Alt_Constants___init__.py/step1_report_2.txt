{
  "purpose": "This code imports modules and a constant from a package, likely for further use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.Field and .Teams), potentially loading classes or constants.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted code are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in these import statements; they merely include external code definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears standard for modular imports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two import statements, importing a class 'Field' and a constant 'TEAM' from sibling modules. No data input, external connections, or dynamic code execution is present. These are typical import statements in a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning solely to import components from local modules. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
