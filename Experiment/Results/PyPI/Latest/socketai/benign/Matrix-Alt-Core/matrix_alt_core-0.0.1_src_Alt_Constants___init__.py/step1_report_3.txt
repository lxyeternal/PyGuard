{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a module that imports specific components or constants from other parts of the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module files 'Field' and 'Teams'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses relative imports which is standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements: one importing 'Field' from a local module and another importing 'TEAM' from another local module. There are no dynamic code executions, no input handling, and no data manipulation. This is typical module import syntax and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. Given the simplicity and clarity, there are no signs of obfuscation or malware. The code does not perform any actions beyond importing modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves to import components from other modules within the package. There are no malicious activities or security concerns evident from this snippet.",
