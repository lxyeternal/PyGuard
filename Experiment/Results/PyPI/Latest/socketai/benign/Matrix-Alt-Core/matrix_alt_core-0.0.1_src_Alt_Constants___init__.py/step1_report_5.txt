  "purpose": "The code imports specific components (Field and TEAM) from local modules within a package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.Field and .Teams).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; just module imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements importing classes or constants from sibling modules within the package. There are no functions, variables, or executable code that could indicate malicious behavior. The imports do not access environment variables, external resources, or execute code dynamically. The simplicity of the code minimizes the likelihood of malicious intent. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a basic import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be part of a normal module structure.",
