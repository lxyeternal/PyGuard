{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing specific components (Field and TEAM) from local modules within a package.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.Field' and '.Teams' modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing operations present",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only contains import statements",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only import statements with no additional logic or data handling, which is normal for module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements: one importing 'Field' from a relative module '.Field' and another importing 'TEAM' from a relative module '.Teams'. There are no functions, data processing, or untrusted input handling present. As such, there are no obvious security issues, malicious behavior, or anomalies in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal import code snippet with no malicious activity or security concerns identified. It appears to be a standard module import setup.",
