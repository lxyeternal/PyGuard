  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing typical directory setup and file download operations. The only potential risk is the lack of URL validation, which could be exploited if misused, but this does not constitute malicious behavior. Scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate."
