{
  "purpose": "The code provides various unit conversion functions for length, rotation, and coordinate inversion, primarily for geometric or measurement processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, including numeric values, iterables, and constants from imported modules (Types, Measurements, Field).",
  "sinks": "The functions perform conversions and calculations without writing to external systems, network, or files. No sinks suggest malicious data leakage or effect.",
  "flows": "Input values are passed through conversion functions and internal helpers, with no external or unsafe data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. The use of lambda functions is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of unit conversion functions and coordinate inversion, which call external modules for conversion logic. The internal __convert helper safely applies conversions to single or multiple values, handling errors gracefully. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated constructs, or malicious behaviors are present. The functions operate solely on numeric data, with no external side effects or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard measurement and coordinate transformation module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs straightforward calculations and data conversions, adhering to expected patterns for such utilities.",
