{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for length and rotation unit conversions, coordinate inversion, and length/rotation conversions between different units.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (collections.abc, typing, local modules), uses external constants (Field), and internal conversion functions.",
  "sinks": "The internal __convert function applies conversions to input data; no direct sinks that cause data leakage or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through conversion functions (__convert, convertLength, convertRotation) which apply provided conversion functions to data; no external data sinks are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Conversion functions are standard, with straightforward implementation. No dynamic code execution or external network calls observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard measurement conversion functions with safe, straightforward logic. It uses a helper __convert to handle both single values and iterables securely, with exception handling for ValueError. Inversion functions rely on Field constants, which are presumably safe. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected; all functions perform expected unit conversions or coordinate manipulations. There is no data leakage, external data transfer, or malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for unit conversions and coordinate transformations, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe and well-structured.",
