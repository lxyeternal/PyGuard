  "purpose": "Utility functions for unit conversions, coordinate inversion, and length/rotation transformations in spatial computations.",
  "sources": "Function arguments, external modules (Measurements, Types, Field) for constants and conversion functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or file I/O; primarily internal calculations.",
  "flows": "Input values are processed through arithmetic or external conversion functions, with exception handling for ValueError.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides measurement and coordinate transformation utilities with safe arithmetic and external module reliance. Exception handling is limited but appropriate. No external threats or malicious behaviors are evident. External modules' safety is assumed but should be verified separately.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for spatial and measurement conversions. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, low security risk 0.1-0.2) are justified and appropriate.",
