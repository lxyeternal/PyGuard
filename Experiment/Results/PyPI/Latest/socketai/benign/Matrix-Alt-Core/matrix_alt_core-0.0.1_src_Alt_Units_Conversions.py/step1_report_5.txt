{
  "purpose": "Provide unit conversion functions for length, rotation, and coordinate inversion, primarily for spatial calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads constants from Field.fieldHeight and Field.fieldWidth; uses inputs to conversion functions (__convert), which can take numeric values or iterables.",
  "sinks": "Uses conversion functions from Measurements.Length and Measurements.Rotation that process input values; no direct sinks for untrusted data outside these functions.",
  "flows": "Input values are passed into conversion functions (__convert), which apply safe mathematical conversions or delegated measurement conversions; no external or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Conversion functions use try-except for ValueError but do not perform any unsafe operations or data exfiltration. The code relies on external modules (Measurements, Field) whose security is unknown, but within this code, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions for unit conversions and coordinate transformations. It reads data from input parameters and external modules (Measurements, Field). The conversion process involves calling external measurement conversion methods that are presumed to be safe. The __convert helper function safely applies conversions with exception handling. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears well-structured, focused on mathematical conversions, with no suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility module for unit conversions and coordinate transformations. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The external measurement functions should be reviewed separately for safety, but within this code, there are no signs of malware or security issues.",
