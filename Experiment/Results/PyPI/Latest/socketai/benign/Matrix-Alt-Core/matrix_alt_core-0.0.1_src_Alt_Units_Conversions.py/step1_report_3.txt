{
  "purpose": "Provide various unit conversions between length and rotation units, and coordinate transformations including inversion relative to field dimensions.",
  "sources": "Reads include function parameters accepting numeric values or iterables, and imports from collections, typing, and local modules.",
  "sinks": "Conversion functions and methods process data; no data is sent to external sources or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "Input values flow through conversion functions (__convert, convertLength, convertRotation), with safe handling and exception management.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. Conversion logic is straightforward. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit conversions with helper functions, safe iterable handling, and coordinate inversion relative to field dimensions. Uses local modules for measurement conversions, with exception handling for ValueError. No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for unit conversions and coordinate adjustments with no malicious intent. It functions as expected for its purpose, with no security risks detected.",
