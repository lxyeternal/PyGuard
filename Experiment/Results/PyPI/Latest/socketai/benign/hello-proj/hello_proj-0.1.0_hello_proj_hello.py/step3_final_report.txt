  "sources": "Dynamic imports, eval/exec usage, potential obfuscation patterns, input data handling.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (dynamic imports, eval/exec) leading to potential malicious actions (network, file, environment).",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, complex dynamic imports, obfuscation indicators, inconsistent code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which can be exploited maliciously. No explicit malicious activity is confirmed, but patterns like eval/exec and complex imports increase suspicion. The code's benign appearance and lack of hardcoded secrets reduce the malware likelihood. The obfuscation and dynamic features suggest moderate risk, warranting a malware score around 0.4. The security risk is also moderate due to potential for hidden malicious behavior. Confidence in these assessments is 0.6, given the absence of concrete malicious code snippets.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic import patterns, raising moderate suspicion but no confirmed malicious activity. Slightly increased malware score (0.4) is justified, with a moderate security risk (0.4). Overall, the code warrants cautious review but is not definitively malicious.",
