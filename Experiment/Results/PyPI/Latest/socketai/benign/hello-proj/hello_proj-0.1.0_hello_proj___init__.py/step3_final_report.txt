  "purpose": "A minimal Python script defining a main function that prints 'Hello, World!'.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data sources, or environment variables used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only outputs static text to the console.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code executes a simple print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, benign script with no external dependencies, no data processing, and no network activity. It defines a main function that prints a static message. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with no malicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The provided reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to the scores or conclusions are necessary.",
