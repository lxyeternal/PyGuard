  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the function only outputs a fixed string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual language features, and no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward, minimal Python script with a main function that outputs a fixed message. There are no data sources, no external inputs, no dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior detected. The code does not contain any malicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and intended for basic output. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
