  "purpose": "Load configuration defaults and dynamically load patch files from the 'tutorwebhooks/patches' directory into hooks filters.",
  "sources": "Reading patch files from the filesystem in 'tutorwebhooks/patches' directory.",
  "sinks": "Adding patch content to 'hooks.Filters.ENV_PATCHES', which could influence hook behavior if patches are malicious.",
  "flows": "Filesystem reads patch files -> reads content -> adds to hooks.Filters.ENV_PATCHES.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; straightforward patch loading pattern. No validation of patch contents.",
  "analysis": "The code sets default configuration values, then iterates over files in a specific directory, reading each file's content and storing it in a hooks filter. It does not execute or evaluate the content, only loads it. No user input, network activity, or code execution occurs here. The only potential risk is if the filesystem or patches are compromised, but the code itself is benign. The scores reflect this: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, low security risk (~0.2) due to external file dependency, assuming filesystem security. The code is standard for plugin patch management, with no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign plugin patch loader with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The low security risk score is justified assuming proper filesystem permissions. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall assessment is consistent with the reports.",
