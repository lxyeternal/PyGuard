{
  "purpose": "The code configures hooks and patches for a tutorwebhooks plugin, setting default configurations and loading patch files from a directory.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from __about__, reading patch files from the filesystem via glob and open.",
  "sinks": "Adding items to hooks.Filters.CONFIG_DEFAULTS and hooks.Filters.ENV_PATCHES, which are then used elsewhere in the application.",
  "flows": "Version info and plugin version are added to defaults; patch files are read and added to environment patches for later application.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network activity observed. The code dynamically reads patch files which is a standard pattern for plugin patching.",
  "analysis": "The code sets default configuration parameters for a plugin and loads patch files dynamically from a specific directory. It uses standard library functions (glob, open) and reads files in text mode with utf-8 encoding. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The reading of files and adding to hooks is a common extension pattern for plugins. The code appears to be benign, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard plugin configuration code, loading patch files for later application, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It appears safe and aligns with typical plugin setup patterns.",
