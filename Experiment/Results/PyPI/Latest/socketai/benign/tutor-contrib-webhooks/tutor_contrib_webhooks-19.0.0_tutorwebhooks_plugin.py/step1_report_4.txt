{
  "purpose": "The code initializes configuration defaults for a plugin system, applies patches from files in a specific directory, and sets version-related variables.",
  "sources": "Reads version information (__version__), reads patch files from the filesystem using glob, opens patch files with open().",
  "sinks": "None identified that directly lead to data leaks or malicious effects; files are read but not executed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> Adds config items -> Loads patch files from directory -> Reads patch files into memory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code. Uses standard library functions appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The script sets default configuration values and loads patch files from a specific directory within the package. It uses standard library functions for file handling and directory globbing. No user input, untrusted data, or network activity is present. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard plugin configuration and patch loading routine with no malicious intent or security risks. It operates within expected parameters for such setup scripts.",
