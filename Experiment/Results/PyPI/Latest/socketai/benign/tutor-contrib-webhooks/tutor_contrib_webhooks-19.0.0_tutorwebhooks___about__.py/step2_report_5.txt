  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or data flow.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n\n3. **Scores review:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` score = 0, which is appropriate.\n   - `obfuscated` scores are 0, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n   - `securityRisk` scores are 0, aligning with the benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a static version string assignment with no suspicious activity, a risk score > 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - All reports correctly assign a risk of 0.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or present.\n   - The malware score remains at 0, which is correct.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they recognize the code's simplicity.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional comments:\nGiven the code's simplicity, there is no reason to adjust the scores. The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, standard version declaration, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores reflect this accurately.",
