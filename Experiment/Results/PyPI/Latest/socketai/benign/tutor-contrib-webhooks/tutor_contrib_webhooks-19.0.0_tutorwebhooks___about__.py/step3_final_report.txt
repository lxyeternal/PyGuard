  "purpose": "Define the package version string for Python package management.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string \"19.0.0\" to the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is a straightforward version string assignment with no suspicious or unusual elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string to __version__, a common pattern in Python packages. No dynamic code, input/output, external dependencies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a standard version declaration. There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The provided reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
