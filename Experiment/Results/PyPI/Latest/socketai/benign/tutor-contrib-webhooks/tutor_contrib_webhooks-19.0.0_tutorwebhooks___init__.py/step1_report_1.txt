  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for performing data processing or system interaction tasks, but the specific purpose cannot be fully determined due to lack of context and code content.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, user inputs, or external data sources such as files or network connections.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, network destinations, or outputs, and may execute commands or functions with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input/env variables) through processing functions to sinks (outputs, commands, network).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies; however, without specific code snippets, subtle issues such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious network connections cannot be ruled out.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review cannot be completed due to missing code content. No suspicious patterns like hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious function calls are explicitly evident. The code's structure and logic need to be evaluated to identify potential malicious behavior, but insufficient details prevent definitive conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information, there are no clear indications of malicious behavior. However, the lack of specific code content limits confidence. The code should be reviewed further with complete context to rule out hidden risks.",
