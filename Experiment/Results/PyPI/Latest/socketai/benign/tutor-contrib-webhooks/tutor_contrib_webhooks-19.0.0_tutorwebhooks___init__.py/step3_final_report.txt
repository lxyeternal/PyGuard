  "purpose": "Analyze the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency, focusing on malicious behavior, anomalies, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Data inputs such as user inputs, environment variables, network calls, file operations, and dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, file writes, or system modifications that could lead to security breaches.",
  "flows": "Source points to sinks through code execution paths, data processing routines, or network interactions, indicating potential malicious data leaks or system compromise.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code constructs, complex obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious network domains.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks explicit malicious patterns, with no suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. Obfuscation levels are minimal, and complex constructs are typical of utility code rather than malicious intent. Confidence scores are high where detailed review exists, and malware scores are zero across all reports. The security risk scores are conservatively set at 0.2, reflecting cautious assessment but no evident threats. Overall, the code appears benign, with no signs of sabotage or supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code is primarily utility or data processing, with minimal obfuscation and no suspicious activity. The security risk is low, and the supply chain integrity appears intact.",
