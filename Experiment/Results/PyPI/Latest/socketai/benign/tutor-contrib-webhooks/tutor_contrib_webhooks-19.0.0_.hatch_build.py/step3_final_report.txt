  "purpose": "Dynamically loads package version information by executing the contents of '__about__.py' to extract the '__version__' variable.",
  "sources": "Reads the file '__about__.py' in the 'tutorwebhooks' directory and executes its content via 'exec()'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'exec()' on external code, which can run arbitrary and potentially malicious code if the file is compromised.",
  "flows": "Reads the file '__about__.py' -> executes its content with 'exec()' -> accesses '__version__' variable -> updates 'metadata' dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec()' on an external file without validation or sanitization, which can execute malicious code if the file is tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a Python file and executes its entire content using 'exec()', which is inherently risky because it can run malicious code if the file is compromised. This pattern is a common security concern in supply chain contexts. The code's purpose is straightforward, but the method introduces a significant security risk. The reports correctly identify the use of 'exec()' as a vulnerability, with scores reflecting the potential for malicious activity. Malware scores should be higher (around 0.7) given the potential for executing malicious payloads, especially if the file can be altered by an attacker. Security risk scores are justified at approximately 0.75, considering the danger of executing untrusted code. The approach should be replaced with safer alternatives, such as importing the module or reading specific variables without executing code.",
  "conclusion": "The code's reliance on 'exec()' to load version information poses a significant security risk, as it can execute malicious code if the file is compromised. The reports correctly identify this issue, and the assigned scores are appropriate, though malware scores could be slightly increased to reflect the high potential for malicious code execution. Overall, this pattern should be replaced with safer methods to mitigate supply chain risks.",
