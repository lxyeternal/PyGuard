  "conclusion": "The code's reliance on 'exec()' to load version information poses a significant security risk, as it can execute malicious code if the file is compromised. The reports correctly identify this issue, and the assigned scores are appropriate, though malware scores could be slightly increased to reflect the high potential for malicious code execution. Overall, this pattern should be replaced with safer methods to mitigate supply chain risks."
