  "conclusion": "The code exhibits features typical of potentially malicious or backdoored scripts, mainly due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution. While no direct malicious payloads are confirmed, the patterns warrant a high security concern. Scores should reflect moderate to high suspicion, emphasizing obfuscation and code execution risks."
