{
  "purpose": "The code monitors Bitcoin wallet balances and transactions by querying blockchain.info for specified wallet addresses, logging changes and transactions, and alerting via sound notifications.",
  "sources": "Data is read from user-provided wallet dictionaries (addresses, balance, last_timestamp), environment variables are not used, and network data is fetched via requests.get().",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing logs to a file, printing to console, and playing sound files. Network requests are made to external API 'https://blockchain.info/rawaddr/'.",
  "flows": "Wallet addresses are sourced from the 'wallets' list; data fetched via requests.get; responses parsed; balance and transaction data are processed; updates are logged and sound notifications triggered.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or secrets. The use of 'winsound' for playing sounds is typical but not suspicious. The function 'requester' fetches data similarly to main logic but is unused, which may indicate incomplete or redundant code. The code structure is straightforward without obfuscation. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
  "analysis": "The script continuously monitors a list of wallets by polling blockchain.info API every 60 seconds. It processes transaction data, detects balance changes, and logs details. It also plays a sound upon detecting new transactions. The code uses standard libraries and functions. No attempts to exfiltrate data, connect to suspicious domains, or perform malicious actions are present. The only minor concern is the unused 'requester' function, which does not impact security. Overall, the code appears legitimate and intended for wallet monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs wallet monitoring with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It employs standard practices and libraries for data retrieval, processing, and logging. There are no security risks or malware indicators.",
