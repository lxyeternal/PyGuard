{
  "purpose": "Monitor specified Bitcoin wallets for balance changes and new transactions, logging events and alerting via sound.",
  "sources": "Reads wallet data from the blockchain.info API, reads wallet list and parameters from input variables, reads system time for timestamp comparisons.",
  "sinks": "Outputs logs to a file, prints alerts to console, plays sound files upon new transactions.",
  "flows": "Fetches wallet data from API (source), processes transaction data and balance updates, logs and alerts (sink), with flow from API response to logging and sound alert.",
  "anomalies": "Re-initialization of 'processed_transactions' each loop prevents persistent duplicate detection; missing imports ('time', 'datetime'); undefined variables ('GREEN', 'RED', 'ENDC'); unused 'requester' function; hardcoded sound filename; no input validation or rate limiting.",
  "analysis": "The code performs wallet monitoring by polling an external API, logging balance and transaction changes, and playing sounds on new transactions. It does not contain malicious code or backdoors. The main issues are operational: re-initializing the 'processed_transactions' set each cycle reduces effectiveness, missing imports cause runtime errors, and undefined variables suggest incomplete code. These flaws do not indicate malicious intent but could lead to missed transactions or resource inefficiencies. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and benign, with minor implementation flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign wallet monitoring script with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The minor implementation issues are operational rather than security concerns. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.3 due to operational flaws that could affect robustness but do not pose security threats.",
