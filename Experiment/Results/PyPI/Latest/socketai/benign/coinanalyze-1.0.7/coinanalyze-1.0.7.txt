The overall security risk score is 0.3 due to this potential, but no active malicious behavior is detected."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The critical security issue is the use of 'exec()' on data from 'detect_address', which could execute malicious code if the source is untrusted. This pattern introduces a high risk of remote code execution. The overall malware score should be set high (around 0.75), and the security risk similarly elevated, unless the output of 'detect_address' is guaranteed safe. The rest of the code appears standard and benign."

The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.3 due to operational flaws that could affect robustness but do not pose security threats."

While no direct malicious payloads are confirmed, the patterns warrant a high security concern. Scores should reflect moderate to high suspicion, emphasizing obfuscation and code execution risks."

The only minor security concern is lack of input sanitization, which does not constitute malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with malware scores of 0 and obfuscation scores of 0. The slight security risk score (~0.1) is justified due to potential misuse with malicious data, but this does not reflect actual malicious intent."
