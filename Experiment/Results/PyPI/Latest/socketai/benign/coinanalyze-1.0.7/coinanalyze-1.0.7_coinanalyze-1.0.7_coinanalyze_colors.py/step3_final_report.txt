  "purpose": "Detects the operating system to configure terminal color output appropriately, enabling ANSI escape sequences on supported Windows versions.",
  "sources": "sys.platform, platform.platform(), platform.version()",
  "sinks": "os.system('')",
  "flows": "platform.version().split('.') -> check version number -> os.system('') if conditions met",
  "anomalies": "Assumes platform.version() has at least three segments; potential IndexError if format differs",
  "analysis": "The code detects OS type and version to determine whether to enable colored terminal output. It disables colors on macOS, Windows, and iOS by default, but enables ANSI sequences on Windows 10 versions >= 10586 using os.system(''). The color variables are set accordingly. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present; the code is straightforward. The only concern is the assumption about platform.version() format, which could cause runtime errors if the version string is shorter than expected. No vulnerabilities or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, primarily for environment detection and color setup. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The only minor issue is the potential for runtime errors due to version string parsing assumptions. Overall, the code is safe with low security risk.",
