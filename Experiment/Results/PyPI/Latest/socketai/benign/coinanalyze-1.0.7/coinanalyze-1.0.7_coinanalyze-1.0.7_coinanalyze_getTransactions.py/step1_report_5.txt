{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for blockchain transaction data retrieval, database transaction management, and mocking database connections for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from external APIs (e.g., mempool.space), blockchain node connections, and database connections.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data is written to files ('latest_transactions.txt') and possibly stored in a database. External API responses are processed but not executed as code.",
  "flows": "API responses are fetched and stored; database sessions are created and managed for testing; blockchain data is retrieved and stored; external data is processed for transaction analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures observed. The code uses external libraries for blockchain interaction and database management without suspicious modifications. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles data retrieval from blockchain and external APIs, data storage, and mocking for testing purposes. It does not execute untrusted code or perform network operations beyond API requests. No signs of malicious behavior such as data theft, backdoors, or hidden payloads. The functions include standard practices for database transaction safety and test isolation. The use of external modules and API calls appears legitimate. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for blockchain data analysis and testing. No evidence of malicious intent, supply chain sabotage, or malware is found. The code is well-structured for its purpose with no suspicious behavior.",
