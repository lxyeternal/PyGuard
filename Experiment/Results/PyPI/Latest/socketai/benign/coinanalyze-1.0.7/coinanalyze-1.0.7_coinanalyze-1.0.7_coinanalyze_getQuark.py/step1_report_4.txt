  "purpose": "To check for the presence of 'quark.html' and, if not found, clone a GitHub repository to install Quark for graph visualization.",
  "sources": "os.listdir(), os.getcwd(), os.system(), os.remove(), shutil.rmtree()",
  "sinks": "os.system() commands executing 'git clone', 'mv', and 'rm' operations, which modify the filesystem and download external content",
  "flows": "Checks local directory for 'quark.html' -> if absent, executes system commands to clone repository -> moves files -> deletes repository directory",
  "anomalies": "Uses os.system() to run shell commands involving network operations and filesystem modifications; no validation of input; direct execution of 'git clone' without verification",
  "analysis": "The code checks if 'quark.html' exists in the current directory. If not, it clones a GitHub repository containing Quark, moves specific files to the current directory, removes the repository folder, and informs the user. The use of os.system() for cloning and file operations introduces security concerns, such as potential command injection if variables were untrusted (though they are hardcoded here). The repository is trusted, but executing external commands dynamically is generally risky. No hardcoded credentials or hidden backdoors are evident. The code's primary function is to automate setup of a visualization tool, with no malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script automates the download and setup of an external visualization tool. While it involves system commands that could be exploited if parameters were untrusted, in this context, it performs standard operations without malicious intent. No malware signals detected.",
