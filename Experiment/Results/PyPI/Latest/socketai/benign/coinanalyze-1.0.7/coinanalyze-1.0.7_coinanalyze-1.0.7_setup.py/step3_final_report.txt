  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata and dependencies for the 'coinanalyze' Python package using setuptools. It is a static setup script with no dynamic behavior.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including package name, version, description, author, license, install_requires, and extras_require.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data, nor does it perform any runtime actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is static configuration without data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "The 'license' field is set to 'Python Script', which is unconventional and not a recognized license identifier, but this is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard static setup script with no dynamic code, external input, or obfuscation. The only unusual aspect is the license string, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores set to 0. The confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment. No suspicious patterns, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package configuration script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The only minor anomaly is the license string, which does not pose a security threat. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
