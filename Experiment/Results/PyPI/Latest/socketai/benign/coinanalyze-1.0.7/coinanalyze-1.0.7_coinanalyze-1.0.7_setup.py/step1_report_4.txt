{
  "purpose": "This code is used to define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'coinanalyze', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package metadata (name, version, description, author, license), and specifies dependencies in 'install_requires' and 'extras_require'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or execution are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the setup script simply provides configuration data for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "The 'license' field is set to 'Python Script', which is unusual and not a standard license identifier; no other anomalies are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to configure package metadata and dependencies. All data are hardcoded string literals. There are no input or output operations, no code execution based on external input, and no dynamic or obfuscated code present. The dependencies specified are standard and benign. The license field's value is atypical but not malicious. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are evident in this configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a standard package configuration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The only minor concern is the unusual license string, but it does not impact security. Overall, the code is benign.",
