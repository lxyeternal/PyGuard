{
  "purpose": "This script defines the setup configuration for the Python package 'coinanalyze', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package name, version, description, author, license, and dependencies defined as string literals.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or data from external sources.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only sets static configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code constructs are present. The license field is labeled as 'Python Script', which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls the 'setup()' function with static parameters to configure packaging. All values are hardcoded literals, and there are no input streams or external data reads. Dependencies are explicitly listed with standard syntax. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It only contains static configuration data and does not perform any dangerous operations.",
