  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'coinanalyze', including metadata, dependencies, and additional requirements.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call and its parameters, including package details, dependencies, and author information.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the parameters provided in setup() into the packaging process; no external untrusted data input observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns. The license field is set to 'Python Script', which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to configure package installation. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and optional development dependencies. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The dependencies appear standard, and no input or output operations are involved. The license field being set to 'Python Script' is unconventional but not malicious. Overall, this appears to be a straightforward package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign configuration for distributing a Python package.",
