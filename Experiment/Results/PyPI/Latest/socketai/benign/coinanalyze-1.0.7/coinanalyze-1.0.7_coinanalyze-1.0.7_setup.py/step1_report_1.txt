  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'coinanalyze'.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters including package name, version, description, author, license, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "N/A (no untrusted data input/output points in this code).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks).",
  "anomalies": "The license is specified as 'Python Script', which is unusual and potentially suspicious since it's not a recognized open-source license. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools. It specifies package metadata and dependencies. No code execution or external data handling occurs, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The only unusual aspect is the 'license' field value, which is not a valid license identifier and may indicate a misconfiguration or attempt to obscure licensing details.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a typical package setup configuration with no malicious intent. The only noteworthy point is the unconventional license description. No malicious or security risks are evident.",
