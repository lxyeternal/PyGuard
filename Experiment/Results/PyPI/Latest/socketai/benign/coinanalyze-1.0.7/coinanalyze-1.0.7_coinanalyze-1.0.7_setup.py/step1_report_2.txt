{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the Python package 'coinanalyze' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata and dependencies from the script itself; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data are present; the code simply specifies package info and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; dependency specifications are static.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The license is set as 'Python Script', which is unusual but not malicious. No obfuscated or dynamic code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration using setuptools. It specifies package name, version, description, author, license, required dependencies, and extras. All data is static, hardcoded, and typical for a setup script. No external inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution are observed. The dependencies listed are benign, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup configuration with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a normal package setup script.",
