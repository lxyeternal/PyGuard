  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for data format conversion with negligible malicious potential. The only minor security concern is lack of input sanitization, which does not constitute malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with malware scores of 0 and obfuscation scores of 0. The slight security risk score (~0.1) is justified due to potential misuse with malicious data, but this does not reflect actual malicious intent."
