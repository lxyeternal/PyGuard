    "Use of external API without validation or sanitization of the response data",
    "No validation or sanitization of API response before writing to file"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code imports a module with 'from utils import *', which can import arbitrary code; this may be risky but is not inherently malicious. The critical point is the execution of 'exec(rdata2)', which runs code from an external file 'test_address_list2.txt' without validation, representing a high risk of executing malicious code if the file is compromised. The function 'fetch_latest_transactions' fetches JSON data from an external API and writes it directly to a file, which could be exploited if the API returns malicious payloads, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious. There are no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Overall, the main concern is the dynamic execution of external code, which could be malicious if the input file is tampered with.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a high risk due to the execution of external code via exec(rdata2), which could execute malicious code if the input file is compromised. Otherwise, the API interaction and database functions are standard and do not contain malicious behavior. The overall security risk is elevated mainly because of the use of exec on external input.",
