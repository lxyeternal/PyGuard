  "conclusion": "The critical security issue is the use of 'exec()' on data from 'detect_address', which could execute malicious code if the source is untrusted. This pattern introduces a high risk of remote code execution. The overall malware score should be set high (around 0.75), and the security risk similarly elevated, unless the output of 'detect_address' is guaranteed safe. The rest of the code appears standard and benign."
