  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependencies for malicious behavior, supply chain risks, and security issues, focusing on code patterns such as eval(), exec(), obfuscation, and dynamic imports.",
  "sources": "Input functions (e.g., input(), environment variables), file/network operations, dynamic imports, eval()/exec() calls, environment variables, system commands.",
  "sinks": "Execution functions (eval(), exec(), os.system()), network connections, file writes, environment variables, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources (inputs, environment variables) into eval()/exec() or system calls, potentially leading to data leaks, code execution, or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() with untrusted data, obfuscation, dynamic imports, complex control flow, hardcoded secrets, unusual variable naming, or code complexity.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate varying levels of dynamic code usage, obfuscation, and complexity. Reports 1 and 2 show cautious use of eval()/exec() with controlled inputs, resulting in low malware and risk scores. Report 3 exhibits obfuscation and dynamic imports, justifying higher suspicion and scores. Reports 4 and 5 are straightforward, with no suspicious patterns. The scores align with the described code behaviors, and no evidence of malicious payloads is present. The overall assessment suggests minimal malware risk, with some obfuscation and dynamic features warranting moderate caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits no confirmed malicious activity. Dynamic code execution and obfuscation are present but do not definitively indicate malicious intent. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Continued monitoring of dynamic import points and obfuscation patterns is recommended, but current assessments are justified.",
