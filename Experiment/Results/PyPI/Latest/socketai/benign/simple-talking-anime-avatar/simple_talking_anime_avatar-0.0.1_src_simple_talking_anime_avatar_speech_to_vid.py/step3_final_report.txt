  "purpose": "The code transcribes audio using Whisper, then generates lip-synced video frames based on the transcription, creating a visual avatar synchronized with speech.",
  "sources": "Audio file input (audio_file_name), transcription data from whisper, external get_image_speaking() function generating frames.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is written to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Audio loaded from file -> transcribed to text -> text parsed into words with timestamps -> get_image_speaking() called with current letter -> frames written to video output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. The print(data) statement could leak transcription info but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard speech-to-video lip-sync generation using open-source libraries. No network activity, credential handling, or malicious logic is present. External dependencies are typical for such applications. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The transcription data is used solely for visual synchronization. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign analysis. No logical flaws or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign multimedia processing script for lip-sync avatar generation. It shows no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and justified.",
