  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the installation or importation of external modules, possibly related to package management or environment setup.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, importing modules, reading configuration files or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Executing system commands, writing to files, network communications, or logging activities.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or user input flows into command execution or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials or tokens, use of eval or exec with untrusted data, obfuscated or complex code to hide behavior, unusual dynamic imports, or network connections to suspicious domains.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple modules, some of which are standard, while others may be custom or obscure. No clear data sources are evident initially, but the presence of environment variable reads and dynamic imports suggests potential input sources. Potential sinks include system commands or network calls. The code structure must be examined thoroughly to identify if data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, which could indicate malicious activity. No obvious hardcoded secrets are detected, but any use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution should be scrutinized. The code complexity and structure do not clearly indicate obfuscation, but if code is dynamically generated or includes unclear modules, suspicion increases.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the initial analysis, no definitive malicious behavior is identified; however, the use of environment variables, dynamic imports, or system commands warrants careful review. No overt malware signals such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or cryptomining are detected. The code appears to be standard setup or utility code with potential security concerns if certain patterns are present.",
