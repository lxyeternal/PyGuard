      "conclusion": "The reports' assessments are appropriate and cautious, aligning with observed patterns. Slightly elevated scores in some cases reflect the potential for misuse inherent in environment variables and dynamic code, but no confirmed malicious payloads are present. Continued monitoring and further detailed analysis are recommended for suspicious patterns, especially in Report 1."

It relies on local files and performs standard image processing operations. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1)."
