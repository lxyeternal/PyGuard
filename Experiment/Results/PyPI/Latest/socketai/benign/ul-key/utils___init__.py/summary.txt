  "conclusion": "Overall, the code appears benign with no confirmed malicious activity. The suspicion in report 2 is noted but not substantiated by concrete evidence. The scores are generally appropriate; a minor adjustment to report 2's malware score from 0.4 to 0.3 would improve accuracy. No significant security threats are identified, and the code is considered safe for use."
