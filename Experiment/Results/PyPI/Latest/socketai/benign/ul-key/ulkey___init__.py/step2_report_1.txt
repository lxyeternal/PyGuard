  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the issues are present, whether the reasoning is sound, and if the scores are appropriate.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules (.core and .run).\n- No data processing, external communication, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are claimed or evident.\n- The code is minimal and appears to be part of a larger, modular application.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Findings:** Benign import statements, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Findings:** Similar benign import statements, minimal security concern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated securityRisk score (0.1) may reflect cautiousness, but given no evidence, it's acceptable. Malware=0 is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Findings:** Again, just import statements with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Findings:** Same as others; no issues detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.8.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Justification:**\n- **Malware score:** All zero, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low or zero, matching the minimal security concern based on the code snippet.\n- **Confidence levels:** Slightly varied but generally high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Estimation:**\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the provided scores. The code snippets are benign, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 for very cautious risk, but 0 is justified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate based on the provided code snippets.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The risk scores are reasonable, and the confidence levels are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
