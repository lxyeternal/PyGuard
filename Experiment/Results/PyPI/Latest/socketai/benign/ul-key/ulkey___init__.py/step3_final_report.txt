  "purpose": "Import specific classes and functions from local modules (.core and .run) for use within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the current package modules (.core and .run).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only imports modules without executing or handling data.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules into the namespace; no data flow or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and standard for modular Python projects.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, indicating a modular design. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The modules imported suggest data encoding/decoding or cryptographic functions, but their presence alone is not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or data leaks are present. The code's simplicity and lack of side effects imply a benign purpose. Given the absence of malicious indicators, the overall security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The import statements are standard and do not pose any threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0, and the security risk score should be 0, reflecting the safe nature of this code snippet.",
