{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import specific functions and classes from local modules, likely for use within a larger package or application.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.core' and '.run' modules; these are local module references within the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling or external communication is visible.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow is evident; the code only performs imports without executing or processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports components from other modules within the package. There are no visible operations, data processing, or external interactions. It does not contain any obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security risks. Given its simplicity, it likely serves as a part of a larger module, providing access to the imported functions and classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security concerns in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as an import statement for package modularization. It shows no malicious intent or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
