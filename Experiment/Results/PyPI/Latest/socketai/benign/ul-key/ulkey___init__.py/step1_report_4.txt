{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules, likely related to encoding and decoding data, possibly for cryptographic or data processing purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '.core' and '.run', which could contain input handling or sensitive data processing logic.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as data transmission, system modification, or external calls in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Potential data flow from imported modules (ULKey, encode_ul, decode_ul) to any subsequent code that uses these functions or classes, but not visible here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal with only import statements; no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from local modules, suggesting modular design. It does not perform any operations, data handling, or external interactions. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are apparent in these lines. Due to the lack of additional code, confidence in any malicious intent is very low.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is benign, consisting solely of import statements. No malicious activity or security risks are detectable from this fragment alone.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
