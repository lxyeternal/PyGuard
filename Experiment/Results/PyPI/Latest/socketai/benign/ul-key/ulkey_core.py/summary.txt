  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, reversible obfuscation utility relying on seed-based pseudo-random XOR. No signs of malicious activity or malware are evident. The primary concern is the external mutate_seed function, which could be malicious if implemented poorly, but this cannot be determined from the code alone. Overall, the code is safe, with low security risk, and the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate."
