  "purpose": "The code implements a custom encoding and decoding scheme for strings, using seeded pseudo-random noise XORed with character values, with optional dynamic seed mutation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: seed, text to encode/decode, and blocks from encoded string.",
  "sinks": "None directly apparent; no data leaks, network connections, or system modifications present.",
  "flows": "Input seed is hashed to initialize RNG; characters are XORed with RNG-generated noise during encoding and decoding; seed mutation occurs if mode is 'dynamic'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of XOR with pseudo-random noise is predictable if RNG seed is known; seed mutation depends on external function 'mutate_seed' whose implementation is unknown, potentially leading to predictable or exploitable behavior; no encryption or security validation is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a deterministic RNG based on a SHA-256 hash of the seed. It encodes characters by XORing with random numbers generated from this RNG. During 'dynamic' mode, seed mutation is applied after each character, affecting subsequent RNG state. The decode process mirrors encode, with seed resetting and re-initialization. The overall design appears intended for obfuscation rather than security. The use of predictable pseudo-random noise for encoding is insecure, but not malicious in itself. No network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration is present. The only concern is reliance on an external 'mutate_seed' function, which could introduce vulnerabilities if malicious or poorly designed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a string obfuscation utility relying on pseudo-random noise XOR, with optional dynamic seed mutation. No malicious behavior or security-critical flaws are evident; it appears to be a benign obfuscation mechanism rather than malware. However, its security strength is minimal, and seed mutation could be exploited if 'mutate_seed' is compromised.",
