{
  "purpose": "This code implements a class for encoding and decoding text using a seed-based pseudo-random number generator, with optional dynamic seed mutation for added variability.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'seed' parameter, input text to encode or decode, and internally from the mutate_seed function imported from utils.utils.",
  "sinks": "Uses the RNG to generate noise for encoding/decoding characters, and potentially from the mutate_seed function if it involves external data or network calls.",
  "flows": "The seed is used to initialize RNG; input text is encoded character-by-character with XOR noise; in 'dynamic' mode, the seed is mutated after each character, affecting subsequent RNG states.",
  "anomalies": "Potential concern: reliance on mutate_seed without visibility into its implementation; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no evident data leaks or malicious commands. The use of XOR with high-range random numbers is typical for encoding, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a deterministic RNG based on a SHA-256 hash of the seed, then uses this RNG to generate noise for encoding characters via XOR. In 'dynamic' mode, the seed mutates after each character, which could be used to obscure data. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious actions are present. The imported mutate_seed function could potentially introduce malicious behavior if it performs unwanted modifications or network operations, but based on this code alone, its implementation is unknown. The code appears to be a custom encoding scheme with configurable seed mutation but does not exhibit malware indicators such as data exfiltration, system modification, or malicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a seed-based encoding scheme with optional dynamic seed mutation, with no apparent malicious behavior or supply chain security issues based on the provided fragment. The main concern is the unknown behavior of mutate_seed, but there is no evidence of malicious intent within this code snippet.",
