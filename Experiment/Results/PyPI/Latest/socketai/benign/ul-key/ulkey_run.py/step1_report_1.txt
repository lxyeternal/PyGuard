{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to encode and decode text using the ULKey class from the ulkey.core module, likely for encryption or obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'text', 'encoded_text', 'seed', 'mode' for encoding/decoding functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements output encoded or decoded text; no data is sent externally or over network within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('text', 'encoded_text', 'seed', 'mode') are used to instantiate ULKey objects, which then perform encode/decode operations and return results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures observed. Usage of a third-party class ULKey could be normal or malicious depending on its implementation, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly wraps ULKey's encode and decode methods with simple functions. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious logic. No external data is transmitted or manipulated beyond the encode/decode process. Since ULKey is imported from an external module, its internal behavior could be scrutinized further if needed, but based on this code alone, there's no evidence of malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple wrapper around the ULKey class for encoding and decoding text, with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. The functions themselves are straightforward and do not introduce vulnerabilities.",
