{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to encode and decode text using the ULKey class, likely for data obfuscation or encryption within a larger system.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'text', 'encoded_text', 'seed', and 'mode' passed to the functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data could be encoded/decoded; no other sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Input data (text, encoded_text, seed, mode) flows into ULKey constructor, then into encode/decode methods, returning processed data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of an external library (ulkey.core) is noted, but this alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward wrapper functions around the ULKey class for encoding and decoding operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system commands, or obfuscation. The seed and mode parameters are passed directly to ULKey, whose implementation is unknown, so potential risks depend on that class. However, based solely on this snippet, there are no indicators of malicious intent or security issues. The functions serve as simple interfaces for encryption/decryption routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, functioning as a wrapper for ULKey-based encoding/decoding. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident within this fragment.",
