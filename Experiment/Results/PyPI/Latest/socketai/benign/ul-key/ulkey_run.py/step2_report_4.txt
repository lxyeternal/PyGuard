  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple wrappers around the `ULKey` class, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.\n- The primary concern hinges on the behavior of the external `ULKey` class, which is not provided.\n- None of the reports indicate network activity, data exfiltration, or other malicious indicators within this snippet.\n- The scores assigned to malware are all zero, which aligns with the lack of evidence.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1–0.2), consistent with the code's simplicity and reliance on an external library.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n  No. The code itself appears straightforward, with no embedded vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The concern about `ULKey`'s implementation remains, but that cannot be assessed here.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Potential over-reliance on external implementation:**  \n  The reports correctly note that the security depends on `ULKey`. Since its implementation is unknown, the risk assessment cannot be fully conclusive, but the reports appropriately refrain from asserting malicious intent.\n\n- **No misinterpretation of the code's purpose:**  \n  All reports correctly identify the functions as wrappers for encoding/decoding, with no obfuscation or suspicious code.\n\n### Scores review:\n- The `malware` scores are all 0, which is reasonable given the lack of evidence.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are around 0.1–0.2, reflecting low risk, which seems appropriate.\n- The `obfuscated` scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \nNo changes needed; the scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- Since no malicious activity is observed, and the code is a simple wrapper, a `malware` score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The `securityRisk` score is low, reflecting the reliance on an external, unknown implementation, but no direct vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, due to external dependency uncertainty)\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments.** The code appears benign, and the risk is minimal unless the `ULKey` class contains malicious features, which cannot be evaluated here.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward wrapper around an external class.\n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- The main unknown is the security of `ULKey`, but based on this snippet alone, the risk remains low.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain current scores; monitor `ULKey` implementation separately for potential vulnerabilities.",
