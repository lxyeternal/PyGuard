  "purpose": "Wraps the ULKey class to provide encode and decode functionalities for text data.",
  "sources": "Imports ULKey from ulkey.core; uses seed and mode parameters as inputs for ULKey instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Input text and seed flow into ULKey's encode/decode methods; output is the encoded/decoded string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; straightforward wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal wrapper around an external class ULKey, passing parameters directly to its methods. No internal vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The security of the overall system depends on ULKey's implementation, which is external and unexamined. The code itself does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The malware score is 0, as there is no evidence of malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting reliance on an external component whose trustworthiness is unknown.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward wrapper with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the external ULKey class, which cannot be assessed here. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are absent, and the security risk is low but contingent on ULKey's implementation.",
