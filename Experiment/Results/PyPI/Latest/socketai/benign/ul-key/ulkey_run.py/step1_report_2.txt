{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to encode and decode text using the ULKey class from the ulkey.core module, likely for data obfuscation or encryption.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'text', 'encoded_text', 'seed', and 'mode'. These are inputs to the functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions instantiate ULKey objects with the seed and mode, then perform encode/decode operations. No external data sinks are evident; potential concern if ULKey internally performs network operations or unsafe actions.",
  "flows": "Input data ('text', 'encoded_text', 'seed', 'mode') flows into ULKey instantiation, then to encode/decode methods, returning the result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. No unusual behavior, code injection, or data leakage apparent from the snippet. The security of ULKey's implementation is unknown, but this code alone appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple wrapper functions around the ULKey class for encoding and decoding text. Inputs are user-provided parameters, but no suspicious handling or insecure practices are evident. The code relies on an external library 'ulkey.core', which may contain the core logic; however, from this snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or network activity are visible. The functions serve a clear purpose of obfuscation or encryption using ULKey, assuming the library is trustworthy.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no direct signs of malicious intent or security risks. Its security depends on the ULKey implementation, which isn't provided here. There are no anomalies, backdoors, or suspicious activities in this snippet.",
