{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to encode and decode text using the ULKey class, likely for encryption or obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'text', 'encoded_text', 'seed', and 'mode'. These are received as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "The encode and decode methods of the ULKey object, which may process or transform the data.",
  "flows": "Input data ('text' or 'encoded_text', 'seed', 'mode') is used to instantiate ULKey objects, then passed to their encode or decode methods, producing output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are visible. Usage of an external class 'ULKey' could be benign or malicious, but based on this code alone, there's no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports ULKey from a module, then provides wrapper functions for encoding and decoding strings using an instance of ULKey. The functions are straightforward and do not contain any obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious operations. Since ULKey is imported from an external module, its implementation could contain malicious code, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, file manipulation, or data exfiltration. The code appears to serve a simple purpose of data transformation, with no obvious security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple wrapper around an external encryption/encoding class, with no clear signs of malicious activity within this fragment. The security risks depend on the implementation of ULKey, which is external and unknown. Based solely on this code, the risk appears low.",
