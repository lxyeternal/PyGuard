{
  "purpose": "The code searches for files with a specific extension in a given directory and sends them via Telegram bot.",
  "sources": "Reads the extension parameter, search_path argument, and files from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Requests to Telegram API endpoint with files read from the filesystem, and the file content itself.",
  "flows": "search_path and extension input → find_files function collects files → send_file_to_telegram reads files → POST request to Telegram API with file content.",
  "anomalies": "Contains hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, which are sensitive credentials. No input validation or restrictions are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script uses hardcoded credentials for a Telegram bot, which poses a security risk if exposed. The file search is straightforward, using pathlib to find files matching a pattern. The send_file_to_telegram function reads files from the filesystem and uploads them to Telegram. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual behavior beyond the exposure of credentials. The code's purpose appears benign but could be exploited if credentials are leaked, enabling unauthorized file uploads. No data exfiltration or network malicious activity is evident beyond the intended Telegram communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple file search and upload script with hardcoded Telegram credentials, which is a security concern. No malicious intent or malware behavior is detected, but the hardcoded credentials should be protected or removed.",
