  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** The code matches the description; no discrepancies.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Correctly identifies hardcoded credentials as a security risk. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.3 — seems reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malware or malicious activity, just insecure credential storage.\n- **Overall:** The report is accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** Matches the code; no discrepancies.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Correctly notes hardcoded tokens as a security concern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.3 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent; benign file upload utility.\n- **Overall:** Accurate; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** Consistent with code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Correctly points out security risk due to hardcoded credentials.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.3 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; straightforward file uploader.\n- **Overall:** Accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** Matches code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Correctly emphasizes security concern with hardcoded tokens.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.4 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malware; just insecure credential handling.\n- **Overall:** Accurate; no adjustments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** Consistent.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Notes security risk with hardcoded credentials and data transmission.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.6 — slightly higher, reflecting the potential for misuse.\n- **Justification:** While no malware is present, the combination of credential exposure and network transmission of files could be exploited maliciously if credentials are leaked or misused.\n- **Overall:** The securityRisk score of 0.6 seems justified, given the potential for malicious exploitation, even if the current code isn't malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign but insecure due to hardcoded credentials.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The main concern is the security risk from credential exposure and potential misuse.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \nGiven the code's benign nature and lack of malicious activity, **malware score should remain at 0**.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \nNo obfuscation detected; **obfuscated score remains at 0**.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \nConsidering the security implications of hardcoded credentials and network transmission of potentially sensitive files, a **risk score of around 0.5** is appropriate. The existing scores range from 0.3 to 0.6, with the highest (0.6) justified by potential misuse.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n| Metric             | Estimated Score |\n|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware            | **0**           |\n| Obfuscated         | **0**           |\n| Security Risk      | **0.5**         |\n\nThe code itself is not malicious but poses a security risk due to credential hardcoding and data transmission. Proper credential management and security practices should be recommended.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways avoid hardcoding sensitive credentials; instead, use environment variables or secure credential stores. This reduces the risk of credential leakage and potential misuse.",
