{
  "purpose": "The code searches for files with a specific extension in a given directory and sends those files to a Telegram chat via a bot.",
  "sources": "The code reads the TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and CHAT_ID constants, and the files found via the find_files function, as well as the file contents in send_file_to_telegram.",
  "sinks": "The POST request to Telegram's API endpoint, sending files over the network, potentially exposing file contents if misused.",
  "flows": "The find_files function retrieves files from the filesystem; send_file_to_telegram reads a file and transmits it over the network to a Telegram bot API endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "The TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN is hard-coded in plain text, which is a security risk. No input validation is performed, but the code itself is straightforward. No obfuscation or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed to locate files with a specified extension in a directory, then send these files to a Telegram chat using a bot token. The token and chat ID are stored as plain text, which could lead to credential compromise if the code is shared. The file transmission is done via standard requests to Telegram's API; no malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or system modification is evident. The code performs standard filesystem operations and network communication without obfuscation or concealment. The hardcoded credentials represent a security concern, but the overall functionality appears benign and aligned with typical file-sharing or monitoring tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate file search and upload functions without evident malicious intent. The main security concern is the hardcoded Telegram bot token, which should be stored securely. No malware or malicious activity is detected.",
