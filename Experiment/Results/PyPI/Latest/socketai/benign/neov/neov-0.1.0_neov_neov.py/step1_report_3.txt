{
  "purpose": "The code searches for files with a specific extension within a directory and sends them to a Telegram chat using a bot.",
  "sources": "The code reads the file system via Path.rglob() to find files, and reads files in send_file_to_telegram() to upload them.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post() function sends the file data over the network to Telegram's API endpoint.",
  "flows": "find_files() searches the directory for files; send_file_to_telegram() reads each file and transmits it via network request.",
  "anomalies": "The Telegram bot token and chat ID are hardcoded within the script, which is a security concern. No input validation or dynamic data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines constants for Telegram bot credentials. The find_files() function searches for files with a specified extension in a given directory, handling possible OS errors silently. The send_file_to_telegram() function opens each file and uploads it to Telegram using the bot API, which involves network communication. The hardcoded credentials are a security risk, but there are no signs of malicious behavior like data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution. The code functions as a file uploader utility without evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward file search and upload utility that contains hardcoded sensitive credentials, which poses a security risk but does not exhibit malicious behavior. There are no indications of malware or malicious activities beyond insecure credential management.",
