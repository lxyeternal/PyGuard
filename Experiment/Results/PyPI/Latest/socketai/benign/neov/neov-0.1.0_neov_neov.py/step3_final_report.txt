{
  "purpose": "Searches for files with a specific extension in a directory and uploads them to a Telegram chat via a bot using hardcoded credentials.",
  "sources": "File system (search_path), reading files for upload",
  "sinks": "requests.post() to Telegram API with file data and credentials",
  "flows": "find_files() retrieves files -> send_file_to_telegram() uploads files via network",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID; no input validation or dynamic credential handling",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file search and upload operations. It uses hardcoded credentials, which pose a security risk but do not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The network transmission of files is standard for such functionality. The security concern is primarily the exposure of credentials, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for file uploading via Telegram. The main security issue is the hardcoded credentials, which could be exploited if exposed. No malware or obfuscation detected. The security risk score should be moderate, around 0.5, reflecting credential exposure and data transmission concerns.",
