{
  "purpose": "The code searches for files with a specific extension in a given directory and sends them via Telegram using a bot token.",
  "sources": "The code reads the TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, CHAT_ID, and files found via find_files, then reads each file's content in send_file_to_telegram.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post call in send_file_to_telegram sends file data over the network to Telegram API, potentially leaking file contents.",
  "flows": "find_files gathers files from disk; send_file_to_telegram reads each file and transmits it via network to Telegram API.",
  "anomalies": "The Telegram bot token is hardcoded in the script, which is a security risk; no input validation or user input handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The script searches for files with a specified extension in a directory structure. It then sends each found file as a document to a Telegram chat using a hardcoded bot token. The token's hardcoded presence is a security concern, as it can be extracted or misused if the code is shared or compromised. The network request uses the requests library to POST data to Telegram's API endpoint, transmitting potentially sensitive files. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic, but the hardcoded token indicates possible malicious intent if misused for unauthorized data exfiltration or surveillance. Overall, the code is straightforward but contains a significant security risk due to hardcoded credentials and network transmission of files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is not malicious in intent but poses a security risk due to hardcoded credentials and data transmission to external service. It appears to be designed for file collection and sharing, which could be misused for unauthorized data exfiltration if credentials are compromised. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to credential hardcoding.",
