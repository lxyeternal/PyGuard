{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'neov'.",
  "sources": "The code reads package information from the setup() parameters, including reading 'README.md' for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data affects system behavior; no data is being processed or executed from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading 'README.md' into the long_description parameter during setup; no other data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "The URL contains non-ASCII characters ('ваш_username'), which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for packaging. It reads the long description from 'README.md' and specifies dependencies. No input validation, dynamic code execution, or network activity is present. The use of non-ASCII characters in the URL is unconventional but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, it appears to be a typical package configuration file without malicious or malicious-looking elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for packaging a Python project, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The use of a non-standard URL is unusual but not malicious.",
