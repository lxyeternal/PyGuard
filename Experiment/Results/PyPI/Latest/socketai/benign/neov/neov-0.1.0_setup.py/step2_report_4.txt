  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is a standard setup script with no malicious activity.\n- Notes the non-ASCII characters in the URL, which is unusual but not malicious.\n- Malware score: 0, Security risk: 0.  \n**Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also confirms the code is a typical setup script.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0, Security risk: 0.  \n**Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to others, notes the non-ASCII URL but considers it non-malicious.\n- Slightly raises security risk to 0.1 due to the URL anomaly.\n- Malware score: 0.  \n**Assessment:** Reasonable; the minor security risk is justified given the URL anomaly, but no malware.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Highlights the lack of error handling in reading 'README.md' but considers it standard.\n- No malicious activity detected.\n- Malware score: 0, Security risk: 0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct; no issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusions: standard setup script, no malicious behavior.\n- Notes the non-ASCII URL but finds it not malicious.\n- Malware score: 0, Security risk: 0.  \n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code presence:** The code is a typical setup.py script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No significant flaws or errors affecting security or functionality are evident.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature. Security risk scores are mostly 0, with one at 0.1 due to the URL anomaly—this is reasonable.\n- **Malware justification:** Since no malicious activity, code execution, or data exfiltration is present, malware score remains at 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** Based on the provided code, none are evident; the reading of 'README.md' without exception handling is standard in setup scripts.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated security risk score:** **0.1** (due to the unusual URL, but not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious intent or security issues. The minor anomaly in the URL does not elevate the risk significantly.\n\nPlease let me know if further detailed analysis or specific focus areas are needed.",
