  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'neov', defining metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; package metadata fields; dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network connections, data leaks, or code execution points.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script is static and does not process untrusted input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "URL contains non-ASCII characters ('ваш_username'), which is unusual but not malicious; no error handling for 'open' call, which is typical in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script using setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious logic. The only notable anomaly is the URL with non-ASCII characters, likely a placeholder or typo. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The reading of 'README.md' lacks exception handling but is standard practice. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, reflecting the benign nature. Security risk scores are low (mostly 0), with one at 0.1 due to the URL anomaly, which is justified. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features confirm its safe status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious intent or security issues. The non-ASCII URL is unusual but not malicious. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
