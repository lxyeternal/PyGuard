  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code presence and functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard `setup.py` script using setuptools.\n   - The code reads 'README.md' for long description and specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.\n   - No dynamic code execution, input validation, or network activity is present.\n\n2. **Malicious elements and anomalies**:\n   - The only unusual aspect noted across reports is the URL containing non-ASCII characters (`'https://github.com/ваш_username/qtpv'`).\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are observed.\n   - Reading 'README.md' without error handling is typical but could be a minor concern if the file is missing—yet this is standard practice.\n\n3. **Scores and their appropriateness**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - The security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report noting 0.1, which is acceptable given the URL anomaly.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1.0), reflecting the reviewers' consensus that the code is benign.\n\n4. **Risk and malware justification**:\n   - Since there's no evidence of malicious behavior, the malware score should remain at 0.\n   - The security risk score should stay low unless the URL's non-ASCII characters are considered suspicious, but they are more likely a placeholder or typo.\n   - The unusual URL does not impact the code's security posture significantly; it is more of a cosmetic or configuration concern.\n\n5. **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions**:\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the analysis correctly states that the code is standard.\n   - No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores**:\n   - All scores are consistent with the analysis—no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no significant security risks identified)\n\n**Additional considerations**:\n- The non-ASCII URL is unusual but not malicious; it could be a placeholder or typo.\n- The lack of error handling when reading 'README.md' is typical in setup scripts and not inherently risky.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or security issues. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Security risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the overall benign nature of the script and the absence of any malicious indicators.",
