  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the script only sets up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script with no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script used with setuptools for packaging a Python project. It specifies package info, dependencies, and classifiers. The only potentially risky element is reading 'README.md' for the long description, which is common practice. No malicious code, external data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
