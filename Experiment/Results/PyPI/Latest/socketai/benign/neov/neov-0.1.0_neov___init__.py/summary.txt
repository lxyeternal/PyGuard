  "conclusion": "The code pattern suggests potential malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, especially given access to '/root' and transmission of sensitive files. However, lacking implementation details of the imported functions, this remains suspicion rather than confirmed maliciousness. The scores should reflect a moderate to high risk and malware suspicion, but not certainty."
