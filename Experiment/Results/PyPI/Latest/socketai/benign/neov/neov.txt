      "conclusion": "The code pattern suggests potential malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, especially given access to '/root' and transmission of sensitive files. However, lacking implementation details of the imported functions, this remains suspicion rather than confirmed maliciousness. The scores should reflect a moderate to high risk and malware suspicion, but not certainty."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for file uploading via Telegram. The main security issue is the hardcoded credentials, which could be exploited if exposed. No malware or obfuscation detected. The security risk score should be moderate, around 0.5, reflecting credential exposure and data transmission concerns."
