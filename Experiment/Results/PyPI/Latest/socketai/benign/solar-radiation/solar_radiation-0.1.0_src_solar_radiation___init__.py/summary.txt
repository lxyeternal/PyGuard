  "obfuscated": 0.6,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that reports 1, 3, and 4 are appropriate in their zero scores due to lack of code. Report 2 correctly assesses benign code with minimal risk. Report 5 identifies red flags justifying moderate malware (0.4-0.6), obfuscation (0.6), and security risk (0.6). The scores are reasonable, but a slight upward adjustment of malware score in report 5 could be considered if further evidence suggests malicious activity. Overall, the evaluations are consistent and justified based on the provided information."
