{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no clear malicious intent or harmful operations identified.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly defined; the code does not read from external inputs such as files, network, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network transmissions, file writes, or system commands are observed; the code mainly performs internal calculations or data manipulations.",
  "flows": "Data flows through internal variables and functions without involving external sources or outputs; no source-to-sink data paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code constructs are detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "A step-by-step review shows standard function definitions and data manipulations without external inputs or malicious operations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code does not contain network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided fragment. It seems to serve a typical utility or processing function without any malicious intent.",
