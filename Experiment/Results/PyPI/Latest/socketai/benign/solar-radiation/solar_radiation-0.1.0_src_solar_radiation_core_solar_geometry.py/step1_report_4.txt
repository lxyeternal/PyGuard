  "purpose": "Calculate solar declination and incidence angle for solar geometry analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as day of year, latitude, declination, slope, azimuth, and hour angle.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit sinks for untrusted data; it performs mathematical computations and returns results.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used in trigonometric calculations to produce declination angles and incidence angles; no data flows to external systems or networks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code performs standard solar geometry calculations with no obfuscation or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions for calculating solar declination using two formulas and the incidence angle on a tilted surface. It uses standard math functions with proper input parameters. No user input reading, environment variable usage, or external calls that could be malicious. The calculations are straightforward, using trigonometric formulas common in solar geometry. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. No obfuscated code features. The code is well-structured, with clear documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate solar geometry calculations with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not engage in any suspicious activities or data leaks. The security risk is minimal, and there are no indications of malware or malicious behavior.",
