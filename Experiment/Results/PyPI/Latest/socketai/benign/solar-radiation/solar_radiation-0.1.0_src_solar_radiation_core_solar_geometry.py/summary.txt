  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-implemented set of functions for solar geometry calculations with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with the minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report being slightly conservative but acceptable. No modifications are necessary."
