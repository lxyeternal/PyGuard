{
  "purpose": "The code calculates solar declination and incidence angles based on date and geographical parameters, likely for solar energy or astronomical analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters: 'n' (day of year), 'latitude', 'declination', 'slope', 'surface_azimuth', and 'hour_angle'.",
  "sinks": "The code performs mathematical calculations and returns angle values. No data sinks such as network communication, file writing, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through mathematical formulas within functions, with no external data flow or untrusted input handling beyond parameters.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code performs straightforward mathematical calculations with standard math library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code employs trigonometric formulas to compute solar declination and incidence angles. It only uses standard math functions and input parameters. There are no signs of malicious code, network activity, data leaks, or backdoors. The calculations appear to be typical for solar geometry modeling. No hardcoded secrets or unsafe operations are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, mathematical implementation for solar geometry calculations. It does not contain malware or security risks. The functions are well-structured, use standard libraries, and do not exhibit obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
