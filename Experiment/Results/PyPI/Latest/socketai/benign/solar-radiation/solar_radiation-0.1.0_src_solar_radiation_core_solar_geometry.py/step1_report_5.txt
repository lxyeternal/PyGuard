  "purpose": "Calculate solar declination and incidence angle for solar geometry analysis.",
  "sources": [
    "Function parameters: n (day of year), latitude, declination, slope, surface_azimuth, hour_angle.",
    "Math functions: math.sin, math.cos, math.radians, math.degrees, math.acos."
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "math.acos output converted to degrees, which could be sensitive if misused.",
    "No direct data sink, but calculations involve physical parameters potentially used downstream."
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Input parameters (n, latitude, declination, slope, surface_azimuth, hour_angle) -> calculations involving math functions -> output angle values."
  ],
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. The code performs straightforward mathematical calculations for solar geometry.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to compute solar declination using two formulas and calculates the incidence angle based on geographic and solar parameters. All functions use standard math library functions without external data sources or network calls. No suspicious or malicious code segments detected. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code is well-structured and purely computational.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of solar geometry calculations with no malicious intent. It uses legitimate mathematical formulas and standard Python math functions. No indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
