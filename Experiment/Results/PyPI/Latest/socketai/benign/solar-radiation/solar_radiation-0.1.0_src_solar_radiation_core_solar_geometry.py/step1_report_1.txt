  "purpose": "The code calculates solar declination and incidence angle for solar geometry analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data includes 'n' (day of year), latitude, declination, slope, surface azimuth, and hour angle, all provided as function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; the code performs mathematical calculations without external data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through mathematical functions (sine, cosine, arccos) to compute angles; no external or untrusted data source or sink identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The code appears straightforward and mathematically correct.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises functions for solar declination calculation using two different formulas and an incidence angle calculation based on standard solar geometry equations. No external data sources, network communications, or suspicious code structures are present. The calculations involve standard trigonometric functions with no use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No hidden backdoors or malicious payloads are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard, well-understood mathematical computations related to solar geometry. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. The implementation appears clean and safe.",
