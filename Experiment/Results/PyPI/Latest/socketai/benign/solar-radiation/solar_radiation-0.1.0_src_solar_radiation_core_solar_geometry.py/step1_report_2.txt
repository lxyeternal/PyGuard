  "flows": [
    "Input parameters (e.g., n, latitude, declination, etc.) are processed through mathematical functions.",
    "Outputs (declination, incidence angle) are derived from these calculations."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or network operations.",
    "No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual language features.",
    "Standard mathematical calculations without external dependencies or side effects.",
    "All calculations are deterministic and straightforward."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code provides functions for calculating solar declination via two formulas and the angle of incidence on a tilted surface. All operations involve standard mathematical functions with no external input/output other than parameters, and no suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident. The functions do not perform any network operations, data leaks, or system modifications. The code appears to be a standard implementation of solar geometry formulas without any obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of solar geometry calculations, with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks. It appears to be purely computational with standard math operations.",
