{
  "purpose": "The code implements standard solar geometry calculations, including solar declination and incidence angle, using well-known formulas and straightforward math functions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as day of year, latitude, declination, slope, surface azimuth, and hour angle.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data sources; computations are purely mathematical with no data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into trigonometric calculations within each function; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The use of math.acos is handled safely with value clamping, and no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements standard solar declination formulas (Cooper's and Spencer's) and the incidence angle calculation. It relies solely on the math library, with no external dependencies or network activity. The code is transparent, well-documented, and free of malicious payloads. The only minor concern is the use of math.acos, which could be sensitive if misused, but the code clamps the input to [-1, 1], preventing domain errors. This is a standard practice and does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low, with a slight overestimation in one report (0.1). Overall, the code is safe, correct, and free of security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-implemented set of functions for solar geometry calculations with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with the minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report being slightly conservative but acceptable. No modifications are necessary.",
