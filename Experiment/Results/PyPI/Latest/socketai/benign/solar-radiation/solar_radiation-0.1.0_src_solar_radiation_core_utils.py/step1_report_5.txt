  "purpose": "Utility functions for solar position calculations, including date conversions, equation of time, hour angle, solar time, and sunrise/sunset hour angles.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from function arguments (datetime objects, integers, floats). No external or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform external actions. The code only processes mathematical calculations and date/time conversions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through mathematical functions (e.g., equation_of_time, hour_angle, solar_time) with no external data transmission or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The code strictly performs mathematical and date/time operations with standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of mathematical and date/time utility functions for solar position calculations. There are no data inputs from untrusted sources, nor are there any external sinks like network or file operations. The functions process input parameters to compute solar angles and times. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The code appears to be standard scientific calculation code with clear, straightforward logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for solar calculations with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It performs purely computational tasks based on provided inputs.",
