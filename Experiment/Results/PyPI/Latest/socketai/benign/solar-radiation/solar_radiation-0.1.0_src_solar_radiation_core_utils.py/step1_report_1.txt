{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for astronomical calculations related to solar time, sun position, and calendar date conversions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as date objects, datetime objects, latitude, longitude, timezone, and numerical values.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output to external systems or untrusted sources; it only processes and returns calculations internally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through mathematical computations within functions to produce results like angles, times, and date conversions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code uses standard Python libraries and straightforward mathematical formulas without any obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of well-defined, standard functions for date and astronomical calculations. No external input or output is used beyond function parameters and return values. There are no hardcoded credentials, network connections, or code injections. Functions like 'equation_of_time', 'hour_angle', and 'solar_time' implement known formulas without modification. The code relies solely on safe mathematical operations and datetime manipulations. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, mathematically driven utility module for solar and calendar calculations. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. The implementation is clear, safe, and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
