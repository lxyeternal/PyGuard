  "purpose": "A collection of utility functions for astronomical calculations related to solar position, date conversions, and time handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as date, time, latitude, longitude, and declination; no external data sources or user input during execution.",
  "sinks": "Return values of computed angles, times, and date-related integers; no data leaks or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into mathematical formulas and conversions, producing calculated outputs; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Minor potential precision issues due to truncation in time conversion functions; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard astronomical formulas using Python's math and datetime libraries. It handles domain bounds properly (e.g., cosine clamping). No external data or network operations are present. Minor truncation in time calculations could slightly affect precision but pose no security risk. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. The functions are straightforward and well-documented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for astronomical calculations. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. Minor accuracy improvements are possible but do not impact security assessment.",
