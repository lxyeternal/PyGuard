{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for solar position calculations, including day of year, leap year check, equation of time, hour angle, solar time conversion, sunrise/sunset hour angle, and time/minutes conversions.",
  "sources": "Reads date, time, latitude, longitude, and timezone inputs from function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data transmission points; no untrusted data outputs or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Processes input data (dates, times, geographic coordinates) through mathematical calculations to produce solar position metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and mathematical, with no suspicious obfuscated logic or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard solar calculations based on well-known formulas, utilizing mathematical operations and datetime manipulations. No external data sources, network communication, or storage operations are present. The functions are self-contained and focus solely on local calculations with safe data types. No signs of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or malicious code injection are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of solar position calculations with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a utility library for astronomical computations. No malicious behavior or security threats identified.",
