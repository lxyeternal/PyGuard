{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for astronomical calculations related to solar position, such as calculating the day of year, leap year status, equation of time, hour angle, solar time, sunrise/sunset hour angle, and time conversions.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, including date, time, latitude, longitude, and year.",
  "sinks": "Returns calculated numerical values such as angles, times, and date-related metrics; no data is sent externally or stored.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through mathematical calculations within functions, with no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded secrets, credentials, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code relies solely on standard library modules and mathematical formulas for astronomical calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of well-defined functions performing standard astronomical computations. It uses safe math operations, standard datetime handling, and mathematical formulas cited from established sources. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors. It does not interact with external systems, files, or network resources. The functions are deterministic and based solely on input parameters and mathematical formulas, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate set of astronomical utility functions with no malicious or suspicious behaviors. There are no indications of malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. It is a straightforward implementation of standard formulas for solar position calculations.",
