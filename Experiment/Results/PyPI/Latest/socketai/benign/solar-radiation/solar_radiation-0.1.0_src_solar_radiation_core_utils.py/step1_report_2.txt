  "purpose": "Utility functions for solar position calculations, including day of year, leap year, equation of time, hour angle, solar time, sunrise/sunset hour angle, and time conversions.",
  "sources": "Reads date objects, datetime objects, and numerical inputs such as latitude, longitude, timezone, and declination.",
  "sinks": "Returns numerical calculations, datetime objects, and time objects; no data is written to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input data (date, time, geographical coordinates) flows into calculations; results are returned as numerical or datetime values. No external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Usage of math and datetime libraries is standard for such calculations; no obfuscation or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward mathematical and datetime calculations for solar position analysis. Functions convert dates, compute solar angles, and perform time conversions. All operations are mathematically sound, with proper handling of edge cases such as cosine bounds. No network, file I/O, or system commands are used. No sensitive data, secrets, or environment variables are accessed. No obfuscation or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions for solar position calculations without any malicious intent. It uses standard libraries and performs purely computational tasks related to astronomy. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are present.",
