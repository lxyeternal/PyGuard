{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to calculate extraterrestrial solar radiation metrics, including irradiance and radiation over various time periods, based on solar geometry models.",
  "sources": "Inputs are n (day of year), latitude, and hour angles provided as parameters; dependencies include imported functions from .solar_geometry and .utils modules.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external resources, network, or files. It computes and returns numerical values without data leakage or external data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into calculations involving trigonometric functions and imported geometry functions, producing radiation metrics as output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code relies on standard scientific calculations without hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard solar radiation calculations using physics formulas, with proper mathematical handling and referencing external geometry functions. No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors. It does not include any network or system manipulation, data exfiltration, or suspicious logic. The imported modules are presumed to be benign. All computations are consistent with scientific standards.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of solar radiation models, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be legitimate scientific calculation code without hidden or malicious behavior.",
