  "sinks": [
    "Calculations involve mathematical functions without external data transmission or system modification.",
    "No apparent network, file, or system command operations."
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Input parameters flow into calculations of solar radiation metrics.",
    "Mathematical computations involve input data and return values related to solar radiation, without external data flow."
  ],
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads. The code uses standard mathematical functions and imports from local modules, presumed to be legitimate. No unusual code patterns, such as dynamic code execution or suspicious imports, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code calculates various solar radiation parameters using standard physics formulas, based on inputs like day of year and geographic location. It relies on imported functions, presumably legitimate, to compute declination and hour angles. The functions perform mathematical calculations with no external data access, network communication, or system manipulation. The code appears straightforward and typical for scientific calculations related to solar geometry, with no signs of malicious behavior or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for calculating extraterrestrial solar radiation metrics. There are no indications of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or security risks. It performs mathematical modeling based on accepted formulas, with no suspicious behaviors detected.",
