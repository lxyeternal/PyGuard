  "purpose": "Calculate extraterrestrial solar radiation metrics such as normal irradiance, horizontal irradiance, hourly, and daily radiation using standard physics formulas and solar geometry functions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: day of year (n), latitude, hour angles (omega1, omega2); external functions declination_spencer, sunrise_sunset_hour_angle for solar geometry calculations.",
  "sinks": "None; the code performs purely mathematical calculations without external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (n, latitude, hour angles) flow into formulas computing declination, hour angles, and irradiance; no external data flows or data exfiltration detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard solar radiation formulas relying on external, domain-specific functions presumed benign. It performs straightforward calculations with no network, file I/O, or malicious payloads. The use of math functions and formulas aligns with scientific literature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1), consistent across all reports. The code's purpose is scientific modeling, and it does not process untrusted input or perform system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of solar radiation calculations with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
