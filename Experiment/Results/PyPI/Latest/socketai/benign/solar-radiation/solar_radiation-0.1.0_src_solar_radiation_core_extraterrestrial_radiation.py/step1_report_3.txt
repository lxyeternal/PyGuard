{
  "purpose": "The code calculates extraterrestrial solar radiation parameters such as normal irradiance, horizontal irradiance, hourly and daily extraterrestrial radiation based on solar geometry and astronomical formulas.",
  "sources": "Reads data from function parameters: day of year (n), latitude, hour angles (omega1, omega2), and internal functions: declination_spencer, sunrise_sunset_hour_angle.",
  "sinks": "Uses the inputs to compute solar radiation values; no external data or untrusted input sources are involved in data handling or output.",
  "flows": "Inputs (n, latitude, hour angles) -> declination_spencer and sunrise_sunset_hour_angle functions -> calculations involving math functions -> output of radiation values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; the code performs straightforward mathematical computations related to solar radiation. No suspicious or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs domain-specific calculations using well-known astronomical formulas for solar radiation based on the day of year and geographical location. It relies on imported functions (declination_spencer, sunrise_sunset_hour_angle) which are presumed to be safe and relevant. No data leaks, no network operations, no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. The calculations are standard scientific formulas without any hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of solar radiation calculations with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate scientific module. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
