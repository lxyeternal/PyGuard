{
  "purpose": "The code calculates extraterrestrial solar radiation parameters based on date and location, likely for environmental or solar energy modeling.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include 'n' (day of year), 'latitude', 'hour_angle', 'omega1', and 'omega2' which are used to compute solar radiation metrics.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to write data to external systems or files; it performs internal mathematical calculations only.",
  "flows": "Inputs such as 'n', 'latitude', and hour angles flow into functions, with no external data outputs or network communications observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code strictly performs mathematical calculations related to solar radiation; no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The module imports standard math library functions and relies on external, presumably benign, modules for solar geometry and utilities. All calculations appear to be straightforward physics-based formulas for solar radiation, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or data exfiltration. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose aligns with environmental modeling, and it does not include any network, file I/O, or system commands that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard scientific computation module for solar radiation; no malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears safe and free from malicious intent.",
