{
  "purpose": "The code calculates extraterrestrial solar radiation parameters, including normal, horizontal, hourly, and daily irradiance, based on date and location inputs.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as 'n' (day of year), 'latitude', and hour angles ('omega1', 'omega2'). It also imports functions from other modules ('declination_spencer', 'equation_of_time', 'sunrise_sunset_hour_angle').",
  "sinks": "The code performs mathematical calculations without external data sinks; no network, file, or data leakage operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used in mathematical functions to compute solar radiation values; these computations do not involve data flows to external systems or resources.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors. The code uses standard mathematical formulas for solar radiation calculations. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variable names are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement well-known scientific formulas for calculating extraterrestrial solar radiation. It relies on standard math operations, constants, and straightforward function calls. All functions are deterministic and do not include any suspicious behaviors or potential entry points for malicious activity. The use of imports is from local modules, presumed to contain domain-specific functions, without any indication of malicious intent. No network, file, or system modification operations are present. The overall structure suggests a clean, scientific calculation module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of solar radiation calculations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs mathematical computations based on inputs without external data exfiltration or control. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
