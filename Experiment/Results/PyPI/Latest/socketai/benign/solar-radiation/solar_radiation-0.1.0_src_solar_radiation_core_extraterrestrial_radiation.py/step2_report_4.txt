  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code provides functions for calculating extraterrestrial irradiance and radiation, relying on standard physics formulas and external modules for solar geometry.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The calculations are standard scientific formulas. The malware score is 0, and security risk is low (0.1).\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly concludes the code is legitimate scientific computation with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the purpose for environmental or solar modeling, with no external data leaks or suspicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, network calls, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward scientific calculation.\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion that the code is safe and standard scientific code is justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the domain-specific calculations, relying on imported functions, with no external data handling or suspicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No malicious or suspicious code structures; standard formulas are used.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears to be a legitimate scientific module with no security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the use of standard formulas, with no external data sinks or malicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No network, file, or system modification operations. The functions are deterministic and straightforward.\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion of no malicious behavior is consistent with the code's structure.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard physics formulas for solar radiation, relying on imported domain-specific functions, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No external data leaks, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard scientific implementation, safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of solar radiation calculations, with no suspicious or malicious code patterns.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident. The functions rely on standard formulas and imported functions assumed to be safe.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and low security risks (~0.1). These are consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Justification for higher risk scores:** Given the code's scientific purpose and lack of external data handling or network activity, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code does not process untrusted input beyond parameters, and calculations are deterministic.\n- **Scores consistency:** The scores align well with the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n**Overall malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal security risk, mainly due to the module's scientific nature and dependencies, but no active vulnerabilities.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- The imported functions (`declination_spencer`, `sunrise_sunset_hour_angle`) should be verified for safety, but given their domain-specific purpose and standard usage, they are presumed benign.  \n- The code should be maintained with proper version control of dependencies to prevent malicious updates.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate scientific module for calculating extraterrestrial solar radiation, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1",
