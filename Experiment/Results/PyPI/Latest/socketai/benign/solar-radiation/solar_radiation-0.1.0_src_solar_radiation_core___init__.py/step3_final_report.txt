  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input variables, environment variables, external modules, user inputs, network connections.",
  "sinks": "Network communications, file operations, environment variable access, output streams.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or no code presence, with benign descriptions. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the descriptions. The absence of code or suspicious patterns supports a low threat level. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited information. No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks is found.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code appears benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the scores reflect this assessment accurately. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
