  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to the absence of visible code content; it appears to be a blank or empty file.",
  "sources": "There are no identifiable sources where the code reads input or data, as the code appears empty.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present in the code because no executable code is visible.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present due to the absence of code execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The file is completely empty with no code, which is unusual for a functional package or script. This could be an indicator of obfuscation or incomplete code, but likely just an empty or placeholder file.",
  "analysis": "The file contains no code to analyze, no input sources, sinks, or data flows. The absence of code precludes any malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. This may be a placeholder or an empty module, which does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The file appears to be empty or a placeholder, thus no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present.",
