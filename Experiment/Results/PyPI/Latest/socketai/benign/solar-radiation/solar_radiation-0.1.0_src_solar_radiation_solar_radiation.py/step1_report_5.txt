  "purpose": "Calculate extraterrestrial solar radiation and solar angles for given geographic and temporal parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as start_date, end_date, latitude, longitude, timezone, and surface angles.",
  "sinks": "Outputs a DataFrame with computed solar radiation values and optionally solar angles; no data leaks or external data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> validation -> loop over dates and times -> calculations of solar angles and radiation -> store in records -> DataFrame output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code performs standard astronomical calculations using mathematical functions and external utility modules. No untrusted external data sources or network operations are present. The use of zoneinfo is standard for timezone handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard and transparent solar radiation calculations based on well-known formulas and external utility functions. It validates input parameters, handles timezone conversions properly, and computes solar angles and extraterrestrial irradiance without any suspicious or malicious modifications. No signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious behavior are observed. The code’s purpose and logic are clear and consistent with typical scientific computation routines. No external or internal data leaks, backdoors, or malicious actions are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific calculation module for solar radiation estimation. There are no signs of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It uses standard libraries and transparent logic without suspicious anomalies. Therefore, the overall security risk is very low.",
