{
  "purpose": "Calculate extraterrestrial solar radiation parameters over a specified date range for given location and surface orientation.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as latitude, longitude, date range, timezone, surface tilt/azimuth, and optional flags; uses imported functions for solar geometry calculations.",
  "sinks": "No clear sink or output data leaks. Data is processed internally and returned as a pandas DataFrame. No network or system data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> Calculation functions -> Data generation loop -> DataFrame output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden functions. External utility functions are imported but their implementations are unknown, yet their usage appears standard for solar calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs parameter validation, date iteration, and solar geometry calculations for solar radiation. It uses standard Python modules and well-known libraries like pandas and zoneinfo. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network operations are present. The functions rely on imported utilities, but these seem relevant for solar calculations and not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or data leaks are evident. The code structure and logic are straightforward, focusing on solar data computation without hidden side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate solar radiation calculation module with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It performs standard calculations, validates input, and returns a DataFrame with computed values. No security risks are identified, and the overall code appears safe for use.",
