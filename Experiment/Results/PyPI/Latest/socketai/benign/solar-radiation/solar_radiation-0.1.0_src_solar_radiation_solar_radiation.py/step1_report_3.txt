  "purpose": "Calculate extraterrestrial solar radiation and related solar angles over a specified date range for given geographic coordinates and surface orientation.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters: start_date, end_date, latitude, longitude, timezone, surface_tilt, surface_azimuth, only_daytime, return_Gon, return_solar_angles; retrieves constants from imported modules (day_of_year, declination_spencer, extraterrestrial_normal_irradiance, incidence_angle); uses system functions for date/time and zone info.",
  "sinks": "Generates a DataFrame containing datetime, G_o (solar radiation), and optionally G_on, solar_elevation, solar_azimuth; no data leaks or untrusted data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → date/time calculations and solar geometry functions → calculation of solar angles and radiation → DataFrame output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No use of untrusted data sources, no suspicious network or file operations. Code appears to perform legitimate scientific calculations with proper validation and handling. The import of 'zoneinfo' and use of standard date/time libraries are appropriate. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution identified.",
  "analysis": "The code performs solar radiation calculations with proper input validation, time zone handling, and use of domain-specific functions for solar geometry. It uses standard Python libraries and well-defined functions. No malicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The use of 'ZoneInfo' for timezone handling is standard. The code is logically structured and focuses solely on solar calculations. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific computation module for solar radiation modeling. It contains no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The implementation is clear, with appropriate validation and no malicious side effects.",
