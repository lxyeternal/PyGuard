  "purpose": "Calculate extraterrestrial solar radiation and related solar angles over a specified date range, with options for surface tilt, azimuth, and time granularity.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as latitude, longitude, start/end dates, timezone, surface tilt/azimuth, and optional flags; internal functions for date and solar calculations.",
  "sinks": "Outputs a pandas DataFrame with computed solar radiation values and angles; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads input parameters; iterates over date and time ranges; computes solar angles and extraterrestrial radiation; stores results in DataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard solar radiation calculations with proper input validation, timezone handling, and iterative processing. It relies on domain-specific utility functions that appear legitimate. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The use of ZoneInfo for timezone management and clamping of cosine values indicates correct implementation. The optional outputs and flags are straightforward. Overall, the code is transparent, well-structured, and aligns with scientific computation standards.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of solar radiation calculations with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score of 0.1 are consistent with the analysis and the code's purpose.",
