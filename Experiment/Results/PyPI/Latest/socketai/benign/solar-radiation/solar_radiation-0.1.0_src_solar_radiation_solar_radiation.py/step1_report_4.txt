  "purpose": "Calculate extraterrestrial solar radiation and related solar geometry parameters over a specified date range for given location and surface orientation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: start_date, end_date, latitude, longitude, timezone, surface_tilt, surface_azimuth, only_daytime, return_Gon, return_solar_angles.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is sent over network, written to files, or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to generate datetime ranges and compute solar angles; calculations derive G_o and optionally G_on and angles; data is stored in a DataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "Code performs standard calculations with appropriate bounds checks; no suspicious or unusual code, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function for solar radiation calculations with parameter validation, timezone handling, and iterative computation over date ranges. It uses established modules and calculations without suspicious operations. No hardcoded secrets or external network activity are observed. The function processes data locally and outputs a DataFrame of computed values.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate solar radiation calculation utility without malicious intent. It follows standard practices and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
