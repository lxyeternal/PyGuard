{
  "purpose": "Calculate extraterrestrial solar radiation parameters based on geographic and temporal inputs, returning a DataFrame with solar radiation and angle data.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as start_date, end_date, timezone, latitude, longitude, surface angles, and time interval.",
  "sinks": "Outputs a DataFrame with computed solar radiation values and optional solar angles; does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> validation checks -> date iteration -> solar geometry calculations -> data collection -> DataFrame output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden data transmission observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard calculations for solar radiation using well-known formulas and standard Python libraries. It correctly validates inputs, uses zoneinfo for timezone management, and iterates over date and time ranges to generate data. No use of insecure practices, external network calls, or obfuscated logic is present. Dependencies are import statements, with no suspicious imports or code injection points. The code appears to be a legitimate scientific computation module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured solar radiation calculation script without signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs calculations based on input parameters and outputs results locally, with no external communications or hidden actions.",
