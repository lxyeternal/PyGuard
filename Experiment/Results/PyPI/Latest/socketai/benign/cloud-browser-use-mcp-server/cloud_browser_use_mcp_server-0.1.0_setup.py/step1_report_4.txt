  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'cloud-browser-use-mcp-server' intended to facilitate browser automation via MCP server.",
  "sources": "Read from 'src' directory for packages, 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data flows to external systems, network, or environment variables are evident.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity; dependencies are installed as required.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration, importing setuptools and defining package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and classifiers. It references common and well-known dependencies, with no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network calls within the script itself. The 'long_description' reads from 'README.md', which is typical. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a normal setup configuration script for a Python package. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident from the provided code. The package seems intended for legitimate use, with no indicators of sabotage.",
