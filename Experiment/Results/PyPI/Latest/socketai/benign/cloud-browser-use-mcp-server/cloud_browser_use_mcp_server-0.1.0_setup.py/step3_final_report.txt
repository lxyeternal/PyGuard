{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging the 'cloud-browser-use-mcp-server' Python project.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file without a context manager; package dependencies and entry point definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or external data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No dynamic code execution or data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without a context manager for reading 'README.md'; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools, with dependencies and entry points typical for a Python package. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior is present. The only minor concern is the file open without a context manager, which is a coding best practice but not security-related. No network activity, untrusted input, or payloads are detected. All dependencies are standard, and the setup process is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard packaging script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor coding style issue does not impact security. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
