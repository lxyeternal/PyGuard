  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project related to automating browser tasks via a custom API.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, specifies dependencies, and defines entry points for CLI.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or output that could cause data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Reads static files for metadata, installs specified dependencies, and registers CLI entry points; no dynamic data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors detected. The use of standard setup tools and conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It specifies project metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry points in a typical manner. The only potentially sensitive operation is reading 'README.md' for the long description, which is a normal practice and does not pose security risks. No code execution, data processing, or network activity occurs here. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python library. It appears legitimate with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
