{
  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'cloud-browser-use-mcp-server'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description, defining dependencies, and setting entry points for CLI.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no network or file operations other than reading a file and package setup.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' -> package setup with dependencies and entry point -> execution of 'server:main' when CLI invoked.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without context manager for reading 'README.md' may cause resource warning; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies dependencies, package directories, metadata, and CLI entry points. No user input, network activity, or untrusted data processing is involved. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present. The open() call for 'README.md' is a minor concern but not malicious. Overall, the script appears to be a typical, benign packaging script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It merely prepares the package for distribution and does not contain any harmful behavior.",
