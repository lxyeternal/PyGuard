  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'cloud-browser-use-mcp-server', including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading package requirements, package metadata, and README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no external data is processed or outputted unsafely.",
  "flows": "No malicious data flows detected; configuration data flows from setup parameters to package build process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies dependencies, package locations, entry points, and metadata. All elements follow common practices; no signs of malicious behavior or anomalies. The package dependencies are typical, and no unsafe code or data leaks are evident. The README is read for description, which is standard. The configuration appears legitimate and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with no malicious or suspicious content detected. It appears safe and intended for normal package distribution.",
