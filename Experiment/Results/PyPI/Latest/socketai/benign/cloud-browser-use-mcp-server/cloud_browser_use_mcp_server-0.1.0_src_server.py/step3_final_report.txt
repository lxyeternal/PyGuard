{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Python MCP server managing browser automation tasks via an external API, providing tools for task control, status, and account management.",
  "sources": "Reads API key from environment variable or CLI argument; interacts with external API endpoints for task operations and status checks.",
  "sinks": "API requests and responses; outputs formatted task details and status messages; no data leaks or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Input instructions and parameters are sent to API; task IDs are used to poll status; responses are processed to produce user-facing output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; code structure is clear and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured API client and server for managing browser automation tasks, with proper error handling, input validation, and secure API key management via environment variables. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. External API interactions are standard, and response handling is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration or system sabotage. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to external API reliance, but no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, secure, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. It functions as a standard API client/server for browser automation management. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.15, reflecting minimal external API dependency without inherent vulnerabilities.",
