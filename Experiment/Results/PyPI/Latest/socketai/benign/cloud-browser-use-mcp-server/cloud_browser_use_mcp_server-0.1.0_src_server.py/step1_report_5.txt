{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Python-based MCP server for managing and automating browser tasks via a remote API, including task creation, status checking, and account management.",
  "sources": "Reads API key from environment variable and command-line argument; interacts with external API endpoints for task operations and balance checks.",
  "sinks": "API requests to external server with authorization; responses processed for task details and status; logs for errors.",
  "flows": "API key read -> API requests (run, get, stop, pause, resume tasks, check balance) -> responses parsed and displayed; command-line invocation triggers server startup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Usage of API key is standard; no unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard API client and server wrapper for managing browser automation tasks. It securely handles API key via environment variables, performs typical HTTP requests with error handling, and provides a structured API interface. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The logging is appropriate for debugging and error tracking. All third-party libraries used are common and properly employed. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate MCP server implementation for managing browser automation tasks via a remote API. It follows good security practices, handles data securely, and contains no malicious or suspicious behaviors.",
