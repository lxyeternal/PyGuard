{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Python-based MCP server for managing browser automation tasks via an external API, providing tools to run, monitor, pause, resume, and list tasks, as well as check account balance.",
  "sources": "API key input via environment variable or command-line argument, and data retrieved from external API endpoints (e.g., task status, task details, balance).",
  "sinks": "API requests sending task instructions and control commands; API responses processed and formatted for output.",
  "flows": "Input API key → API client requests (run, get, stop, pause, resume tasks, check balance) → API responses processed into human-readable or structured output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets found. No suspicious or unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors. Use of environment variable for API key is standard. No signs of malicious data exfiltration, code injection, or unauthorized system access.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured, using standard libraries and clear API interactions. The API key is sourced from an environment variable or CLI argument, typical for secure credential management. All API interactions use proper request methods and error handling. No signs of malicious behavior such as data theft, backdoors, or network exfiltration. The functions mainly coordinate API requests, handle responses, and format output for user. No obfuscated code or hidden logic detected. The code does not perform any unsafe operations outside expected API communication and task management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a Python MCP server for managing browser automation tasks with external API interactions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It uses standard practices for API communication, error handling, and credential management.",
