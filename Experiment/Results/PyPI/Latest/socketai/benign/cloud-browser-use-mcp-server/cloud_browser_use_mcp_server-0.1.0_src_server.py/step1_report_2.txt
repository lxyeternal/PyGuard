{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Python-based MCP server for managing browser automation tasks via an external API, providing tools for task control and status querying, and integrating with a prompt system.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters for API key, task instructions, task IDs, structured output JSON schemas, and command-line options.",
  "sinks": "Uses untrusted input for API requests, task instructions, and task IDs, which are then sent to external API endpoints; outputs are formatted as text messages and responses.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (API key, instructions, task IDs) are passed into API client methods which send HTTP requests to external server endpoints; responses are processed and returned as formatted text.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets found; no obfuscated or unusual code structures; all external interactions are via standard API calls. No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a client-server architecture for managing browser automation tasks through an external API, with secure handling of input parameters and proper exception handling. It does not contain code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The API key is obtained via environment variable or command-line argument, not hardcoded. The HTTP requests use standard methods, and responses are processed securely. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident, and the code appears focused on legitimate task management functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a task management MCP server interfacing with an external API. It performs input validation, handles errors properly, and does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
