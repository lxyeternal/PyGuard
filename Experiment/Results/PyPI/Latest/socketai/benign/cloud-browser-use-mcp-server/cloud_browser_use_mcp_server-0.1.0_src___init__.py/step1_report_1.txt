  "purpose": "Provide an entry point to run the 'server' module for automating browser tasks via the Browser Use MCP protocol.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'server' module, asyncio.run(server.main()) call",
  "sinks": "Call to server.main() via asyncio.run, which executes server's main function",
  "flows": "User invokes main(), which triggers asyncio.run() to execute server.main()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or operations",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as an entry point to run a server module asynchronously. It imports a local module 'server' and executes its main() function within asyncio.run(). There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or hidden backdoors. The code is straightforward and appears to be part of a larger project. It explicitly states that the package is unofficial and not endorsed by the browser provider, which is a transparency note but does not impact security analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard bootstrap script for executing a server component asynchronously. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this code fragment.",
