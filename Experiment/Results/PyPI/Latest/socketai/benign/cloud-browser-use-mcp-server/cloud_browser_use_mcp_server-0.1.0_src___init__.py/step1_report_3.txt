  "purpose": "Provide an entry point for the Browser Use MCP server for automating browser tasks using the Browser Use API.",
  "sources": "import statement for 'server', usage of asyncio.run(server.main())",
  "sinks": "Execution of server.main() which may include untrusted code execution depending on server implementation",
  "flows": "main() calls asyncio.run(server.main()), which may execute server code possibly handling external input or network requests",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No obfuscated code. The description notes it's an unofficial server but doesn't indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports a server module, defines a main() function that runs server.main() asynchronously, and exposes main and server in __all__. There are no evident malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity within this snippet. The server module's internal behavior is not shown, so the risk depends on its implementation, but from this code alone, there is no indication of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple entry point to run the server module. No malicious behavior is evident in this fragment. The security risk depends on the server's implementation, but the code itself appears benign.",
