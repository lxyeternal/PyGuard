{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point for a package that interacts with a server component to automate browser tasks via a Model Context Protocol.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import, the version string, and the execution of the server.main() function within asyncio.run().",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the invocation of server.main() which could potentially perform network or system operations depending on its implementation, but that is outside the scope of this code fragment.",
  "flows": "The flow starts from importing server, then the main() function calls asyncio.run(server.main()), which initiates server operations potentially involving network communication or system tasks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code appears straightforward and serves a typical purpose of executing server logic asynchronously.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a main() function that runs server.main() within an asyncio event loop. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is minimal, clearly documented, and only manages the execution of server logic. No external inputs, user data, or environment variables are directly used or mishandled. Given that server.main() could contain malicious code, this script's risk depends on the implementation of that function, but based solely on this fragment, there are no indicators of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple bootstrap for a server component that automates browser tasks. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment. The overall security depends on server.main(), which is not provided. No anomalies or suspicious features are detected.",
