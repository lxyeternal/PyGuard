{
  "purpose": "Defines a package for a browser automation server using the Browser Use API, with an entry point to run the server.",
  "sources": "Import statements for the 'server' module, reading the __version__ string, and the 'asyncio.run(server.main())' call.",
  "sinks": "The 'asyncio.run' function executes 'server.main()', which could be a sink if it contains untrusted code execution, but details are not provided here.",
  "flows": "Main function calls 'asyncio.run' with 'server.main()' as the flow, initiating server execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and only sets up the server's main entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as an entry point to run a server module. It imports a server component, defines a main() function that runs 'server.main()' asynchronously, and exposes key functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity within this fragment. Without additional context about the 'server' module, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple entry script for a server package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be standard boilerplate code for a Python package entry point.",
