  "purpose": "Bootstrap script to run server.main() asynchronously as part of a Python package for automating browser tasks.",
  "sources": "Import of local 'server' module, usage of asyncio.run() to execute server.main()",
  "sinks": "None within this code fragment; potential sink depends on server.main() implementation",
  "flows": "The main() function calls server.main() via asyncio.run()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward and standard structure, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal bootstrap that imports a local server module and executes its main() function asynchronously. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of server.main(), which is not provided. The code itself is benign, with no errors or flaws. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by the simplicity of the code and the dependency on external server logic. The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward entry point with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, contingent on the server module’s implementation. No further action is necessary based on this fragment.",
