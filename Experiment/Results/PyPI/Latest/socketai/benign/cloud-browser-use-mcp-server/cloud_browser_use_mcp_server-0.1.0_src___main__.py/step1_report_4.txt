{
  "purpose": "The code appears to serve as an entry point for executing a 'main' function from a module named 'server'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the '__name__' variable and imports 'main' from the local 'server' module.",
  "sinks": "The code executes the 'main()' function if the script is run as the main program.",
  "flows": "The script checks if it is the main module, then calls 'main()' which may contain further data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code itself is minimal and straightforward; no suspicious or unusual patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code serves as a typical Python script entry point, importing 'main' from a local module and executing it when run directly. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as dynamic code execution, network communication, or data exfiltration. The minimal structure suggests it's part of a larger, possibly benign application. Without seeing the 'server' module, no further malicious indicators can be inferred. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python entry point with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based on this snippet alone.",
