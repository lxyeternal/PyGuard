{
  "purpose": "The code appears to serve as an entry point for a module, importing a main function from a server module and executing it if run directly.",
  "sources": "The only source of input is the import statement 'from .server import main', which imports a function from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks in this snippet; the main function is invoked, but its implementation is unknown.",
  "flows": "The flow is: if the script is executed directly, it calls the main() function imported from the server module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for a Python entry point; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a main function from a local server module and executes it if the script is run as the main program. It lacks any direct input handling, data processing, or network activity within this snippet. The security of the overall program depends on the implementation of 'main()' in the server module, which is not provided. As such, based solely on this snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a typical Python script entry point, with no observable malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment. Any potential concerns would depend on the contents of the 'server' module and the 'main()' function, which are not included here.",
