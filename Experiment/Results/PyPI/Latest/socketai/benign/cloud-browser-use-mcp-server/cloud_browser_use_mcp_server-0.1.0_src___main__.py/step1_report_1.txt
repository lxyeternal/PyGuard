  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in this minimal script; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script simply imports a main function from a local module and executes it when run directly. Without access to the server module's implementation, no malicious behavior can be inferred from this snippet alone. The structure is standard for Python entry points. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious activity in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as an entry point to execute a server-related main function. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this limited snippet. The security posture depends entirely on the implementation of server.main().",
