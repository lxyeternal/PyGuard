{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point that imports and executes the 'main' function from the 'server' module.",
  "sources": "The 'main' function imported from the local 'server' module.",
  "sinks": "The execution of 'main()' when the script is run directly.",
  "flows": "The script imports 'main' from '.server' and executes it if the script is run as the main module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "This code is a typical Python script entry point. It imports a function named 'main' from a local module 'server' and executes it if the script is run directly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code patterns. The code relies on the implementation of 'main' in 'server', which is not provided here, so any malicious activity would depend on that module. Based solely on this snippet, no malicious or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard entry point for a Python application with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks within this fragment.",
