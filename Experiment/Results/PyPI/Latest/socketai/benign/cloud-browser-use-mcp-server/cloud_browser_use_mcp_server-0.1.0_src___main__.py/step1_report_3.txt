  "purpose": "This code imports a main function from a server module and executes it if the script is run as the main program.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .server import main",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() function when run as main program",
  "flows": "Import .server.main -> __main__ check -> main() execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and standard for Python scripts",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward entry point that imports a main function from a local server module and calls it if the script is executed directly. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are present. The import is relative, indicating it’s part of a package. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or other risky operations visible in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as an entry point for executing functionality defined in the server module. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected based on this fragment.",
