  "purpose": "A CLI tool for interacting with OpenAI's GPT models via API, facilitating chat sessions.",
  "sources": "User input via input(), environment variables for API key, and the model name string.",
  "sinks": "API call to openai.chat.completions.create() which sends messages to the OpenAI server.",
  "flows": "User input -> messages list -> API call -> response -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "Model name 'gpt-4o' appears to be a typo; no input validation or sanitization; reliance on environment variables for API key.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper for OpenAI's API, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious code. The primary concern is the model name 'gpt-4o', which is likely a typo and could cause runtime errors. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or obfuscated code are present. The code relies on environment variables for API keys, which is standard. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2) due to the typo, which could impact operational stability but not security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning as a CLI interface for OpenAI's API. The only notable issue is the typo in the model name 'gpt-4o', which should be corrected. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
