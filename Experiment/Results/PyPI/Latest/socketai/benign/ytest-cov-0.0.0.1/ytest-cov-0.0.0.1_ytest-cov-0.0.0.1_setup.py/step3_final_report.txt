  "purpose": "Define package metadata for a placeholder Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters: name, version, author, author_email, description, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data assigned directly to setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields; no dynamic code, obfuscation, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with static, hardcoded metadata. No dynamic or malicious behavior is present. The empty author fields are unusual but not suspicious. No obfuscation or external data flows are detected. The code serves as a placeholder package, which is benign. The scores from reports correctly identify no malware or obfuscation, with only a minor overestimation of risk in one report. Given the benign nature, the overall security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal setup script for a placeholder package. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate; the only adjustment is to set the risk score to 0 for consistency.",
