  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network calls, dynamic imports, system calls.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file system modifications, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network inputs flow into code execution or data handling points, potentially leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, environment variable usage, network communication, but no hardcoded secrets or payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits some obfuscation and dynamic features but no clear malicious patterns. The low malware score (0.1) reflects minimal suspicion. Obfuscation score (0.4) aligns with the dynamic features. Security risk (0.2) accounts for potential but unconfirmed vulnerabilities. The absence of code in some reports justifies zero scores. Overall, the code appears benign with minor caution warranted for obfuscation and dynamic execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is largely benign with some obfuscation and dynamic features that do not currently indicate malicious intent. Scores are consistent with the observed features and summaries. No significant security threats identified.",
