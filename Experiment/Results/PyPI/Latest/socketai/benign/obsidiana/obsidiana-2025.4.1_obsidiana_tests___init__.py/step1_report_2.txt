  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a web server and handle incoming HTTP requests, possibly to serve content or APIs.",
  "sources": "Input data from HTTP request parameters, headers, or URL paths.",
  "sinks": "Data output via HTTP responses, possibly logging functions or external API calls.",
  "flows": "Input data from HTTP requests are processed and then used in responses or logs, potentially reaching external services.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no obvious malicious function calls detected. Usage of dynamic execution or code injection points is absent.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a web server using a standard framework. It reads data from incoming requests and responds accordingly. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious command execution, or suspicious network activity are evident. The code does not contain any unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. It adheres to standard practices for web request handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical web server implementation with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates as expected without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
