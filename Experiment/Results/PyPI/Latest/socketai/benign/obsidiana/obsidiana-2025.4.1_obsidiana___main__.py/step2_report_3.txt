  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the appropriateness of the scores, and any potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is minimal: just an import and a function call.\n- All reports agree that the code itself appears benign and straightforward.\n- The core concern revolves around the behavior of the external package `obsidiana` and its `_cli` module, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is a simple CLI launcher, with no suspicious activity or anomalies.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n\n- **Logical errors:** None. The reports correctly identify that the main concern depends on the external package's implementation.\n- **Potential over-interpretation:** Some reports mention \"potential\" risks or concerns about malicious behavior in the external package, which is valid but cannot be confirmed from this code alone.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.3, which seems reasonable considering the code's reliance on an external package.\n- **Confidence scores:** Vary from 0.6 to 0.9, reflecting the varying degrees of certainty about the external package's trustworthiness.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n\n- The code's security risk depends entirely on the trustworthiness of `obsidiana`.\n- Since the code simply calls `_cli.main()`, if that function contains malicious code, the risk is high.\n- However, in the absence of evidence, the risk is low but not zero.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n\n- Some reports assume that `obsidiana._cli.main()` could execute malicious code, which is a valid concern but cannot be confirmed here.\n- No reports claim that the code itself is malicious; all agree it's a benign wrapper.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code within this snippet)\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n\n**Risk score:** Given the dependency on an external package, a conservative estimate would be around **0.2 to 0.3**, reflecting some risk due to external dependency but no direct evidence.\n\n**Confidence:** I would place confidence at around **0.8**, acknowledging that the main concern hinges on the external package's trustworthiness.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Score Type     | My Estimated Value | Justification                                                                                 |\n|----------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                    | No malicious code detected; external package behavior unknown but outside this code snippet. |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                    | Code is straightforward; no obfuscation present.                                              |\n| Security Risk  | 0.2 - 0.3            | Slight risk due to reliance on external package; no direct malicious activity evident.     |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The core security concern is the trustworthiness of the `obsidiana` package. If it is from a reputable source and maintained, the risk remains low. If the package is compromised or malicious, the risk could be significant, but this cannot be determined from the code snippet alone.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to prepare a summarized report or recommendations based on this analysis?**",
