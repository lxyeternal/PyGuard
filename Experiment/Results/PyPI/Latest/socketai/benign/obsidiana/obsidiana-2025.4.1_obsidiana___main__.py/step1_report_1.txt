  "flows": "Import from obsidiana -> execution of _cli.main()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; straightforward import and method call. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a CLI handler from the obsidiana module and executes its main function. There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The module name suggests it is for Obsidian vault management, which aligns with the stated purpose. Since the code relies entirely on the obsidiana package, any malicious behavior would be dependent on that package's implementation, which is outside this code snippet. The code itself is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple wrapper that runs a command-line interface for the obsidiana module. It does not contain malicious behavior itself, but the security of the overall operation depends on the integrity of the obsidiana package. There are no signs of malware or malicious activity in this snippet.",
