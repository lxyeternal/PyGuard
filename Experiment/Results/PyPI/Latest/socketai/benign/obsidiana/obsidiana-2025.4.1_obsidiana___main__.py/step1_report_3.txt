  "flows": "Importing module -> executing _cli.main()",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; straightforward import and function call with no parameters or input handling",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named 'obsidiana' and calls its _cli.main() function. There are no hardcoded credentials, environment variables, or dynamic code execution. The use of a private-looking module (_cli) might suggest internal or semi-private API usage, but does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. The code is minimal, with no data inputs, outputs, or suspicious control flows. The only point of concern is the call to an external module's main function, which could execute external code, but this is standard for CLI tools.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited code provided, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a simple script to invoke a command-line interface from the obsidiana module, likely for Obsidian vault management. No suspicious or malicious activities are detected.",
