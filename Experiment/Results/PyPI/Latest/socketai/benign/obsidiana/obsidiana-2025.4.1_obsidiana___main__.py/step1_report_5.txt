  "sources": "Importing the '_cli' module from the 'obsidiana' package.",
  "sinks": "Calling '_cli.main()' as an entry point, potentially executing command-line interface logic.",
  "flows": "Importing '_cli' and executing '_cli.main()' which likely processes input from command line arguments or environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; the code is straightforward. The only notable aspect is the direct call to a main function from an imported module, which is typical for CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a CLI module from the 'obsidiana' package and executes its main function. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The 'obsidiana' package is external, and the code appears to serve as an entry point for a CLI tool related to Obsidian vaults. Without additional context about the 'obsidiana' package, no malicious behavior is apparent. The code structure is simple and typical for CLI scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script acts as a straightforward CLI launcher for the 'obsidiana' package. No malicious code or suspicious behavior is detected within this fragment. It is a benign entry point.",
