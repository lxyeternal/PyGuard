{
  "purpose": "The function test_it_imports is designed to import the 'obsidiana' module, likely as a test to verify if the module can be imported without errors.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'import obsidiana' is the source of data input, loading the module into the runtime environment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or security effects; the code merely imports a module.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: source (import statement) loads 'obsidiana' into memory, with no further data processing or transfer.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is minimal and standard for a simple import test. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that imports the 'obsidiana' module, possibly for testing its availability or correctness. No untrusted input handling, no data leakage, no suspicious code paths, and no signs of malicious intent. The import statement is standard, and the 'noqa: F401' comment suppresses unused import warnings, indicating the module might be used elsewhere or for side effects. Overall, the code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import test with no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It likely serves a basic verification purpose for the presence or functionality of the 'obsidiana' package.",
