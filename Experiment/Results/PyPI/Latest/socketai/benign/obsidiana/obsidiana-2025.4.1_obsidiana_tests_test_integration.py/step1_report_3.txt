{
  "purpose": "The function test_it_imports is intended to verify that the module 'obsidiana' can be successfully imported.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'import obsidiana' reads the module from the environment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data or execute code based on external input.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving user input or untrusted sources; the flow is limited to a straightforward import.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable aspect is the use of '# noqa: F401' to suppress linting warnings about an unused import. No other anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test function that imports a module named 'obsidiana'. This import could be used to check if the module loads without error. The suppression comment indicates the import is intentionally unused in this function. No other code or malicious indicators are present. The code is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple import to test module availability. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only notable aspect is the suppression of unused import warnings, which does not suggest malicious intent.",
