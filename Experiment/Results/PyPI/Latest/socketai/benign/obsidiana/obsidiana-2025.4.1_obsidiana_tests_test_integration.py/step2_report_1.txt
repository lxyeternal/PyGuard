  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple test function importing the 'obsidiana' module.\n- No suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious intent are identified.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.\n- The use of `# noqa: F401` is noted but not considered suspicious; it’s standard practice to suppress unused import warnings.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code's purpose appears solely to verify importability or availability of the module.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present.\n- No anomalies or indicators of malicious activity are reported beyond the benign import pattern.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Obfuscated score:** consistently 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0, indicating no malicious behavior detected or suspected.\n- **Security risk score:** 0, as the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), consistent with the straightforward analysis.\n- No report suggests any reason to elevate the risk or malware scores.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I agree with the assigned scores.\n- There is no evidence of obfuscation or malware, so the scores are appropriate.\n- The purpose is purely to test importability, with no security implications.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just a basic import test, no risk involved)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores reflect this well.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code's purpose is purely functional testing of module importability. No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.",
