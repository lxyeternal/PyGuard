  "sinks": "No sinks; no data is being processed or transmitted",
  "flows": "Import statement directly loads the module into memory",
  "anomalies": "Single import statement; no suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple function that imports the 'obsidiana' module to test its importability. There are no other operations, no data processing, and no suspicious constructs. The import is standard and does not involve dynamic execution or obfuscated code. No credentials, network connections, or data leaks are present. The minimal code suggests a basic test routine, with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import test with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
