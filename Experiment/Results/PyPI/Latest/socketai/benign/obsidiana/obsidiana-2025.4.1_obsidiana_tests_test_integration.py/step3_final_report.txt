{
  "purpose": "A simple test function that imports the 'obsidiana' module to verify its availability.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'import obsidiana' within the function 'test_it_imports'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output or network operations.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement; there are no downstream sinks or data flows, as the code only imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with a standard import and a linter suppression comment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal function importing 'obsidiana' with a comment to suppress unused import warnings. It performs no dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling. All reviews agree that it is benign, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature. The high confidence levels are justified given the simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import test with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
