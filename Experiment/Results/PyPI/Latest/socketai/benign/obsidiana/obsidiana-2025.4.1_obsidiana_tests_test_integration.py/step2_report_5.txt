  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content**:\n   The code is a simple function:\n   ```python\n   def test_it_imports():\n       import obsidiana  # noqa: F401\n   ```\n   It only imports the `obsidiana` module, with a comment to suppress unused import warnings.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - The code itself is minimal, standard for a basic import test.\n   - No suspicious behavior, such as dynamic code execution, network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n   - No data leaks or processing of untrusted input.\n   - The import is static and straightforward.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, intended solely for testing importability.\n   - No anomalies, such as obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns, are identified.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), indicating strong agreement on benignity.\n   - Malware scores are 0 across all reports, consistent with no malicious activity.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n   - **Security Risk**: All assign 0, justified given the benign nature.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Misjudgments**:\n   - Given the simplicity, there is no reason to increase any scores.\n   - The purpose of the code is explicitly to test importability, not to execute untrusted code or perform malicious actions.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The code is benign.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n   - No modifications needed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score |\n|------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                      |\n| Risk             | 0                      |\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a minimal, benign import test with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
