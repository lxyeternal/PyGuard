{
  "purpose": "The function 'test_it_imports' is designed to test whether the 'obsidiana' module can be successfully imported.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'import obsidiana' is the only source, which loads a module during function execution.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or transmit data, nor does it perform any operations beyond importing a module.",
  "flows": "The source 'import obsidiana' flows directly into the import system; no data is passed or processed further.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains an import statement within a test function, but nothing inherently unusual or suspicious about this behavior; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple test function that imports a module named 'obsidiana' without any additional logic. It appears to be a basic test or placeholder. No malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is present. The import could potentially be used for testing if the module is installable or functional but does not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement within a test function with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is likely used to verify the presence or importability of the 'obsidiana' package.",
