{
  "purpose": "Provide constants, helper functions, and utilities for GUI app management, including layout calculations, flow control, help ID management, and resource registration.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules (ae.base, ae.paths, ae.i18n), regex patterns, environment variables, and internal function calls.",
  "sinks": "Function calls such as os_path_join, os_path_dirname, and dynamic string formatting for flow IDs and class names. No direct data leaks or unsafe system commands detected.",
  "flows": "Input data from function parameters (e.g., flow_id, help_id, widget attributes) flow through validation, string manipulation, and resource registration functions without evident malicious payloads. Resource registration uses local file paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious hardcoded secrets. The code relies on external modules for key functionality; no obfuscated code patterns are detected. No suspicious network activity, system modifications, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily utility functions and constants for GUI management, involving layout calculations, flow ID parsing, help ID management, resource registration, and widget event handling. All functions perform straightforward data processing, string parsing, and resource path registration. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The external dependencies are standard for GUI applications and do not raise suspicion. The functions include validation and safe string manipulation, with no dynamic code execution or unsafe system calls detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign and serves standard GUI helper functionalities. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are apparent. It appears to be a legitimate part of a GUI application framework with no indicators of malware or supply chain threats.",
