{
  "purpose": "The code provides constants and utility functions for GUI layout, ID handling, resource registration, and widget property management, supporting application UI behavior and flow control.",
  "sources": "Filesystem paths for resource registration, widget attributes for IDs and flow states, regex validation for IDs, and configuration constants.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, code execution, or data leaks are present; functions manipulate local strings and filesystem paths only.",
  "flows": "ID generation functions validate and construct IDs; resource registration functions load local assets; widget property functions read widget attributes; validation prevents injection; no external data execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code employs standard validation, filesystem access, and string manipulation; no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions for GUI management, including layout calculations, ID validation and creation, resource registration, and widget property updates. It uses regex validation to prevent injection, loads local resources, and manages IDs and flow states safely. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behaviors are detected. The functions are straightforward, validated, and employ standard practices, indicating a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for GUI applications, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It employs validation and safe resource handling, posing minimal security risk.",
