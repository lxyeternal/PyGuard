  "purpose": "Helper functions and constants for GUI app layout, flow management, and resource registration.",
  "sources": "Imports (re, math, typing, ae.base, ae.paths, ae.i18n), constants, and functions handling string manipulation, flow id parsing, resource registration, and widget property management.",
  "sinks": "Functions that generate flow IDs, help IDs, and event kwargs; resource registration paths; widget property updates; and dynamic code evaluation points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external widget properties or input strings into functions that generate IDs or update kwargs, e.g., `widget_page_id`, `merge_popups_to_close`, `update_tap_kwargs`, which process or construct data used in GUI flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious network activity; functions for resource registration load local files, no network access. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution or eval present. The code is modular, with no hidden or malicious behaviors evident. Usage of regex and string manipulation appears safe and intended for valid flow/help ID processing.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines constants, resource registration functions, ID manipulation, and widget property management routines. No data is transmitted over networks, no suspicious or hidden backdoors are present. Functions like `register_package_images` and `register_package_sounds` dynamically load local resources. ID and help ID functions generate strings based on input, with validation via regex. Widget property update functions manage UI state and are consistent with typical GUI code. No code injection or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be safe utility code for GUI flow control and resource management, with no external network calls or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard utility functions for a GUI application, handling IDs, resource registration, and widget properties. There are no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. The code's design suggests it's for a desktop or local GUI environment, with no network activity or hidden backdoors. Overall, this code fragment is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
