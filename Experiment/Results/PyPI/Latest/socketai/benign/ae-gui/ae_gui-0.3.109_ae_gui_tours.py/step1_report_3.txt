{
  "purpose": "This code defines a base class for creating interactive app tours and specific tour implementations for onboarding and user preferences. It manages page flow, widget explanation, and layout setup during guided tours.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include class attributes like page_ids, page_data, matchers, and widget/page identifiers; data is read during layout setup, page navigation, and widget explanation functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effects could occur if untrusted input influences widget identification or flow control; however, no direct data sinks like network communication or file modification are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve loading page data (load_page_data), widget identification (setup_explained_widget), and flow control via navigation methods (next_page, prev_page, request_auto_page_switch). Widget matchers and page identifiers influence layout and explanation logic, but no external or malicious data flow is detected.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. Widget matching via try_eval and lambda functions appears to be legitimate dynamic widget identification. Usage of deep copies and delayed calls seems standard for UI workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured, framework-independent tour management system for an app, utilizing standard Python practices for class inheritance, delayed callbacks, and widget identification. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Dynamic evaluation of matchers via try_eval could be slightly risky if untrusted data influences these evaluations, but in this context, they are internally controlled. No security-critical vulnerabilities or malware patterns are identified. The code relies on application-specific widget and flow handling, which appears legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a guided tour system for an app with standard practices, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It functions as expected for a UI tour management system without any suspicious or harmful elements.",
