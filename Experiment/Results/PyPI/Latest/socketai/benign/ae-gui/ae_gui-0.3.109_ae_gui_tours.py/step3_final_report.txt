{
  "purpose": "The code manages an application tour system, handling page flow, explanations, and UI overlays, with dynamic evaluation of matchers and flow control.",
  "sources": "Class attributes, method parameters, external functions like try_eval, get_f_string, get_text, and widget lookups.",
  "sinks": "Widget lookups, change_flow, delayed method calls, and layout updates, with dynamic eval points potentially executing code.",
  "flows": "From page IDs and matchers (via try_eval) to widget explanation, flow actions, and UI updates, including delayed calls for flow control.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try_eval on matcher strings without strict validation, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured UI tour management system with dynamic evaluation practices. The use of try_eval introduces a potential injection risk if matcher strings are influenced externally. No malicious payloads, network activity, or backdoors are present. The deep copies of app states are standard but resource-intensive. The overall design is transparent and well-organized, with no obfuscation. The primary concern is the dynamic eval of matcher strings, which should be sanitized or replaced with safer evaluation methods to mitigate potential code injection risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured UI tour management system with no malicious intent. The main security concern is the use of eval-like evaluation of matcher strings, which could be exploited if inputs are compromised. Scores are consistent with this assessment, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a moderate security risk (~0.3) due to dynamic eval practices. Vigilance over external influences on matcher strings is recommended.",
