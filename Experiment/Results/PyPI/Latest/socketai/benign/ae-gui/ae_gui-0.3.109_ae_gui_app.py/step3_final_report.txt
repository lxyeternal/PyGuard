  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for a GUI application framework, managing app states, resources, UI interactions, themes, and events.",
  "sources": "Config files, widget attributes, user interactions, external resources (images, sounds, translations).",
  "sinks": "Dynamic method calls (call_method, class_by_name), resource loading functions, UI updates, popup handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from configs/user input into app states, resource selection, and event handling via dynamic invocation and resource functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic class lookup and method invocation; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, extensible GUI framework base class. Dynamic features like class_by_name and call_method are typical for plugin or extension systems. No signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious payloads are present. Resource loading and widget searches are standard. Risks associated with dynamic invocation depend on input validation, but in this context, they appear controlled and intended for framework extensibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard application framework component with no evidence of malicious activity. Dynamic invocation features are typical but should be used with proper input validation to prevent misuse. Overall security risk is low.",
