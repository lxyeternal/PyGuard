  "purpose": "The code is a test suite that verifies the presence and correctness of module attributes (__version__, __doc__) and the existence of a test folder.",
  "sources": "Reading module attributes (__version__, __doc__) and checking directory existence (TESTS_FOLDER).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Static attribute access and directory existence checks; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard dynamic import and attribute assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports a fixed module ('ae.gui') and performs simple attribute checks and directory existence verification. It does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data. The use of importlib.import_module with a hardcoded string is standard in testing contexts. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign and transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard testing script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
