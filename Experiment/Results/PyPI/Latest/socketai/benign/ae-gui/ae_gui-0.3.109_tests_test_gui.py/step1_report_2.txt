  "purpose": "The code performs integration and unit testing for a Python project module, verifying version, docstring, and tests folder existence.",
  "sources": "Import statements (importlib, os, and ae.base), reading module attributes (__version__, __doc__).",
  "sinks": "Assertions that verify the presence and type of module attributes, and directory existence check.",
  "flows": "Import of 'ae.gui' via importlib, reading __version__ and __doc__ attributes, asserting folder existence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses dynamic import but does not appear to perform any malicious actions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a module dynamically using importlib, then verifies certain attributes (__version__, __doc__) and the existence of a directory. All operations are standard testing procedures. No suspicious code, obfuscated logic, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward testing module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical validation tasks without any suspicious activity.",
