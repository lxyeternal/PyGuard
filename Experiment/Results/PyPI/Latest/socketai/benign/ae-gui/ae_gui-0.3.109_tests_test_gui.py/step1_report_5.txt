  "purpose": "The code is designed for testing and validating the existence of specific module attributes, documentation, and folder structure in a Python project.",
  "sources": "os.path.isdir(TESTS_FOLDER), importlib.import_module(main_imp_name), main_module.__version__, main_module.__doc__",
  "sinks": "Assertions on module attributes and folder existence do not pose security risks; no sinks for untrusted data or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code reads module attributes and folder info without passing untrusted data or executing external commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.import_module with a variable module name is generally safe here but could be misused if the variable is externally controlled. No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a module dynamically based on a hardcoded string, checks for version and docstring attributes, and verifies folder existence. All operations are read-only and standard for testing scripts. No suspicious data flows or malicious activity are evident. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign testing script with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs attribute and folder existence checks without executing external commands or handling untrusted inputs.",
