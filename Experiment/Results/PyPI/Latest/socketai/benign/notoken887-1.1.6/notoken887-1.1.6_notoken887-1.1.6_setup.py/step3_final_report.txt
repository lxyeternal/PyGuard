  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields such as name, version, author, description, url, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; potential concern with unprofessional contact info and URL as indicators of trustworthiness.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static metadata without dynamic input or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious email address ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org') are unprofessional and provocative but do not impact code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with static metadata. No dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious functions are present. The only notable anomalies are the unprofessional email and URL, which could suggest untrustworthiness but do not constitute malicious activity. The malware score is correctly 0, as no malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code. The security risk score is slightly elevated (around 0.2 to 0.4) due to metadata concerns but not indicative of active threats. The confidence level is high (around 0.9) in these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The package is benign and only contains static metadata with unprofessional contact details and URL. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to metadata professionalism rather than actual security threats.",
