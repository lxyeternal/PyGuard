  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the 'notoken887' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters such as name, version, packages, author, author_email, description, long_description, url, classifiers, and python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; no untrusted data processing or external communication within this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines package metadata and configuration without data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Author email contains a potentially inappropriate or unprofessional email address ('hitler@gmail.com'); the description states 'obfuscation test lib' but no actual obfuscation code is present. No other suspicious or malicious indicators detected.",
  "analysis": "This is a standard setup.py script using setuptools to package a Python library. The code only specifies metadata about the package, including name, version, author info, description, URL, and classifiers. The email address used is suspicious and unprofessional but does not impact code security directly. No code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. No external network activity or secret handling occurs.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent. The only concern is the unprofessional email address, which may indicate untrustworthiness or be a placeholder. Overall, no malicious code or security risks are detected.",
