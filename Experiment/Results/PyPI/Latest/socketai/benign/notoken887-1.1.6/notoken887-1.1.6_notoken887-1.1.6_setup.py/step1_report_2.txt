  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the 'notoken887' Python package, including metadata such as name, version, author, description, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Static data in the setup() call, including package metadata and package list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this static setup script.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or output; this is a static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of potentially suspicious email ('hitler@gmail.com') as author email, which may indicate malicious or unprofessional intent. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script with no dynamic execution or external data fetching. All fields are hardcoded, with the exception of metadata values. The email address is unusual and could be intended as a prank or malicious signaling. No code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. The package metadata itself does not exhibit any malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup configuration with an unusual email address that could be considered unprofessional or suspicious, but no malicious code or behavior is present. No malware or security risks identified based solely on this code.",
