  "purpose": "Define the package setup configuration for a Python library named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata such as package name, version, author info, description, URL, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted input or data; the code solely defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code is static configuration without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The author's email is 'hitler@gmail.com', which is suspicious due to the name associated with a notorious figure; however, this alone is not malicious. No other anomalies or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python library. It contains typical metadata fields. The author email is unusual and potentially inappropriate, but it does not indicate malicious code or behavior. No dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, or malicious functions are present. The content is straightforward and solely for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is standard and contains no malicious code or behavior. The suspicious email is likely a placeholder or joke but does not pose security risks. Overall, the package appears safe based on this code.",
