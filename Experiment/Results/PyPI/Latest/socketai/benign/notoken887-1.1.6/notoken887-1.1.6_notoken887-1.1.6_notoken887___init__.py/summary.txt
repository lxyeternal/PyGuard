  "conclusion": "The code generally appears safe with some reports indicating potential risks due to dynamic execution and obfuscation. The overall malware score is approximately 0.3, obfuscation around 0.4, and security risk near 0.4, reflecting moderate concern but no confirmed malicious activity. Further detailed analysis is recommended for code sections involving eval/exec and obfuscation to mitigate potential threats."
