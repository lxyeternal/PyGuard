  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on dynamic execution, obfuscation, data leaks, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input from environment variables, user inputs, files, network data, and system calls.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network connections, file writes, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources feeding into sinks via data flows, especially through eval/exec, network transmission, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, complex variable names, dynamic code, and suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate low suspicion with benign code, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risks (~0.2). Reports highlighting eval/exec, obfuscation, and network activity (notably report 5) suggest moderate concern, with malware scores around 0.3, obfuscation scores near 0.7, and security risks around 0.5. The presence of dynamic execution and obfuscation increases the potential for malicious exploitation, but no definitive malicious payloads are confirmed. The overall assessment balances observed behaviors with cautious suspicion, emphasizing the need for further static and dynamic analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code generally appears safe with some reports indicating potential risks due to dynamic execution and obfuscation. The overall malware score is approximately 0.3, obfuscation around 0.4, and security risk near 0.4, reflecting moderate concern but no confirmed malicious activity. Further detailed analysis is recommended for code sections involving eval/exec and obfuscation to mitigate potential threats.",
