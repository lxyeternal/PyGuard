  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific function within a larger Python application, possibly related to data processing or network communication. However, the exact intent is unclear without more context.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, files, or network sources (if present). Specific source points are not clearly visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writes, or system commands. The code may write or transmit data to external destinations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (environment variables, files, network) to sinks (network, files, system commands). Exact flow paths are unclear without detailed code lines.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures are evident. The code uses standard libraries and techniques. No malicious patterns such as obfuscated code or hidden backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed carefully at multiple points. No suspicious behaviors, such as network exfiltration, credential theft, or malicious system modifications, are apparent. Use of standard modules and absence of obscure code suggests low risk. Without specific code snippets, detailed analysis is limited.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose with no evident malware or security issues.",
