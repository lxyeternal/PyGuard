  "purpose": "The class provides simple reversible encoding and decoding (encryption/decryption) of tokens using a substitution table and string reversal.",
  "sources": "The 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods, which process input tokens provided by external callers.",
  "sinks": "The output of 'encrypt' and input to 'decrypt'; no data leaks or external communication is present.",
  "flows": "User-provided token -> 'encrypt' method applies substitution + reversal -> returns encoded string; encoded string -> 'decrypt' method reverses string + substitution -> original token.",
  "anomalies": "The encoding is a straightforward substitution cipher with string reversal, which is trivial to reverse; no hardcoded credentials, environment variables, or suspicious behaviors observed. No network operations, file access, or malicious code embedded.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a substitution cipher with a fixed table for both encryption and decryption, involving simple character replacement and string reversal. The methods are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or external interactions. There are no obfuscation techniques, no suspicious input handling, or malicious behaviors. The design appears to serve as an obfuscation or encoding mechanism rather than encryption, but nothing malicious is present. No signs of backdoors, data theft, or malicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a basic reversible encoding scheme without malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations, nor does it contain malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms. It is a simple obfuscation utility with no apparent security threat.",
