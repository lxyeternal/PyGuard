  "purpose": "This class provides methods to encrypt and decrypt tokens by substituting characters based on a replacement table and reversing the string.",
  "sources": "Input tokens for encryption or decryption via the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods.",
  "sinks": "Output of transformed tokens after encryption or decryption; no external data sinks or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input token -> substitution based on replacement table -> string reversal -> output; decryption reverses this process.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses character substitution and reversal but no suspicious code patterns, hidden backdoors, or obfuscated code. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or other malicious actions are evident.",
  "analysis": "The class defines a character mapping for encryption and decryption, with straightforward logic. The 'encrypt' method substitutes characters and reverses the string, then prefixes with 'ENC#'. The 'decrypt' method removes the prefix, reverses the string back, and substitutes characters to retrieve the original token. The implementation appears to be a simple obfuscation scheme without any malicious intent or malicious side-effects. No external data or network calls are involved. The code's purpose is to provide a reversible character substitution cipher, likely for obscuring tokens, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple reversible character substitution with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The implementation is straightforward and unlikely to be used maliciously.",
