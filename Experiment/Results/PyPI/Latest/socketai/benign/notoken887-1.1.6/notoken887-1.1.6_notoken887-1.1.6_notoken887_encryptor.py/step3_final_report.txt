  "purpose": "A reversible obfuscation utility that encodes tokens by character substitution and string reversal, with a fixed prefix 'ENC#'.",
  "sources": "Input token string to the encrypt() method.",
  "sinks": "Return value of encrypt() and input to decrypt() method.",
  "flows": "encrypt() substitutes characters, reverses string, adds prefix; decrypt() removes prefix, reverses string, substitutes back.",
  "anomalies": "No validation of the 'ENC#' prefix during decryption; static substitution tables; trivial cipher.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple substitution cipher combined with string reversal, which is easily reversible and provides no real security. No external data access, network activity, or malicious code is present. The static tables are comprehensive for alphanumeric and uppercase characters. The prefix 'ENC#' is used as an identifier but not validated during decryption, which could lead to malformed inputs but does not constitute malicious behavior. The cipher's simplicity indicates it is for obfuscation, not security. No signs of malware, backdoors, or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward reversible obfuscation utility with no malicious intent or activity. The security risk is negligible, and the obfuscation level is minimal. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: ~0.2, securityRisk: ~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
