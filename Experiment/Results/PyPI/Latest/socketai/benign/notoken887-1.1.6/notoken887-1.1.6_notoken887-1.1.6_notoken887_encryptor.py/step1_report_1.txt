{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods to encrypt and decrypt tokens by substituting characters with special symbols and reversing the string.",
  "sources": "The encrypt() method reads the input token; the decrypt() method reads the encrypted token.",
  "sinks": "The output of encrypt() and decrypt() are returned as strings; no external sinks or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "encrypt() transforms the input token through character substitution, reverses it, and adds a prefix; decrypt() removes the prefix, reverses the string, and restores original characters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual control flows are present. The character substitution table appears consistent and static.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward character substitution cipher with a fixed lookup table for encryption and its reverse for decryption. The methods do not perform any network operations, file I/O, or other potentially malicious activities. The use of reversible character mapping and string reversal is typical for simple obfuscation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code is self-contained, with no external dependencies or external data flows that could indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic reversible obfuscation utility using character substitution. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall design is simple and non-malicious.",
