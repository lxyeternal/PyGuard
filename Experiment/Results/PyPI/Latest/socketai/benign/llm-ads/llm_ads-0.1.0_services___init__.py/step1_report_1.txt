  "purpose": "The code imports a function named 'record_ad_impression' from a local module 'ad_analytics_service' and exposes it publicly.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from .ad_analytics_service import record_ad_impression'",
  "sinks": "None, as there are no untrusted data sinks or external outputs within this snippet",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports and exposes a function, with no data flow or processing shown",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import and export statements, no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function from a local module and exposes it via __all__, which is standard practice in Python for controlling module exports. No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior is present. The simplicity indicates no hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple interface to expose a function from a local module. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
