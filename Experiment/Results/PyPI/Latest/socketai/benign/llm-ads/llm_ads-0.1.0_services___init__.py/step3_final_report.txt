  "purpose": "Re-export the function 'record_ad_impression' from the local module 'ad_analytics_service' for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.ad_analytics_service' module",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external operations",
  "flows": "Import of 'record_ad_impression' -> exposure via '__all__'",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module re-export pattern, importing a function from a local module and exposing it via '__all__'. It contains no data flows, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. The code is standard and benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module re-export with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores reflect that. No further action or modification is necessary.",
