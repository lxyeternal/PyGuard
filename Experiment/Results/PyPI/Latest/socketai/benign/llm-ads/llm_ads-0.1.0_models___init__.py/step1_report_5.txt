{
  "purpose": "This code module appears to be exporting a class or object named 'Ad' for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'Ad' from a local module (.ad).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving user input or untrusted sources; the code only performs a straightforward import and export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no suspicious or unusual constructs. It only exports a symbol and imports a class.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Ad' from a local module and defines __all__ to specify public exports. There are no data processing, no input handling, and no security-sensitive operations. The simplicity indicates normal module export behavior with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical pattern for Python package modules to define exports.",
