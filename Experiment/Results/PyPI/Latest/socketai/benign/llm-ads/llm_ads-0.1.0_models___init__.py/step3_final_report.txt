  "purpose": "A minimal Python module that imports 'Ad' from a local module '.ad' and exposes it via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .ad module",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "None",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import and export pattern with no external inputs, data processing, network activity, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
