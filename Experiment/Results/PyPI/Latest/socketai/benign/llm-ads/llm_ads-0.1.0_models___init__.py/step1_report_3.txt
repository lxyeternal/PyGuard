{
  "purpose": "This code defines a module that imports the 'Ad' class from a relative module and explicitly exports it for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module '.ad' to import 'Ad'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The import statement flows from the local module '.ad' to the module's namespace. There are no further data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. The import from a local module is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class 'Ad' from a relative module and defines the __all__ list for module exports. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious code. The structure and format are typical for Python modules. No indicators of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard practice for Python packages to organize exports in this way.",
