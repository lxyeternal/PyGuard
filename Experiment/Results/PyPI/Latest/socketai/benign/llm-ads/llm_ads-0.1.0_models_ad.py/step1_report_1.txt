{
  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for storing advertisements in a database.",
  "sources": "Imports from sqlalchemy (columns and base class), class attribute definitions",
  "sinks": "Database table creation and ORM operations, but no direct data output or external system interaction",
  "flows": "Class attribute definitions mapped to database columns; no dynamic or untrusted data flow evident",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary SQLAlchemy components and defines a declarative base. It creates an 'Ad' class representing a database table 'ads' with columns for id, title, description, category, type, target_keywords, ctr, and is_active. Default values are provided for some columns, and data types appear appropriate. There are no signs of malicious code, external network calls, or unusual behavior. The code solely defines a data schema for ORM purposes, with no input/output or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward ORM model definition for ads, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It securely models data with standard practices.",
