  "purpose": "Define a database model for advertisements using SQLAlchemy ORM.",
  "sources": "Import statements for SQLAlchemy modules and the declaration of the 'Ad' class defining database columns.",
  "sinks": "Potential database interactions and ORM operations that could be invoked elsewhere; no direct sink in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Instantiation or manipulation of 'Ad' objects and interaction with the database may occur outside this code, but no explicit data flows are present here.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code. Usage of default mutable argument 'list' in 'target_keywords' may cause unintended shared state, but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a SQLAlchemy ORM model for an 'ads' table with typical fields like id, title, description, category, type, target_keywords, ctr, and is_active. The import statements are standard, and the class structure follows common ORM practices. The default value for 'target_keywords' uses 'list', which can lead to shared mutable default issues, but this is a known Python caveat rather than malicious behavior. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious data handling, or suspicious logic. No external input handling, network operations, or sensitive data handling is present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward SQLAlchemy ORM model defining an 'ads' table structure. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues in this code. The only minor concern is the use of a mutable default argument, which is a common Python pitfall but not malicious.",
