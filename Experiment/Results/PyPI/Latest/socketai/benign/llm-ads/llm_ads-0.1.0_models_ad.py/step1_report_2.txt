  "sources": "Import statements for SQLAlchemy modules and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; class definition does not process runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ARRAY(String) for target_keywords; default list for a SQLAlchemy column; no validation or sanitization of input data. No other anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports SQLAlchemy components and defines a declarative base. It then creates a class 'Ad' mapped to the 'ads' table with several columns. The 'target_keywords' column uses ARRAY(String) with a default of an empty list, which is a common pattern but could be problematic if mutable default is shared across instances (though SQLAlchemy handles defaults differently). The rest of the fields are straightforward and typical for such a data model. There are no signs of malicious code, external data leaks, backdoors, or suspicious logic. No input processing or external network interactions are present. Overall, this appears to be a standard ORM model definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SQLAlchemy ORM class definition for ads, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. The only minor concern is the use of a mutable default for the ARRAY column, which is a common pattern but worth attention in some contexts. No malware or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
