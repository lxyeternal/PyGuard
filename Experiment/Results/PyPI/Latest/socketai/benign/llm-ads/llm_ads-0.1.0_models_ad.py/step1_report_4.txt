  "purpose": "Define a database model for advertisements using SQLAlchemy ORM.",
  "sources": "Imports from sqlalchemy for defining columns and declarative base; class attributes for table columns.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data output or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization of ORM class, setting column properties, defaults, and data types.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of ARRAY type for 'target_keywords' is standard in some PostgreSQL setups.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules from SQLAlchemy, creates a declarative base, and defines an 'Ad' class representing an 'ads' table. It specifies various columns with appropriate data types and default values. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data flow is present. The code appears to be a straightforward ORM model with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SQLAlchemy ORM model defining an 'ads' table structure. It contains no malicious behavior, no backdoors, or suspicious patterns. It is safe for use within a larger application context.",
