  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for an advertisement database table.",
  "sources": "The code reads class and attribute definitions, SQLAlchemy imports, and data type specifications.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform external actions are present.",
  "flows": "Class definition and attribute assignments are static; there are no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. Usage of ARRAY for 'target_keywords' is standard but may require database support.",
  "analysis": "The code imports SQLAlchemy components, defines a base class, and creates a model 'Ad' with columns for id, title, description, category, type, target_keywords, ctr, and is_active. All fields are typical for a database model. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are found. The default values are standard. No input handling or external data sources are referenced. The code appears straightforward and standard for ORM model definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines a typical ORM model for advertisements without any signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is a standard database schema definition with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
