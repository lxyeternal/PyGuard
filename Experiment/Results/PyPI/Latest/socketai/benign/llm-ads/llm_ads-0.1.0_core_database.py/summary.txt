  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the use of default credentials, which should be replaced in production. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is zero. The code is a typical, secure setup for development purposes, with the caveat to override default credentials for deployment."
