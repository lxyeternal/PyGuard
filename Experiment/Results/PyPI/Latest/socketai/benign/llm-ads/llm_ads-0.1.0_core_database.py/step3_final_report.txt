  "purpose": "Setup for asynchronous SQLAlchemy database connection, loading configuration via environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (DATABASE_URL), os.getenv() fallback default URL.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Environment variable retrieval -> create_async_engine -> sessionmaker",
  "anomalies": "Use of default credentials ('postgres:postgres') in fallback URL, which is insecure for production but common in development.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup for an async SQLAlchemy engine, with environment variables managing configuration. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The only notable point is the fallback default credentials, which pose a security concern in production but are typical in development environments. No external communications, data exfiltration, or backdoors are detected. The code is clear, straightforward, and adheres to common practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the use of default credentials, which should be replaced in production. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is zero. The code is a typical, secure setup for development purposes, with the caveat to override default credentials for deployment.",
