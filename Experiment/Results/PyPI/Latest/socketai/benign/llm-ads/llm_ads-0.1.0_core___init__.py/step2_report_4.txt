  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report in detail:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module that imports two objects (`AsyncSessionLocal`, `engine`) from a local module `.database` and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- The code is minimal, with no input handling, data processing, network communication, or dynamic behaviors.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- Confidence scores are high (1 or close to 1), indicating the reviewers are certain about their benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. It simply re-exports imported objects.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident.\n- **Obfuscation or suspicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Malware activity:** None detected; scores are 0.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** Based on the code snippet, none are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, justified given the code's simplicity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Zero across all reports, appropriate for this benign code.\n\n### Any discrepancies?\n- Report 5 has a slightly lower confidence score (0.9) but still indicates high certainty. The reasoning remains valid.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a typical module export pattern, common in Python projects, and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThis code snippet is benign and standard for module exports.",
