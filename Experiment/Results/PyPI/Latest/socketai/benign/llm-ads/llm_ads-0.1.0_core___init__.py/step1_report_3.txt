  "purpose": "Exports database session and engine objects for external use, likely for database operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local 'database' module (AsyncSessionLocal, engine).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or user input in this code.",
  "flows": "Import from local module -> export via __all__ for external modules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or unusual code structures, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports database-related objects from a local module and defines what is publicly accessible. It does not include any data handling, user input, or other potentially malicious behavior. The content is straightforward and typical for a Python package exposing database interfaces.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module export statement with no malicious intent or security issues. It is safe based on this snippet.",
