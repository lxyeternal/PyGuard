{
  "purpose": "Exports database session and engine components for external use",
  "sources": "Import from local module '.database' which provides 'AsyncSessionLocal' and 'engine'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sink present; code only exports imported components",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; just re-exporting modules",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal and straightforward; no signs of obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific objects from a local module and defines an export list. There are no input handling, user data processing, or network operations. The code structure is simple and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs. It appears to be standard practice for module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module export statement with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It serves to expose database connection components for other parts of the application.",
