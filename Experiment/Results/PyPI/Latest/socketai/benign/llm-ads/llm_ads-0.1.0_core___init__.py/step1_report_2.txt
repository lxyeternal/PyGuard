{
  "purpose": "Exports database session and engine objects for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import from a local module named 'database' (relative import).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only importing and exporting variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of two objects from a local module and exposes them via __all__. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or hardcoded credentials. The code structure is typical for Python package modules, and the import is from a relative path, indicating local project code. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module that exports database components for use elsewhere in the project. No malicious activity or security risks are identified based on this snippet.",
