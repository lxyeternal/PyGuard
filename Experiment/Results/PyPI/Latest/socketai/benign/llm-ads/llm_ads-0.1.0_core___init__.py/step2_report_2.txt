  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- The code simply imports and re-exports components from a local module.  \n- No untrusted data, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Score justifications:**  \n  - malware: 0 (no malicious activity) — justified.  \n  - obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation) — justified.  \n  - securityRisk: 0 (no risks identified) — justified.  \n- **Overall:** The report is accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Same as above, straightforward import/export.  \n- No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 — justified.  \n  - obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n  - securityRisk: 0 — justified.  \n- **Overall:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Same pattern, no signs of malicious activity.  \n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 — justified.  \n  - obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n  - securityRisk: 0 — justified.  \n- **Overall:** Valid conclusion.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Same as previous; simple import/export.  \n- No signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 — justified.  \n  - obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n  - securityRisk: 0 — justified.  \n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Similar analysis; no suspicious patterns.  \n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still justified given the simplicity.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 — justified.  \n  - obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n  - securityRisk: 0 — justified.  \n- **Overall:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis, and no changes are necessary.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 across all reports.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I concur with the existing assessments. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard module export pattern with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.",
