{
  "purpose": "This code imports database connection objects and exposes them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .database module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only exposes imported objects",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports two objects, 'AsyncSessionLocal' and 'engine', from a local module named 'database'. It then explicitly defines these as publicly accessible via __all__. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious activity. The code appears to serve as a simple module export for database connection components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module that exposes database connection objects without any malicious or suspicious elements. It poses no security risks based on the provided snippet.",
