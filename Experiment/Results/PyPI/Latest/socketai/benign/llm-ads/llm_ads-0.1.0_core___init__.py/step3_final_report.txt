  "purpose": "This code imports database connection components from a local module and exposes them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .database module",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs",
  "flows": "Import from local module to module namespace",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export pattern",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing two objects and exposing them via __all__. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain hidden behaviors. The scores assigned by all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module for exporting database connection components. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are appropriate.",
