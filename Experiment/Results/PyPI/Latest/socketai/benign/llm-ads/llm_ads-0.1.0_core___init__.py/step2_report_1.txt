  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple module that imports two objects (`AsyncSessionLocal` and `engine`) from a local module `.database` and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- No report mentions any suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or unusual patterns.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for Python modules managing database connections.\n- The scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, aligning with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are zero, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the original code snippet.\n- There are no signs of code that process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain hidden behaviors.\n- The import source is a local module, not an external or untrusted source.\n- The code does not include any hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n- The reports' assessments are consistent and reasonable.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the absence of obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are 0 or very close to it, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for any higher risk scores:\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature of this code, higher scores are unwarranted.\n- No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable based on the code provided.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard module for exporting database connection components, with no malicious or suspicious elements. All scores and conclusions are appropriate.",
