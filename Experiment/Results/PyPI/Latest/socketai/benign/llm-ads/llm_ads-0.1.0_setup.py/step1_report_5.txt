  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'llm_ads' Python package, defining dependencies and metadata for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading package requirements from the 'install_requires' list; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only installs dependencies and defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard setup script with typical package dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with package metadata and dependencies. All dependencies are specified with version constraints. No code execution, user input handling, or untrusted data processing occurs. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The dependencies listed are common for web and async applications. The script appears to be a legitimate package setup with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup file with no malicious behavior detected. It only declares dependencies and package metadata, which is typical and safe.",
