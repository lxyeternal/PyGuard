{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package called 'llm_ads', including its dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The setup script reads data from the package configuration and dependency lists specified in the install_requires parameter.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present; the script does not execute untrusted input or perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code solely defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code. The dependencies are typical for a web application and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration script for a Python package. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and author info without executing any runtime logic or handling untrusted data. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code are present. The dependencies are common in web development environments and do not show signs of malicious intent. The script does not perform any file or network operations, nor does it include any obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply declares package information and dependencies for distribution.",
