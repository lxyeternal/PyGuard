  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package named 'llm_ads' with dependencies.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading input or data; setup parameters are static.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication is evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as there are no input or output operations involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script specifying package metadata and dependencies. It uses 'find_packages()' to automatically include subpackages. The dependencies are common and versioned appropriately. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The script lacks any runtime code execution beyond package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate, straightforward package setup file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
