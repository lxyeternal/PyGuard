  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for the 'llm_ads' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static package information such as name, version, author, description, and dependencies in the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed or output.",
  "flows": "None; the script is declarative and does not involve data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and uses standard practices without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for package configuration, importing setuptools functions and calling setup() with fixed metadata and dependencies. No runtime code, input handling, network operations, or dynamic execution is present. Dependencies are common packages used in web and async development. Multiple expert reviews confirm the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious intent are detected. The code's static and transparent structure further supports this conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or security concerns. All expert reports are accurate and consistent. The package can be considered safe for use.",
