  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for the Python package 'llm_ads', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata, including dependencies listed in 'install_requires'. No external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only declares package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic are present. All dependencies are standard and openly available, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata and dependencies with version constraints. No input reading beyond static data occurs, and no suspicious code behaviors are present. There are no indications of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply declares package information and dependencies in a typical manner.",
