  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'llm_ads' with its dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources or input reads in this setup script.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs; this is a setup configuration file.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed. The dependencies appear standard for a web API project.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with package info, dependencies, and description. All dependencies are common Python packages used for web development, database interaction, environment management, and logging. No code execution, data handling, or dynamic behavior present that could indicate malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors observed. The script is straightforward and standard for Python package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply specifies package info and dependencies.",
