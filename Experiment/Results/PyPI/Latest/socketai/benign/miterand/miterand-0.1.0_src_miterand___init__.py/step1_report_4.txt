{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define version information and imports modules related to tokenization, parsing, code generation, and interpretation, likely for a language or data processing tool.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ string and imports from relative modules: .tokenizer, .parser, .generator, .interpreter.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands that could be exploited with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only initializes a version string and imports modules without executing further logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns, are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and consists of a version declaration and import statements from local modules. There are no input handling, no execution of untrusted data, nor any suspicious operations. The module imports suggest a modular structure for a larger system, but this fragment itself does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module initialization file with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It merely sets a version string and imports modules for further processing.",
