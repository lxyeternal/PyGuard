  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a minimal module initializer: setting a version string and importing local modules.\n- No input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which is consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and evaluations:\n\n**Issue presence:**  \n- The code snippets are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.  \n- No data flows, no external inputs, no outputs, no suspicious code patterns.\n\n**Errors or flaws in reasoning:**  \n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.  \n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n**Scores review:**  \n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`.  \n- These are reasonable given the code content.\n\n**Risk score justification:**  \n- The highest risk score among reports is 0.5, but all are 0.  \n- Given the simplicity and benign nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Malware score justification:**  \n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, so malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n- No assumptions are made beyond the code shown; all reasoning is based on the code snippet.\n\n**Score consistency:**  \n- All scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on this review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical module initialization with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports are accurate in their benign assessment. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The current scoring reflects its benign nature accurately.",
