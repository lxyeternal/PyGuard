{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module initializer that imports classes or functions from local submodules, likely part of a larger project related to language processing or compilation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module version string and imports from local modules: tokenizer, parser, generator, interpreter.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks; no external network or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines imports and a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, consisting of a version declaration and local imports. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data is present. The structure suggests a standard Python package module init file, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module initializer with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
