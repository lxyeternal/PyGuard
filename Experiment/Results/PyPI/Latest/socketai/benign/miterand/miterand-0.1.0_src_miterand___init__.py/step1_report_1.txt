  "purpose": "Define the version and import core modules of a project, likely for processing or interpreting data.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading operations are present.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output operations are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The import statements are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports four modules: Tokenize, Parser, Generate, and interpret. There are no input/output operations, data handling, or dynamic code execution. All imported modules appear to be part of a larger project and are used for processing tasks, potentially related to parsing and interpreting data or code. The structure and syntax are standard. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module initialization with imports, showing no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign setup for a larger codebase.",
