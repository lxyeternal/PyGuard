  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple module initializer: setting a version string and importing local modules.\n- No input/output operations, network activity, dynamic code execution, or data flows involving untrusted sources are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n**Code correctness:**\n- The code is syntactically correct and performs straightforward imports and version declaration.\n- No errors or issues are evident in the code snippet.\n\n**Malicious behavior:**\n- No evidence of malicious activity. The code does not execute untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated/malicious patterns.\n- The imported modules are likely part of a larger project; nothing suspicious is indicated here.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities:**\n- The code itself does not handle data or execute logic that could be exploited.\n- The reports correctly identify the absence of such issues.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring review:\n\n**Malware score:**\n- All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- No reason to increase this score.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**\n- All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n\n**Security risk score:**\n- All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n**Risk score:**\n- All reports assign 0 or 0.5; they are consistent with the low risk profile.\n\n**However,** the report's conclusion about the absence of risks is accurate. Since the code is just a module initializer, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Scores are appropriate** across all reports.\n- **No adjustments needed** for malware, obfuscated, or security risk scores.\n- The reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis: the code is a benign, standard module initialization with no malicious or risky characteristics.",
