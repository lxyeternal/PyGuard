  "purpose": "Module initializer setting version and importing core components",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.tokenizer, .parser, .generator, .interpreter)",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; static imports only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script, defining a version string and importing modules. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. The structure is standard for a Python package's __init__.py or main module. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores should remain at zero.",
