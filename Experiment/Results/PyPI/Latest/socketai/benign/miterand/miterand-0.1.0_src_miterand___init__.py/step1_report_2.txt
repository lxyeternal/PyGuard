{
  "purpose": "Defines the version and imports core components of a module, likely for a language processing or compiler-related package.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; only local module imports from the same package.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows involving untrusted input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward version declaration and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a package version and imports four modules: tokenizer, parser, generator, and interpreter. All imports are from local package modules, not external or user input. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed. There are no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or data leaks present. The structure appears typical for a modular software package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard and appears to be a boilerplate setup for a package with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
