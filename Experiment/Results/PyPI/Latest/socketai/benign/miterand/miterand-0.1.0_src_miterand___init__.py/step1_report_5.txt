{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a part of a larger system involving tokenization, parsing, generation, and interpretation, likely for a language processor or compiler.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules: .tokenizer, .parser, .generator, .interpreter",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present in the provided code; no network, file, or system command execution observed",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and sets a version string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The version string is standard. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports four local modules, indicating a modular design typical for language processing or similar systems. The version string is standard and does not suggest malicious intent. There are no external inputs, no data flows, and no suspicious code constructs. The code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple module imports and version declaration, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate purposes.",
