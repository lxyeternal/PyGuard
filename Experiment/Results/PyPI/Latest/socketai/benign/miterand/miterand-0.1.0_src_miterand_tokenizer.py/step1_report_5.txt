  "purpose": "Tokenizes a given code string into a list of tokens based on predefined regex patterns.",
  "sources": "Input string parameter 'code' passed to the Tokenize function.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is sent elsewhere, stored insecurely, or used in a vulnerable manner.",
  "flows": "Input 'code' flows through regex matching to produce a list of tokens.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The token definitions are straightforward and standard for lexical analysis.",
  "analysis": "The function performs lexical analysis by defining regex patterns for various token types and applying them to the input string. It does not include external calls, network access, or data manipulation beyond tokenization. The use of regex is safe and standard. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. The code appears to be a simple tokenizer with no evident security risks or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward tokenizer implementation with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It is safe and serves a standard purpose of lexical analysis.",
