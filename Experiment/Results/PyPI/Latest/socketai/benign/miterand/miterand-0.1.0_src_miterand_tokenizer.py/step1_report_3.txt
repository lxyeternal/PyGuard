{
  "purpose": "The function 'Tokenize' performs lexical analysis on input code to generate tokens based on specified regex patterns.",
  "sources": "Input data is the string 'code' parameter passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include use of regex operations that could process untrusted input, but no direct data leak or harmful action is evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'code' is processed through regex matching to produce a list of tokens; no external data flow or output beyond token list occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code is a straightforward tokenizer with no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a regex-based tokenizer for a simplified language, matching tokens such as numbers, identifiers, and operators. It uses re.finditer to scan the input string and create tokens, skipping whitespace. No malicious code, obfuscation, or unusual behavior is present. The code performs standard tokenization without external calls or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, standard implementation of a tokenizer for a custom language or parser. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
