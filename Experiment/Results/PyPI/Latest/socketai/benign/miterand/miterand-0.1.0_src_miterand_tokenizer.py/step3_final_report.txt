{
  "purpose": "Tokenize input code into identifiable lexical tokens such as numbers, identifiers, operators, and delimiters.",
  "sources": "Regex patterns matching numbers, identifiers, assignment operators, parentheses, plus signs, dots, and whitespace.",
  "sinks": "Tokens are stored in a list; no external data sinks or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Input code is matched against regex patterns; matched tokens are appended to the tokens list.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of 'LAMBDA' token labeled as 'L' is unconventional but not malicious; no suspicious patterns or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward regex-based tokenization with no external calls, network activity, or data leaks. The regex patterns are simple and unlikely to cause ReDoS issues. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The 'LAMBDA' token is an unusual label but not indicative of malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard tokenizer with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and should remain at zero.",
