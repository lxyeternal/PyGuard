{
  "purpose": "The code generates a string representation of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for a simple language, including assignments, lambdas, binary operations, variables, numbers, and function calls.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading external input; uses class instances to generate code from AST nodes.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly writing or executing untrusted data; the function only generates string representations of AST nodes.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code merely constructs strings based on node types.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and focused on string generation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'Generate' function that recursively converts AST node objects into string code snippets. It handles various node types such as Assignment, Lambda, BinaryOp, Variable, Number, and Call, without performing any external input/output or execution. There are no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure is simple, and no unusual or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard AST-to-code string generator for a minimal language. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
