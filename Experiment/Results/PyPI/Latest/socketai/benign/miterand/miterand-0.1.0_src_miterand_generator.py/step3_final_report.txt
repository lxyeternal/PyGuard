  "purpose": "Convert AST nodes into their string representations for code serialization or debugging.",
  "sources": "AST nodes: Assignment, Lambda, BinaryOp, Variable, Number, Call",
  "sinks": "None directly; potential risk if generated code is evaluated elsewhere without sanitization",
  "flows": "AST node -> Generate function -> string output",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward recursive serializer converting AST nodes into code strings. It handles specific node types without performing external operations, network activity, or code evaluation. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The only external concern is if the generated code strings are evaluated insecurely elsewhere, which is outside this code's scope. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal (around 0.05), justified by potential misuse if the output is evaluated without sanitization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, simple AST-to-string converter with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The slight security risk reflects potential misuse if the generated code is evaluated insecurely outside this context.",
