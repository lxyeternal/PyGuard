{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a code generator that converts an abstract syntax tree (AST) into a string representation of code expressions.",
  "sources": "Input is the 'node' parameter which is an AST node from the imported parser module.",
  "sinks": "The function generates code as a string; potential sinks include executing or eval-ing the output string, but this code itself does not perform execution.",
  "flows": "Input node flows through recursive calls of Generate, constructing a string representation of the code based on node types.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is straightforward AST to string conversion.",
  "analysis": "The code recursively traverses AST nodes from the parser module, converting them into code snippets. There are no network operations, file operations, or data leaks. No suspicious patterns like dynamic code execution, system commands, or external data handling are present. The code serves as a formatter or serializer for an AST, which by itself does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a code generator from AST nodes to string representations. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
