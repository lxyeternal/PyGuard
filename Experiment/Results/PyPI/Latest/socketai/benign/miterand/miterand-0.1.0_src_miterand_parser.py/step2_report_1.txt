  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the code to evaluate the security implications, correctness, and scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a straightforward parser that converts token streams into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representing expressions, lambdas, assignments, etc.\n- No execution of code, system calls, network communication, or file I/O is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code does not process untrusted data in a way that would cause harm or facilitate malicious activity.\n- The parser handles nested lambdas, binary operations, and function calls in a standard manner.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is a standard parser with no malicious behavior. No issues are present in the code.\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a benign parser with no security risks.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. The parser does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports correctly avoid assuming vulnerabilities that are not present.\n\n- **Any inconsistencies?**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's nature. Minor variations in confidence levels (1, 0.95, 0.9) are acceptable given the subjective nature of confidence but do not impact the overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Adjustments to scores:**  \n  No adjustments needed; all scores are appropriate.\n\n- **Risk justification:**  \n  The risk scores are all 0, justified by the absence of malicious activity, external effects, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe parser with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign. The scores are reasonable, and no changes are necessary. The code poses no security risk, malware, or obfuscation concerns.",
