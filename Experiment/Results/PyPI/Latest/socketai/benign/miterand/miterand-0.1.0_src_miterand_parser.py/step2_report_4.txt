  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The parser reads tokens, constructs an AST, no malicious activity or security risks identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward, standard parser logic.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, code execution, or data leaks.\n- The parser only constructs data structures from tokens.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The scores seem appropriate.\n- The confidence is high, given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard parser, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Same reasoning applies.\n- No suspicious behaviors or external effects.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Scores are justified and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a straightforward parser with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Slightly less than perfect confidence, but still very high.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n- The parser's logic is standard.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard parser, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Consistent with the code analysis.\n- No external or malicious effects.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, no malicious activity, straightforward parser.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Slightly less confidence, but still reasonable.\n- No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely a parser with no code execution, network, or file operations.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All are at 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:** Given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features, I agree with the assigned scores (mostly 0, some 0.9/0.95 confidence). No adjustments needed.\n- **Confidence Levels:** Appropriately high, reflecting the clarity and safety of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports' assessments are accurate.\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code appears to be a benign, standard parser component.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's straightforward, safe design and implementation.",
