{
  "purpose": "This code implements a simple parser for a small expression language supporting variables, functions, lambdas, binary operations, and assignments.",
  "sources": "The code reads tokens from an input list provided during parser initialization; tokens are the primary input source.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output functions are present; the code does not send data externally or write to files/network directly.",
  "flows": "The parser consumes tokens (sources), processes them into an AST, but does not transmit or leak data externally.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The parser logic is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard recursive descent parser for a toy language, converting tokens into an abstract syntax tree (AST). It does not include any external data transmission, code execution, or malicious functions. No obfuscated language features or hidden behaviors are evident. The parser processes tokens locally, with no external communication or side effects, and no suspicious logic is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign parser implementation without malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It performs syntax parsing only and lacks any malicious or maliciously exploitable behavior.",
