{
  "purpose": "This code implements a parser for a small expression language that supports assignments, lambdas, binary operations, variables, numbers, and function calls.",
  "sources": "Tokens provided to the Parser constructor; input token stream from external source",
  "sinks": "None directly identified; no data is sent over network, written to files, or used in dangerous system calls within this code",
  "flows": "Token stream is parsed through multiple methods to produce an abstract syntax tree (AST); no external data flows into dangerous sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The parser processes tokens into an AST without malicious intent or obfuscation. No use of eval, exec, or system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several classes representing components of an expression language, such as Assignment, Lambda, BinaryOp, Variable, Number, and Call. The Parser class processes a token list into an AST, with methods for matching tokens, peeking ahead, and parsing different expressions. The parser handles assignments, lambda expressions, binary addition, and function applications. No external data, system calls, or network activities are present. The code appears to be a straightforward parser implementation with no malicious behavior. It is structured clearly, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard parser for a simple expression language. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely to parse token streams into an AST, with no external harmful actions.",
