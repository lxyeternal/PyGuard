{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class to spawn and interact with a subprocess running an interactive Python interpreter, enabling programmatic execution of Python code.",
  "sources": "Reads from subprocess.stdout during _read_until; writes to subprocess.stdin during run method.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to the subprocess's stdin, and output is read from stdout; no external data is sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input code sent via run() flows into subprocess.stdin; output from subprocess.stdout flows back to caller via _read_until().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code provides a basic subprocess interface with no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The class creates a subprocess running a Python interpreter, allows sending code to it, and reading output until the prompt appears. It includes safe subprocess handling with proper termination. No malicious or suspicious logic, no external network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. It is a standard implementation of a Python REPL automation tool. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign implementation of a Python subprocess interface. It does not contain malware or security risks. It appears to be a utility for interacting with a Python interpreter programmatically.",
