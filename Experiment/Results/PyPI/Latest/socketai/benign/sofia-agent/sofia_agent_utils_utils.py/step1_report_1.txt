  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for dynamically creating Pydantic BaseModel subclasses based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the create_base_model function, specifically the 'params' dictionary.",
  "targets": "The create_model function call, which generates a new Pydantic model class based on the provided fields.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'params' dictionary through the loop, constructing field definitions, into the create_model call to generate a model class.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of dynamic model creation is standard in some metaprogramming contexts but not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility to create Pydantic models dynamically based on input parameters, processing a dictionary of field configurations. It constructs field definitions with optional descriptions. The function relies on standard libraries and well-understood patterns. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are evident. The dynamic nature of model creation is typical in schema generation scenarios but should be used carefully with untrusted input; however, in this context, there is no evidence of malicious intent or dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function for dynamic Pydantic model creation with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
