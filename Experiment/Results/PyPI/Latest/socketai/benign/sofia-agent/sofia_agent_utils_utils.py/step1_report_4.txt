  "purpose": "Utility functions for creating Pydantic models dynamically based on provided parameters.",
  "sources": "Input data from the 'params' dictionary passed to create_base_model function.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is written out or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input 'params' → Loop processing → create_model call with generated fields.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional check 'if description is not None or description != \"\"' is redundant; could lead to logic issues, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper to dynamically create a Pydantic BaseModel subclass using provided parameters. It processes each field's type, default, and description, adding them to a fields dict for create_model. There are no input/output operations involving external systems or untrusted sources. The logic for handling 'description' is slightly flawed but not harmful. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for model creation with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward implementation with minor logical redundancy. No evidence of malware or security issues present.",
