{
  "purpose": "Provide logging utilities for the Sofia project with configurable log levels and enabling/disabling of logging.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SOFIA_LOG_LEVEL' and 'SOFIA_ENABLE_LOGGING' for configuration",
  "sinks": "Logger calls that output messages; these are generally safe unless messages contain sensitive data",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> LOG_LEVEL / ENABLE_LOGGING -> Conditional logging functions -> logger outputs",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No data leaks or malicious commands detected.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically sets logging behavior based on environment variables, which is standard practice. The logging functions respect the configuration settings and do not contain any malicious payloads. There are no obfuscated code patterns, code injections, or external network calls. The code does not handle sensitive data directly, and the use of 'loguru' is typical for logging purposes. Overall, the logic is straightforward and does not exhibit malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides configurable logging utilities without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It correctly uses environment variables to control behavior and employs standard logging practices. No malware or security issues are present.",
