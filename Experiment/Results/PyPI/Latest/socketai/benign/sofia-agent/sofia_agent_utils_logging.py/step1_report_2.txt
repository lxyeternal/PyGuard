  "purpose": "Provide logging utilities with configurable log levels and enabling/disabling logging based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SOFIA_LOG_LEVEL' and 'SOFIA_ENABLE_LOGGING' for configuration.",
  "targets": "Logging functions that output messages via loguru.logger.",
  "flows": "Environment variables set configuration; functions call logger methods based on the current log level and enable status.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; usage of environment variables for configuration is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables to determine log level and whether logging is enabled. It conditionally logs messages based on these settings. No untrusted input is directly processed; the environment variables are used solely for configuration. Logging functions are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or data leaks observed. The code adheres to standard logging utility practices, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging utility module that configures and outputs logs based on environment variables. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
