{
  "purpose": "Provide logging utilities with configurable log level and enable/disable option.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SOFIA_LOG_LEVEL' and 'SOFIA_ENABLE_LOGGING' for configuration; calls to logging functions with message strings.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs via loguru's logger, which may output to console or files depending on configuration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log level and logging enable flag; message inputs flow into logger functions which output logs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code constructs, no obfuscated code, and no external data handling apart from standard environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration from environment variables to determine logging behavior, then defines functions to log messages at different severity levels. No untrusted data sources are involved beyond standard environment variables, which are safely used to set configurations. The use of loguru is standard for logging purposes and does not introduce malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, with no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code. No suspicious or anomalous code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign logging utility module that securely handles configuration through environment variables. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears to serve its intended purpose without any security concerns.",
