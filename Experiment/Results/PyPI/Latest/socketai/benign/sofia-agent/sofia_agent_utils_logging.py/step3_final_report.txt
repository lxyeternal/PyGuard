  "purpose": "Provides configurable logging utilities using environment variables for log level and enable/disable flag.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SOFIA_LOG_LEVEL' and 'SOFIA_ENABLE_LOGGING' used for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Logging functions that output messages via loguru; no untrusted data sinks or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log level and enable flag; functions conditionally log messages based on these settings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard logging utility that reads configuration from environment variables and logs messages accordingly. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or external network calls are present. The environment variables are used for configuration, which is typical and safe in this context. The functions only perform logging based on the configuration, with no data leaks or malicious actions. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code and the minimal security impact of environment variable handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging utility with no malicious intent or security flaws. The environment variable usage and logging functions are typical and safe. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified, reflecting minimal security risk and no obfuscation or malware.",
