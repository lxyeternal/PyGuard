{
  "purpose": "Provides logging utilities using loguru, with configurable log levels and enabling/disabling based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables SOFIA_LOG_LEVEL and SOFIA_ENABLE_LOGGING for configuration; external calls to logging functions with message inputs.",
  "sinks": "Log outputs via loguru logger, which typically writes to console or files depending on configuration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence logging level and enabling; functions accept messages and log them according to configuration settings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Use of environment variables for configuration is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes logging configuration based on environment variables and defines wrapper functions for different log levels. It does not process or output untrusted data in a manner that would cause security issues. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present. The environment variable usage is typical and does not introduce risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging utility with configurable levels and enabling flags, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
