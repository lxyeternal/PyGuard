{
  "purpose": "Provide logging utilities with configurable log levels and enable/disable functionality.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SOFIA_LOG_LEVEL' and 'SOFIA_ENABLE_LOGGING' for configuration; input messages to logging functions.",
  "sinks": "The logging functions send messages to the loguru logger; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources in this code.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence the log level and enable flag; messages passed to logging functions are logged according to configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard environment variable handling and logging practices without unusual patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes logging settings based on environment variables, enabling dynamic configuration. Logging functions are conditionally executed based on these settings, and no external or untrusted data processing occurs outside of message logging. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. The use of environment variables for configuration is standard, and the logging level control is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign logging utility with configurable settings. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on this analysis.",
