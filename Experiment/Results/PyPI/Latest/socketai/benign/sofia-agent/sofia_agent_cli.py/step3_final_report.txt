  "purpose": "A CLI utility for generating configuration files and starter scripts for an AI agent framework (SOFIA), based on user input.",
  "sources": "User input via questionary prompts for directory, agent name, persona, LLM choice, steps, routes, and tool arguments.",
  "sinks": "Writing YAML configuration files and Python starter scripts to specified directory.",
  "flows": "User input flows into file content generation; no untrusted code execution or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward project scaffolding tool that collects user input to generate configuration and starter code files. It uses standard libraries and safe file operations. No malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity is present. The input is used solely for file creation, with minimal operational risk. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, purpose-specific utility for project setup. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident. The current scores accurately reflect its benign nature, and no further action is necessary.",
