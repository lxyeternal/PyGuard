{
  "purpose": "The script provides an interactive CLI to generate configuration files and starter code for a Sofia-based AI agent project.",
  "sources": "User inputs via questionary prompts for directory path, agent details, steps, routes, and tool argument descriptions.",
  "sinks": "File system writes for YAML config file and Python starter script; no untrusted data is used directly in security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "User input flows from prompts into data structures, then into YAML and Python files written to disk. No data flows into network or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior observed. The code is mainly straightforward configuration generation with user prompts.",
  "analysis": "The code collects user input interactively, constructs configuration data, and writes it to files. There are no dynamic code executions, network communications, or handling of untrusted data in security-sensitive contexts. The use of input data is confined to file writing operations, with no evident attempt to process or evaluate input data maliciously. It does not load or execute external code besides static template strings. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. Overall, the script appears to be a benign project scaffolding tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe and standard CLI script for generating configuration files for Sofia agents. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
