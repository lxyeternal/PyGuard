{
  "purpose": "This script is an interactive CLI tool designed to generate configuration files and starter Python scripts for creating AI agents with customizable steps, tools, and language models.",
  "sources": "User inputs via questionary prompts for directory paths, agent details, steps, routes, tool arguments, and LLM choices.",
  "sinks": "File system writes for YAML configuration and Python starter script; no untrusted data directly used in network, system, or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "User inputs flow from prompts to variables; variables are used to generate YAML and Python files. No untrusted data flows into system commands or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present. All operations are straightforward: input collection, file writing, and code generation.",
  "analysis": "The code collects configuration details via questionary prompts and writes the data into YAML and Python files for agent setup. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are detected. The code relies solely on user input and standard file I/O, with no malicious or malicious-sounding behavior. The only potential concern is the creation of files based on user input, but this is consistent with its purpose and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI tool for generating agent configuration files and starter scripts. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided code. It is a standard, purpose-specific script with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
