  "purpose": "This script provides an interactive CLI to generate configuration files and starter Python scripts for an AI agent project using the SOFIA framework.",
  "sources": "User input via questionary prompts, data from command line arguments",
  "sinks": "Writing YAML configuration files, writing Python script files",
  "flows": "User inputs -> Data stored in variables -> Files written to disk (YAML and Python scripts)",
  "anomalies": "None observed; prompts are standard for project configuration",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool for project scaffolding. It collects user input to generate configuration files and starter code. It reads no external or untrusted data at runtime other than user inputs, which are used solely for file creation. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are present. The code does not contain obfuscated or suspicious logic; it mainly generates files based on user prompts. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are detected. The code correctly uses standard libraries and safely writes files. Overall, there are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign project scaffolding tool that interactively generates configuration and starter code files for an AI agent framework. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
