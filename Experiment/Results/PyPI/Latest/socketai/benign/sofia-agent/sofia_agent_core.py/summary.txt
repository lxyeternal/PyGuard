  "conclusion": "The code is a typical flow management system with a significant security vulnerability due to pickle serialization. No malware or malicious intent is evident. The primary risk stems from pickle's inherent insecurity, which could be exploited if session files are manipulated. Scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are appropriate; a risk score of approximately 0.5 would better reflect the severity of pickle's vulnerability."
