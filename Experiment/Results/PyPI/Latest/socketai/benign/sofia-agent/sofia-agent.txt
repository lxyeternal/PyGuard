      "conclusion": "The script is a safe, purpose-specific utility for project setup. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident. The current scores accurately reflect its benign nature, and no further action is necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code is a typical flow management system with a significant security vulnerability due to pickle serialization. No malware or malicious intent is evident. The primary risk stems from pickle's inherent insecurity, which could be exploited if session files are manipulated. Scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are appropriate; a risk score of approximately 0.5 would better reflect the severity of pickle's vulnerability."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is appropriate given the external API interactions and non-standard model name, which is likely a configuration detail. No modifications are necessary."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign configuration class with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary concern is the handling of untrusted YAML files, which is a common consideration but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the code is safe for typical use cases."

      "conclusion": "The provided code is safe and benign. The incident reports lack content and do not demonstrate any malicious or security-compromising behavior. Scores should reflect a clean state, with malware, obfuscation, and risk scores set to zero. No evidence supports a supply chain security incident based on the available data."
