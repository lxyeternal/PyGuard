  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python code snippets for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on supply chain security.",
  "sources": "Constants defining system message and persona; no input or data reading points present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not process external input or output sensitive data.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; code only defines constants without execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, functions, or dependencies; only static string constants present; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is benign, consisting solely of constant string definitions for system message and persona. The incident reports are all marked as 'Empty response' with no additional content, indicating a lack of substantive data for analysis. No malicious code, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The absence of code execution, data handling, or external interactions suggests a very low security risk. The reports do not provide evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. Given the lack of actual code or responses, the malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and overall security risk 0. The empty responses are likely system errors or misconfigurations rather than indicators of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is safe and benign. The incident reports lack content and do not demonstrate any malicious or security-compromising behavior. Scores should reflect a clean state, with malware, obfuscation, and risk scores set to zero. No evidence supports a supply chain security incident based on the available data.",
