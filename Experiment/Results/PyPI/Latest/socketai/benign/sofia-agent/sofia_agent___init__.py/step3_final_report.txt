  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of eval()/exec(), external network connections, data input/output, environment variables, subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamic code, network data exfiltration, file modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., eval(), network requests) leading to potentially malicious actions (e.g., code execution, data transmission).",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() without sanitization, external network communication, obfuscation suspicion, hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in most reports, with scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0. For Report 3, the use of eval()/exec() and network activity justify higher malware (0.6) and risk (0.8) scores. Slight obfuscation (0.2) is noted but not confirmed. Other reports show no suspicious activity, aligning with their low scores. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors, with the exception of Report 3's obfuscation score which could be slightly increased to reflect suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk; Report 3 indicates moderate malicious potential due to unsafe dynamic code execution and network activity. Overall, the scores are appropriate, with minor adjustments to Report 3's obfuscation score for better accuracy.",
