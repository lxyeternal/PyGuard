{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization functions for machine learning models and clustering algorithms, including decision trees, confusion matrices, mesh grids, scatter plots, dendrograms, and clustering visualizations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data inputs via function parameters such as classifier objects, data arrays, and label arrays. It does not read from external files, network sources, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to files, send data over network, or execute system commands. Visualization functions output plots to the display without involving untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "There are no untrusted data flows or external data manipulations beyond function parameters, which are used internally for visualization purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The functions are standard visualization routines with typical parameter handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple visualization functions leveraging well-known libraries such as sklearn, seaborn, numpy, matplotlib, and scipy. These functions create plots based on provided data and model objects. There are no indications of malicious code, external data fetching, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or unsafe code constructs are observed. The use of standard libraries and straightforward function implementations suggests benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a collection of visualization utilities for machine learning and clustering models. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security vulnerabilities. The code is benign and safe for use in data analysis workflows.",
