  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only minor potential concern is the use of classifier.predict() in visualization, which is standard and not inherently risky. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting cautious acknowledgment of the classifier.predict() usage. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for deployment in data analysis workflows."
