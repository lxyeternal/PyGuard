  "purpose": "Visualization functions for machine learning models and clustering analysis, including decision boundaries, confusion matrices, dendrograms, and cluster plots.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as classifier objects, data arrays, and labels; no external data fetching or system commands.",
  "sinks": "Calls to classifier.predict() within visualization routines; no data exfiltration or external system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into visualization functions; classifier.predict() generates predictions for plotting; no external data or network activity involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Usage of classifier.predict() is standard for visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of visualization utilities relying on standard libraries and parameters. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The classifier.predict() call is used for plotting decision boundaries, which is typical and safe in this context. No external data sources or network activity are involved. The code is straightforward, readable, and adheres to best practices for visualization routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only minor potential concern is the use of classifier.predict() in visualization, which is standard and not inherently risky. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting cautious acknowledgment of the classifier.predict() usage. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for deployment in data analysis workflows.",
