{
  "purpose": "This code imports visualization classes related to machine learning models and clustering analysis from a local module.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'main' module in the same package, accessing specific visualizer classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks for untrusted data or external effects; the code only imports classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable as the code only performs static imports; no runtime data handling occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The import appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement from a local module, importing various visualizer classes used for data visualization. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No external data sources, network activity, or insecure operations are involved. The structure and syntax are standard Python, with no obfuscation or complex dynamic execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to import visualization classes for further use in a larger project. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is evident.",
