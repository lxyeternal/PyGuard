  "purpose": "Import visualization classes from a local module for use in data analysis or machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a relative module '.main'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only import statements are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement from a local module. It imports several visualization classes likely used for plotting or data analysis. There are no signs of malicious activities such as network access, data exfiltration, or code execution. The code is minimal, structured, and standard for a Python package or module. No anomalies, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign import statement used for importing visualization classes from a local module. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
