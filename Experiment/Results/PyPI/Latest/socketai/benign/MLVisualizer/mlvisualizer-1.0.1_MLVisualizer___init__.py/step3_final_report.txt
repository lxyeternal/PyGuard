  "purpose": "Import visualization classes from a local module for data analysis or visualization tasks.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module '.main'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are involved; the code only imports classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code performs static imports only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement importing multiple visualization classes from a local module. It does not execute any logic, handle data, or communicate externally. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
