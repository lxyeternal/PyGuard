  "purpose": "Import visualization classes for data analysis and machine learning model interpretation",
  "sources": "Import statement importing classes from a local module (.main)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed as this is a straightforward import statement",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, unusual language features, or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement that pulls multiple visualization classes from a relative module. It does not execute any logic, read inputs, or handle data directly. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activity. All imported classes appear to be related to data visualization, and the import path is typical for modular Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement used for organizing visualization tools within a project. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior.",
