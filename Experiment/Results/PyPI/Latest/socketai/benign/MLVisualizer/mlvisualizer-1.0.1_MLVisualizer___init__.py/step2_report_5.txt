  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine whether the issues identified are valid, consistent, and justified.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code in question is a simple, straightforward import statement importing multiple visualization classes from a local module `.main`.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, consistent with the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct given the simplicity of the code.\n- Security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and observations:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code is syntactically correct and does not execute any logic beyond importing classes.\n- **Potential issues:** No issues such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Malware concerns:** No evidence of malware or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Data flow:** Only static imports; no data flows from untrusted sources.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring justification:\n\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- Since the code is a benign import statement, no changes are necessary.\n- The reports are consistent with each other and accurately reflect the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a standard import statement with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports correctly identify this, and the scoring aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code poses no security concern.",
