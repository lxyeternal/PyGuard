  "purpose": "Import visualization classes from the local 'main' module for use in a larger application or script.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from the local module '.main'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs present; no untrusted data handling or external data flow.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only imports classes, no data flow or execution logic shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statement with no suspicious patterns or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple visualization classes from a relative module 'main'. There are no indications of malicious code, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The code does not execute any untrusted inputs, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data. It appears to be a standard import statement intended for a visualization module. No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or malicious behavior are detected based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement for visualization classes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
