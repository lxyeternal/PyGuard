  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'MLVisualizer', including metadata, dependencies, and project URLs.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' content for long_description",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is used or processed in a way that affects execution or security",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read 'README.md' without sanitization or validation is standard for setup scripts and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It reads a markdown file for long description, specifies dependencies, classifiers, and project URLs. All code performs straightforward package setup tasks. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity. Usage of 'open' is standard for setup scripts and does not introduce security issues in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup configuration script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
