  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup process for the MLVisualizer Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description, package requirements, and metadata from the setup() arguments.",
  "targets": "The setup process itself and the package installation mechanism; no direct data sink involved.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> setup() configuration -> package installation process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read 'README.md' without exception handling is common and not suspicious; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns observed; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging using setuptools. It reads the project description from a file, specifies package requirements, and sets metadata. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code performs typical setup tasks with no signs of malicious logic, backdoors, or data exfiltration. It adheres to standard practices without obfuscation or dynamic execution, and there are no anomalies in the structure or content.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate and standard for Python package distribution. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
