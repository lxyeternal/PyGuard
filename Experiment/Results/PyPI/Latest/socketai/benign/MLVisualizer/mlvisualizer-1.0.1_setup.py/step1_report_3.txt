  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of the MLVisualizer Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, description from README.md, and dependencies from install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted input or data; setup configuration is standard.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only static data and package metadata are used.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be standard package setup with no suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for packaging and calls setup() with standard arguments. It reads a README file for long description, specifies package dependencies, and includes typical package metadata. All inputs are static or from trusted sources. No code execution, network activity, or dynamic behavior is present that could be malicious. The structure and content align with common open-source Python package setup scripts. No suspicious code, obfuscated elements, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain any malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation. The package appears safe for use.",
