  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, dynamic behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks are identified.\n- The use of `open()` to read `README.md` is standard practice, with no exception handling issues or malicious implications.\n- The dependencies, metadata, and URLs are static and trusted.\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence level is 1 across all reports, indicating high certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n- **Code Content:** The code matches the original code snippet provided. It performs no dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling beyond reading a file.\n- **Potential Issues:** The only minor concern is the use of `open()` without exception handling, but this is common in setup scripts and not suspicious.\n- **Malicious Behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security Risks:** None detected.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations on Scores:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Remain at 0.0, as there's no indication of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Remain at 0.0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Remain at 0.0, since the script is a standard package setup with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nGiven the consistent findings across all reports, the code is a typical, benign `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence level supports this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analyses provided and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The scores are justified as low or zero, and no changes are necessary.",
