  "purpose": "A Python package setup script using setuptools to configure package metadata, dependencies, and URLs.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description; static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from hardcoded strings and files into package configuration; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open()' without exception handling is typical in setup scripts; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard 'setup.py' script for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file, specifies dependencies, and defines package metadata. No dynamic execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm the absence of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
