  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the Python package 'netcrackr', including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "User-provided data such as package name, version, author, description, URL, and long description from README.md",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no execution of untrusted data or external commands; no network connections or sensitive data handling",
  "flows": "N/A; setup configuration code does not process untrusted input or data flows",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard setup script with typical metadata and packaging instructions",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and configuration. It reads the README.md file for the long description, specifies package discovery, and defines a console script entry point. There are no dynamic code executions, external data processing, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate and standard setup configuration for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this script.",
