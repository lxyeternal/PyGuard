  "conclusion": "The setup script itself is benign and standard; however, the package's name and description strongly suggest malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, but the security risk score should be around 0.8 to reflect potential malicious use. Caution is advised before installation or distribution, and further review of actual package contents is recommended."
