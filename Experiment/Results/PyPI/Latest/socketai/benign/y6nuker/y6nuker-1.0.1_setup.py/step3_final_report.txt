{
  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata and dependencies for a Python package named 'y6nuker', purportedly a tool to 'nuke' Discord servers.",
  "sources": "Reads package name, version, author, description, and dependencies during setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present in this setup script.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script only registers package info.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'y6nuker' and description 'A Python Tool to Nuke Discord Servers' are highly suspicious and suggest malicious intent, despite the code being standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py with no malicious or obfuscated code. The suspicion arises solely from the package's name and description, which imply malicious activity. Malware scores should be zero, as no malicious code exists in this snippet. Security risk scores are high (~0.75-0.8) due to the potential misuse of the package if installed and run. Obfuscated score is zero, as the code is straightforward. The high risk score is justified by the intent indicated in metadata, not by code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script itself is benign and standard; however, the package's name and description strongly suggest malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, but the security risk score should be around 0.8 to reflect potential malicious use. Caution is advised before installation or distribution, and further review of actual package contents is recommended.",
