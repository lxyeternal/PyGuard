{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for managing build directories, resolving templates, handling environment variables, locating tools, and copying files within a build process.",
  "sources": "Filesystem operations (glob, stat), environment variables (os.environ), subprocess calls (run), file reads (json.load), and input parameters (templates).",
  "sinks": "Filesystem modifications (rmtree, copy2), environment variable settings, and eval() execution of templates.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (filesystem, environment variables, templates) pass through functions like resolve_template() and set_build_tool_environment(), potentially leading to filesystem changes or eval() execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() in resolve_template() introduces potential security risk if templates are untrusted; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build automation tasks, with filesystem cleanup, environment setup, and file copying. The only notable concern is the use of eval() for template resolution, which could be risky if input is untrusted. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and typical for build scripts, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified given the controlled context and the minor risk posed by eval().",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign build utility script with no malicious behavior. The only caution is the eval() usage, which should be reviewed if templates are sourced externally. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
