  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, correctness, and consistency of the scores.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a set of utility functions for build processes, involving directory cleanup, environment variable management, file copying, and executable location.\n- The code uses standard modules and practices; no network activity or suspicious system calls are evident.\n- The main concern is the use of `eval()` in `resolve_template()`, which could be risky if templates are untrusted. However, in a controlled build environment, this is generally acceptable.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malware signatures are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code appears correct and functional.\n- No issues are found that would suggest malicious intent or security vulnerabilities beyond the potential risk of `eval()`.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The primary concern is the use of `eval()` in `resolve_template()`. If the `template` input is untrusted, this could lead to code injection. However, the reports acknowledge this and consider it acceptable within a controlled build environment.\n- No other significant flaws are identified.\n\n### Score Review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0.2\n- These are reasonable given the code's nature.\n- The `securityRisk` score is slightly elevated due to the `eval()` usage, which is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- Malware score is 0 because there is no malicious code, network activity, or backdoors.\n- Obfuscated score is 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- Security risk is 0.2, acknowledging the `eval()` usage but considering the overall benign nature.\n\n### Additional Observations:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is standard build utility code.\n- No report overstates the risk; all recognize the potential danger of `eval()` but deem it acceptable here.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to `eval()`, but overall low risk)\n\n**In conclusion,** the code is a typical build utility script with no malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, and the overall security posture is sound. The only minor concern is the use of `eval()`, which should be documented or guarded if used with untrusted templates, but this is a common pattern in controlled build environments.",
