{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for managing build folders, resolving templates, handling environment variables, and setting up build tools for a Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (e.g., WOWOOL_STAGE, WOWOOL_LXWARE, WOWOOL_LINGWARE), file system paths, and project configuration files (project.json).",
  "sinks": "File operations (rmtree, copy2), environment variable modifications, and command execution via subprocess.run.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence path resolutions (e.g., get_stage_folder, get_stage_lxware_folder, get_lxcommon), which in turn determine file system operations and command executions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval in resolve_template, dynamic environment variable setting with run and exec, no explicit input validation for environment variables or file paths, but these are standard in build scripts. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs filesystem cleanup, environment setup, and file copying typical for build processes. The eval function is used to evaluate template strings, which can be risky if templates include untrusted input, but no such input sources are evident here. Environment variables are used to control paths, and commands are run to locate executables; these are standard build procedures. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or malicious code segments are present. The code does not include any obfuscated or hidden code patterns. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward build utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign build utility script with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or supply chain sabotage. It relies on environment variables and standard filesystem operations. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
