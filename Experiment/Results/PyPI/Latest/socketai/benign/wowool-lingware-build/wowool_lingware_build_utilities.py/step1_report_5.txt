  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing build directories, resolving templates, environment setup, and file operations related to a Python project build process.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (WOWOOL_STAGE, WOWOOL_LXWARE, WOWOOL_LINGWARE), file system (reading/writing files, existence checks), subprocess (which command), and input parameters (e.g., folder paths, package versions).",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls (run), file operations (copy2, rmtree), environment variable modifications, eval in resolve_template.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence directory resolution functions; subprocess run commands determine executable paths; eval executes templates that may incorporate external data; file operations (copy, delete) manipulate project files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval for template resolution is potentially unsafe if input templates are untrusted, but in typical build scripts, this is a controlled environment. No hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors. Use of subprocess to locate executables is standard. No suspicious URL or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build directory cleanup, environment setup, and file management operations. eval in resolve_template could be risky if templates are sourced from untrusted input, but likely intended for internal use. Subprocess calls to 'which' are safe in controlled environments. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code structure and usage are typical for build scripts, with no suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard build utility module with no malicious intent. The only slight concern is the use of eval, which is a potential security risk if templates are untrusted, but in the context of a build script, this is usually controlled. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
