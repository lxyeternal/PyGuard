  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom .unittest import run_test_folder, test_domains, test_lid\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code only performs a relative import of three functions from a local module named `unittest`.\n- No data processing, execution, or data flow is present.\n- The module `unittest` appears to be a local module, not the standard Python library.\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All describe the code as a straightforward import statement.\n- No suspicious behaviors, anomalies, or malicious activities are identified.\n- The only notable point is that the module name `unittest` shares its name with Python's standard testing library, which could cause confusion but is not inherently malicious.\n\n### Logical errors or issues:\n- No errors, flaws, or malicious code are present.\n- The import is standard practice in Python projects, especially for testing purposes.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet.\n\n### Scores:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, or security risk scores of 0 or very close to 0.\n- This is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- The only minor concern is the naming conflict with Python's built-in `unittest` module, which could cause confusion or import shadowing issues, but not security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n**0** — No malicious activity or intent detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n**0** — The code is clear and straightforward, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n**0** — No security risk evident.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is benign, likely part of a testing setup.\n- No changes needed in the scoring.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the analysis above.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a simple, harmless import statement with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The only potential confusion is the module name `unittest`, which is a common name and not inherently problematic.",
