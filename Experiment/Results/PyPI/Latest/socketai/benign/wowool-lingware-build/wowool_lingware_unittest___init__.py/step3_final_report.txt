  "purpose": "Import three functions from a local module named 'unittest'.",
  "sources": "Relative import from '.unittest' module, importing 'run_test_folder', 'test_domains', 'test_lid'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "Import statement does not create data flows; no execution or data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward import. The module name 'unittest' may cause namespace confusion but not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import of functions from a local module named 'unittest'. No data handling, execution, or malicious behavior is evident. The module name 'unittest' could potentially cause namespace conflicts with Python's standard library but does not pose security risks. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores. The code's simplicity and clarity support a high confidence that it is non-malicious. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard import from a local module. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; minor adjustments could be made to set the risk score to zero uniformly. Overall, the code is safe and non-malicious.",
