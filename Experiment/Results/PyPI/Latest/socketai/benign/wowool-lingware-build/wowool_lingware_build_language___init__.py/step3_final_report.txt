{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions and variables from a local module named 'build', likely related to language processing or management.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the local 'build' module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "The source (import) provides functions/variables to the current module; no data flows or external data handling are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement, which is standard in Python projects. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The 'build' module's content is unknown, but the import itself is benign. All reports correctly identify this as a benign, standard import with high confidence. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero; security risk is minimal. No evidence suggests malicious intent or vulnerabilities in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores are consistent with this assessment. The primary concern should be the trustworthiness of the 'build' module itself, but based solely on this snippet, it poses no threat.",
