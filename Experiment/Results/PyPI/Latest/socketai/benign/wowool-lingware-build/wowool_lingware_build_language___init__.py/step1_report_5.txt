  "purpose": "Importing functions and variables related to language processing and uploading from a local build module.",
  "sources": "Module import statement: 'from .build import make_language, package_languages, upload_languages, languages'.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, output, or external data transmission present in this line.",
  "flows": "No data flows; this is an import statement, not execution of data.",
  "anomalies": "Nothing unusual; standard import syntax with relative import. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import from a local module named 'build'. It imports specific functions and variables that are presumably related to language handling and uploading. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as code execution, network activity, or data leakage in this snippet. As an isolated line, it appears benign and standard for modular Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement, standard for modular Python projects, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
