  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward import statement from a local module named 'build'.\n- None of the reports identify anomalies, suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or signs of malicious activity.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1.0), indicating that the reviewers are quite certain about the benign nature of this code snippet.\n- Malware scores are all zero, with only one report suggesting a very minimal security risk (0.1), which is likely a conservative placeholder rather than an actual concern.\n- No reports suggest that the 'build' module itself is malicious; the concern is solely about this import line.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The code is a simple import statement. There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors directly visible.\n- The import does not involve untrusted data, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n### Scores review:\n- The scores assigned (malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk mostly 0) are reasonable given the evidence.\n- The one report's securityRisk score of 0.1 seems slightly arbitrary but not unreasonable, considering the module could potentially contain malicious code, but this cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since all evidence points to benign code, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n- The scores should reflect the actual security posture, which appears to be very low risk.\n\n### Malware score:\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0 in all reports, aligning with the analysis.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made; the assessments are cautious but justified.\n- No evidence suggests supply chain attacks or malicious code.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no indication of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk evident from this snippet)\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The actual security risk depends on the contents of the 'build' module. If that module contains malicious code, the risk would be higher, but this cannot be determined from this import statement alone.\n- The import statement itself is standard and benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided reports and the code snippet, **the code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation, and the security risk is negligible.** The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analyses provided.",
