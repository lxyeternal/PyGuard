  "purpose": "Import specific functions and variables from a local module named 'build' to be used in the current package or script.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module './build', importing make_language, package_languages, upload_languages, and languages.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks that process untrusted data or cause security effects in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable here as this is just an import statement; it imports functions/variables defined elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, only importing symbols. No signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports symbols from a relative module, indicating modular design. No data manipulation, network activity, or dynamic execution occurs here. The imported functions/variables could be used elsewhere for potentially sensitive operations, but nothing in this snippet suggests malicious intent. The structure is typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard import statement with no apparent malicious behavior or security issues. It appears benign and part of normal package structure.",
