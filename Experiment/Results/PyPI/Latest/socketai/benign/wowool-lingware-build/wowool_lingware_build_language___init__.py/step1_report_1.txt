{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions and variables from a local module named 'build'. Its purpose is likely related to managing or processing language data or packages.",
  "sources": "The source is the local module '.build' from which functions and variables are imported.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this snippet, as it only performs an import statement without any data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this code snippet; it simply imports symbols from a local module.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The import appears straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, importing four identifiers from a local module. There are no suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or security risks evident. It does not involve external data sources, user input, or untrusted data handling. The only potential concern could be if the module 'build' itself contains malicious code, but based solely on this snippet, there are no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign part of a Python project, assuming the local module is legitimate.",
