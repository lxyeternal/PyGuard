  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions and variables from a local module named 'build'. Its purpose appears to be related to managing language data, including creating, packaging, uploading, and listing languages.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module 'build' which is likely part of the package's internal codebase.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs are evident in this snippet; it only imports functions and variables.",
  "flows": "Not applicable as this is only an import statement; no data flow analysis can be conducted from a single import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious function names, or unusual code patterns are present. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, importing functions and variables related to language management from a local module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity. It does not perform any actions that could lead to security risks or data leaks by itself. Given the limited snippet, there are no signs of supply chain attacks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign and merely imports specific functions and variables from an internal module. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in this isolated code.",
