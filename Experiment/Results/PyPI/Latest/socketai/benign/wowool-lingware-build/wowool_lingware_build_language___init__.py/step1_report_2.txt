{
  "purpose": "This code imports functions and variables related to language processing, building, and uploading from a local module named 'build'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module 'build', specifically from the make_language, package_languages, upload_languages, and languages components.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in this snippet; it only imports functions and variables.",
  "flows": "Since this is an import statement, there are no data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains an import statement with relative module referencing; there are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward import statement importing multiple functions and variables from a local module. It does not execute any code or perform any data manipulation. As such, it poses no security risk or malicious behavior. The only potential concern could be if the 'build' module itself is malicious, but this cannot be assessed from this snippet alone. No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement that does not exhibit malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a standard part of a larger module setup. No immediate security concerns are evident from this snippet.",
