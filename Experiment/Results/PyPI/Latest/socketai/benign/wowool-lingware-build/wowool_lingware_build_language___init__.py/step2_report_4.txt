  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and compare it to the code snippet:\n\nOriginal Code:\n```python\nfrom .build import make_language, package_languages, upload_languages, languages\n```\n\n**Analysis of the code:**\n- It's a straightforward import statement.\n- It imports specific functions and variables from a local module named 'build'.\n- There are no data flows, no execution, and no apparent anomalies.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The code is typical for modular Python projects.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose, sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, analysis, conclusion all indicate benign intent.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues identified. The report correctly concludes this is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent reasoning.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious activity or security concern.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Slightly more detailed, mentioning the functions are related to language management.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (slightly elevated, but the reasoning is sound given the minimal code)\n- **Assessment:** The security risk score might be slightly high considering only an import statement. Unless the 'build' module is malicious (which cannot be assessed here), this should remain low. I would recommend lowering the security risk to 0, as the snippet alone doesn't suggest any security concern.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to previous, emphasizes that the code is benign.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also confirms the benign nature of the import.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on zero, which is appropriate given the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero across all reports, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Should be very low, given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The current scores are reasonable. The only point is Report 3's security risk of 0.1, which I believe should be lowered to 0, as there's no evidence of any security issue in this import statement alone.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all be close to zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n- The code is benign, standard, and does not pose security risks.\n- The scores should be:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence presented and the nature of the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always consider the context of the 'build' module itself, but based solely on this import statement, there's no malicious activity.",
