  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward string template for `setup.py` with no malicious logic, no code execution, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The high risk score appears to be based on the potential misuse of placeholders if external data is malicious. Since this is a static template, and no malicious activity is present, the high risk score seems unjustified.\n- **Recommendation:** Reduce the risk score to near zero, as the code itself is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a benign template with placeholders, no malicious code, and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The risk score is modest, reflecting potential concern if placeholders are misused, but the code itself is safe.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep the risk score low; it aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above—standard template, no malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign.\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a template with placeholders, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected.\n- **Recommendation:** No change.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar template, potential for injection if placeholders are maliciously populated, but no active malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The risk score is cautious but reasonable, given the potential for injection if external data is malicious.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malware activity. The code is a benign template.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** The higher scores (up to 0.9) seem inflated given the code's nature. These are templates meant for code generation, not executable logic.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward string templates.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Slight concern if external inputs are malicious, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign template for generating `setup.py` scripts. The high risk scores in some reports are not justified by the code itself. The main security concern would be if the placeholders are populated with malicious data, but that is outside the scope of this static analysis.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** Assign minimal risk and malware scores, emphasizing that the code is safe in isolation.",
