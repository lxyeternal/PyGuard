{
  "purpose": "Template for generating a Python setuptools setup script for a package related to Wowool NLP.",
  "sources": "Variables used within string formatting placeholders such as {PREFIX_DO_NOT_EDIT}, {wowool_module}, {eot_namespace}, {package_name}, {repo_version}, {setup_py_requirement}. These are intended to be replaced with actual values during code generation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code outputs a setup configuration script. No untrusted data is used directly in a manner that would lead to execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input variables are interpolated into the template string to produce a setup.py script. There are no dynamic evaluations or execution flows beyond string formatting.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string placeholders suggests this is a template rather than executable logic; no code execution, user input handling, or dynamic code evaluation occurs. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a template string for a Python setup script, with placeholders for project-specific variables. It imports setuptools, defines a list of packages, and calls setup() with metadata and configuration. There are no actual code execution, input reading, or data processing beyond string interpolation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template for generating a Python package setup script. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and poses no security risks. It appears to be intended for package build automation.",
