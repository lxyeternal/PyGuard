  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard template for generating setup scripts with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main security concern relates to how placeholders are populated during runtime, not the template itself. The malware score remains at 0, and the obfuscated score at 0. The security risk score should be low (around 0.1), acknowledging potential injection risks if external data is malicious. The assessments in the reports are consistent and accurate; no modifications are necessary."
