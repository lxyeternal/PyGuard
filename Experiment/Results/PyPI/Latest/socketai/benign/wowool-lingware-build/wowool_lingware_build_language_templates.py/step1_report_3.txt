  "purpose": "Generate a setup.py template for packaging a Python project, dynamically inserting project-specific details.",
  "sources": "Template string variables such as {wowool_module}, {eot_namespace}, {package_name}, {repo_version}, and {setup_py_requirement} that are meant to be replaced with actual values during code generation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or untrusted input. The code writes a formatted setup configuration, which is standard practice in packaging scripts.",
  "flows": "Template variables are substituted into the string to produce a complete setup.py script; no untrusted data flows at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs are present. The code is a straightforward string template for setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a string template for a Python setup script, with placeholders for variables to be filled in. It imports setuptools, which is standard for package setup. The structure is typical, with no code execution, no dynamic imports, or other suspicious behavior. The placeholders suggest it is part of a code generation process, not executing any dynamic or malicious code at runtime. No anomalies or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard template for generating a setup.py configuration file and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be intended for automating package setup with no hidden malicious intent.",
