  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version retrieval utility that performs its function without malicious intent. The only minor concern is the use of 'shell=True', which could be avoided for better security hygiene. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.2 due to the subprocess call. The code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."
