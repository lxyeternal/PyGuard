  "purpose": "Retrieve version information from a git repository, considering uncommitted changes, to generate a version string.",
  "sources": "The subprocess call executing 'git diff --stat --exit-code HEAD' to detect uncommitted changes.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess output processing, which influences the versioning logic based on change detection.",
  "flows": "The static git diff command output flows into the code that determines if there are uncommitted changes, affecting the version output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'shell=True' with a static command; no external input influences the command, but the pattern could be risky if inputs change.",
  "analysis": "The code executes a static shell command to check for uncommitted git changes, then processes the output to determine if changes exist, and constructs a version string accordingly. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The use of 'shell=True' is a minor security concern but is acceptable here due to the static command. The imported functions are assumed benign. Overall, the code is straightforward and safe, with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version retrieval utility that performs its function without malicious intent. The only minor concern is the use of 'shell=True', which could be avoided for better security hygiene. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.2 due to the subprocess call. The code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
