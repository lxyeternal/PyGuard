  "purpose": "Generate package setup and documentation files based on templates and JSON domain info.",
  "sources": "Reads local JSON files (*.dom_info), template files, and version info via get_version().",
  "sinks": "Writes setup.py, pyproject.toml, and README.md files; no untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Reads JSON domain info -> processes data -> fills templates -> writes configuration files.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a print statement for debugging; commented-out code is benign; no obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build and documentation generation tasks, reading local files, processing JSON data, and writing output files. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. Exception handling is appropriate. The print statement and commented code are benign artifacts. External functions like get_version() and resolve_template() are assumed safe. Overall, the script is a typical build utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; I recommend maintaining malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low risk score (~0.1-0.2). The overall assessment confirms the code's safety.",
