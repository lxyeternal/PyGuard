{
  "purpose": "The code generates setup.py and pyproject.toml files for packaging Python modules, along with processing domain info and a README.",
  "sources": "Input sources include 'package_folder', 'output_folder', and files read via glob ('*.dom_info') and 'get_version()'. Data is also read from JSON files and text files.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations ('write_text', 'write') to generate configuration files, and reading from files. No data sinks directly connected to untrusted sources are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (JSON, text), through processing and string formatting via 'resolve_template', into file outputs. 'get_version()' provides version info used in templates.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'resolve_template' suggests dynamic content generation, but the code appears to use templating for configuration files. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures. The 'print' statement for 'dom_info' is a debugging artifact but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code reads JSON domain info files, processes template variables, and writes configuration files (setup.py, pyproject.toml, README.md). 'get_version()' is used to obtain version info. The 'resolve_template' function generates content dynamically. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network calls, or malicious file manipulations are present. The print statement is likely for debugging and not malicious. The code does not contain any clear backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. Its purpose appears legitimate, related to packaging and documentation generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical build script for packaging Python projects with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It reads and writes files, processes templates, and handles domain info for documentation. There are no indications of malware or security risks.",
