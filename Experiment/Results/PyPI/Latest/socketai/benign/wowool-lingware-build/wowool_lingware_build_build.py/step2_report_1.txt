  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code primarily reads local files, processes JSON data, uses templates, and writes configuration files.\n- No network activity, code execution, or obfuscated/malicious code is evident.\n- Exception handling is present, mainly to prevent crashes during file operations.\n- The only minor concern is the commented-out code and the print statement, which are benign in this context.\n- The get_version() function is external; assuming it is a standard version retrieval function, it appears safe.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Claim:** No malicious activity, straightforward build script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The low malware and risk scores are appropriate. The high confidence is justified.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Claim:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious behavior, just processing templates and JSON.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly reflects the benign nature.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Claim:** Standard package generator, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The very low risk score aligns with the benign analysis.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are suitable.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Claim:** Same as above, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's purpose.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable scores.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Claim:** Similar, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2), which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9), justified by the straightforward, well-understood code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, matching the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain low, around 0.1–0.2.\n- **Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:** \n\n**Proposed estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.15 (average of all reports' scores)\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The use of `resolve_template` is standard for templating.\n- The `print(\"dom_info----->>>>>>\", dom_info)` line is a debugging statement but not malicious.\n- The commented-out code does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n- JSON files are read locally, and no external network calls are made.\n- The `get_version()` function's safety depends on its implementation, but assuming standard behavior, it's safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code. No modifications are necessary. The code appears to be a typical build utility with no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.15\n\nThis aligns with the overall benign assessment.",
