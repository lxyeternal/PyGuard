  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and considering the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code primarily reads version info, JSON domain files, and templates, then writes configuration files and documentation.\n- No network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code is present.\n- Exception handling is in place for file operations.\n- The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns.\n- Commented-out code appears benign or incomplete but not malicious.\n- The only minor concern is the `print` statement in the second report, which is a debugging artifact, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious activity, straightforward build script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues found. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious behavior, just a build script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the print statement is a debugging artifact, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard packaging script with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; the very low risk score reflects the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard package generation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Justification & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, mostly due to the benign nature of file operations and no external network activity.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9), justified by the straightforward analysis.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n\n- The risk score could be marginally increased to 0.3 if considering the use of `resolve_template`, which involves dynamic content generation. However, since it's based on templates and no code injection is evident, 0.2 remains reasonable.\n- The malware score should stay at 0; no evidence suggests malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 to 0.3 (keeping conservative at 0.2)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears entirely benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The reports are consistent with this assessment.",
