  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build and packaging script with potential security risks stemming from the use of shell=True and lack of input validation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to command execution practices, but the code does not exhibit malicious intent."
