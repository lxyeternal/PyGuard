{
  "purpose": "This script automates build, package, upload, clean, and test tasks for a Python project using Invoke. It manages filesystem operations, subprocess calls, and module imports to facilitate project workflows.",
  "sources": "Filesystem operations (e.g., Path manipulations, rmtree), subprocess call to 'python -m build --wheel', dynamic imports from internal modules, environment variables are not directly used.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution of static command ('python -m build --wheel') with shell=True, filesystem modifications, module imports.",
  "flows": "Source: static command string in subprocess; Sink: subprocess run with shell=True; Flow: controlled command execution during build process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of shell=True in subprocess with static command; no external or untrusted input influences command execution; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward build automation script utilizing Invoke. It performs filesystem operations, dynamic module imports, and subprocess calls. The subprocess command is static and controlled, reducing risk. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The only minor concern is the use of shell=True, which is acceptable here because the command is static and not influenced by external input. No external data flows or suspicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured build automation script with no malicious intent or activity. The use of subprocess with shell=True is controlled and does not introduce significant risk. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the code's behavior.",
