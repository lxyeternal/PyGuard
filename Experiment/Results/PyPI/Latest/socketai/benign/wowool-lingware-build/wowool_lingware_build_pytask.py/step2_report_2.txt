  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The script automates build, package, upload, clean, and test tasks using Invoke, importing standard and internal modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Mainly filesystem operations, subprocess calls (notably 'python -m build --wheel'), and dynamic module imports.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `shell=True` in subprocess, but command is static and controlled.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The subprocess command is static and safe in this context.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low), Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing build and deployment workflows.\n- No suspicious external data flows or malicious code.\n- Use of subprocess with `shell=True` is noted but appears safe.\n- Scores are consistent with the above, all indicating low risk and no malware.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on build, package, upload, clean, and test tasks.\n- Similar findings: no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, subprocess commands are static.\n- Use of `shell=True` is present but controlled.\n- Scores are consistent, indicating low security risk and no malware.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, a build automation script with similar structure.\n- No evidence of malicious activity; subprocess commands are static.\n- No suspicious external input handling.\n- Scores align with previous reports: low malware, obfuscated, and risk scores.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar assessment: build/deploy tasks, controlled subprocess commands, internal module imports.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- Slight concern about `shell=True`, but command strings are static and controlled.\n- Scores are consistent with the other reports.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is a standard build automation script.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk level:** Very low; the only minor concern is the use of `shell=True` in subprocess calls, but given the static command strings, this is not a security issue here.\n- **Scores justification:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and risk scores of 0.2, which is reasonable given the controlled environment.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (appropriate, considering the `shell=True` but controlled commands)\n\n**Overall, the code is safe and intended for project automation.**",
