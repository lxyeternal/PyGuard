{
  "purpose": "Templates for generating setup configuration files and README documentation for a Python package related to Wowool NLP tools.",
  "sources": "String templates containing package metadata, file path operations (Path), and package data definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks such as network communication, file writing, or execution of untrusted code are present.",
  "flows": "Templates are filled with variables (e.g., {package_name}, {repo_version}, {domains}) which are likely substituted externally, no direct data flow from untrusted sources within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no embedded malicious logic, and no obfuscated code. Use of standard library modules (pathlib, setuptools) is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string templates for configuration and documentation files used in packaging Python modules. These templates are static and designed for external substitution of variables. There are no input sources that could introduce malicious data, nor are there any sinks or flows that could cause harm. The code does not perform any runtime operations or data processing beyond defining static strings.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is safe, benign, and intended for packaging workflows. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, nor does it pose any security risks. It appears to be standard boilerplate code for generating package configuration files.",
