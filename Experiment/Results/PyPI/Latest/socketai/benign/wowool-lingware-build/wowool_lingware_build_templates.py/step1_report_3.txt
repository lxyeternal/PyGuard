  "purpose": "Templates for generating setup and project configuration files for a Python package related to 'Wowool NLP'.",
  "sources": "Template string variables containing package setup instructions, package metadata, and README content.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are evident; the code primarily defines static templates.",
  "flows": "N/A, as these are static template definitions with placeholders; no dynamic data flow execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholders ({...}) suggests this code is for template generation. No embedded code execution, input handling, or dynamic evaluation detected. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides string templates for package setup (setup.py and pyproject.toml) and README documentation, with placeholders for variables like package name, version, language, domains, etc. There is no logic to execute or handle untrusted input, nor any network, file, or environment variable operations. It appears to be boilerplate template code for package distribution. No suspicious behaviors, malware patterns, or security risks are present in the static templates. Since the code is purely definitional with placeholders, the risk of malicious activity is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code consists solely of template strings used for generating package configuration and documentation files. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. The code is benign and serves as boilerplate template content.",
