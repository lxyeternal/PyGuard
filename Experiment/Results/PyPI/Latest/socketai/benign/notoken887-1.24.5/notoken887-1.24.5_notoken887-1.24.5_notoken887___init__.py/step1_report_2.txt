{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python module intended for data processing or utility functions, but the exact purpose is unclear due to lack of comments and context.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are likely read from function arguments, environment variables, or external files (not explicitly shown). No explicit input sources are identified in the visible code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, file operations, or data outputs, but none are explicitly demonstrated in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow paths are not clearly demonstrated; the code mainly consists of function definitions and control flow without evident source-to-sink data paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are apparent. The code does not contain obfuscated code or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily composed of standard function definitions, control structures, and possibly utility logic. There are no evident malicious behaviors such as network activity, system manipulation, or data exfiltration. No signs of obfuscation or code injection are observed. The lack of explicit data input/output operations limits the detection of malicious flows. Overall, the code appears benign based on the visible content.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard application code or library functions without any malicious intent or suspicious anomalies.",
