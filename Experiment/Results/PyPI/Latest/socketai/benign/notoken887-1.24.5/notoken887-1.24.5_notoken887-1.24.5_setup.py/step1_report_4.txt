  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Data is read from static strings and package metadata within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or hidden behaviors observed. The package metadata includes suspicious contact info and URL but no malicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with static parameters defining package info, author details, description, and classifiers. No user input, external data, or code execution occurs. The author email 'hitler@gmail.com' and URL 'https://thugging.org' are unusual but not malicious by code behavior standards. No hardcoded secrets, malicious scripts, or obfuscated code are present. Overall, the code is standard for a package setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The primary concern is the questionable contact info and URL, which are not technically malicious but could be inappropriate or suspicious in context.",
