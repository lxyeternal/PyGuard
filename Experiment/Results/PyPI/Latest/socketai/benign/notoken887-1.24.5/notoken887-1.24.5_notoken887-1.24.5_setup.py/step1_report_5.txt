  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging setup for the 'notoken887' Python library.",
  "sources": "User input via setup parameters (name, version, author, email, description, URL). No external data sources or dynamic input handling present.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data leaks, code execution, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "N/A; the setup script is static and only defines package metadata without data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of suspicious email address ('hitler@gmail.com') and a URL ('https://thugging.org') that appears malicious or untrustworthy. The description and author info are benign but the contact info and URL raise suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration using setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, no input/output handling, and no suspicious code behavior. The only notable anomalies are the choice of email and URL, which may be intentionally malicious or provocative but do not constitute code-level malicious behavior. The setup parameters are straightforward, with no obfuscated code or unusual constructs. The package itself appears benign in structure, but the provided metadata raises suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious code or behaviors. However, the use of potentially malicious contact information and URL suggests potential malicious intent or at least untrustworthy content at the metadata level. No technical malicious behaviors such as code injection or backdoors are present.",
