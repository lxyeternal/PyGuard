{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods to encode and decode strings using character replacements, effectively serving as a simple substitution cipher.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings to be encrypted or decrypted via method parameters: 'string' in 'encrypt' and 'encrypted_token' in 'decrypt'.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs encrypted or decrypted strings; no external data sources or data leaks are directly involved.",
  "flows": "Input string -> 'encrypt' method -> character replacement -> output; Encrypted string -> 'decrypt' method -> reverse character replacement -> output.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses straightforward replacement without any obfuscation, dynamic execution, or external data fetching. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The implementation is a simple substitution cipher with hardcoded character mappings for encryption and decryption. It does not involve external inputs beyond parameters, nor does it interact with files, network, or environment variables. The code structure is straightforward, with direct replacements. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware functionality are evident. The only notable aspect is the use of character replacement as a form of obfuscation, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a basic character substitution cipher for string encoding and decoding. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be intended for simple obfuscation purposes, with no evidence of harmful activities or security vulnerabilities.",
