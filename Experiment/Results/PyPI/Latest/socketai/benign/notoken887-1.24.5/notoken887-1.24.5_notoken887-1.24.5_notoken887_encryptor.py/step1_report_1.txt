{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple substitution encryption and decryption of strings using emojis for characters.",
  "sources": "Input data is expected to be strings passed to encrypt() or decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "The methods return transformed strings; no external sinks or data leaks are present within this code.",
  "flows": "Input string → replace characters with emojis in encrypt() → output encrypted string; encrypted string → replace emojis with characters in decrypt() → output original string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No external network calls or system modifications. Replaces only characters with emojis; the implementation appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs character substitution for encryption and decryption, mapping alphanumeric characters and period to emojis. The replace() chain is extensive but standard, with no dynamic execution or obfuscation. The methods are simple and reversible. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security issues. The code's functionality is limited to character transformation with no side effects or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a straightforward substitution cipher using emojis for characters. It does not contain malware, malicious intent, or security risks. The implementation is transparent, with no obfuscation or suspicious behavior detected.",
