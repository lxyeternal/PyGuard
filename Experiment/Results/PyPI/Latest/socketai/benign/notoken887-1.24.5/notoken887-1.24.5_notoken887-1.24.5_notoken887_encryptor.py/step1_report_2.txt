{
  "purpose": "The class TokenCryptor provides simple substitution-based encryption and decryption methods for obfuscating strings using emojis and symbols.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from method parameters 'string' and 'encrypted_token' passed to encrypt() and decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs transformed strings; no external sinks such as network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed through sequential replacements, creating a source-to-sink flow where data is converted into emoji-based obfuscation and then reverted.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code solely performs string replacements for encoding and decoding.",
  "analysis": "The code employs straightforward string replacement functions to encode and decode text by substituting characters with emojis and symbols. It does not involve external data sources, network calls, or hidden behaviors. The methods are symmetric, with each replacing emojis back to original characters and vice versa. There are no signs of obfuscation beyond simple substitution, nor any malicious operations like data exfiltration, code execution, or backdoor mechanisms. Overall, the implementation appears to serve as an encoding tool rather than malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign character substitution cipher based on emojis. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose seems to be obfuscation or playful encoding, with no evident security concerns.",
