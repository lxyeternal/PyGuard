{
  "purpose": "This class provides simple character-based encoding and decoding functions to transform input strings into a sequence of emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "The encrypt() and decrypt() methods take input strings; no other data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The methods return transformed strings; no external sinks such as network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace() calls in encrypt() -> output string; reverse in decrypt() -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, performing character replacements without involving external data or complex logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code solely performs character substitutions for encoding and decoding using predefined mappings. The replace() functions are used in sequence, with no external data handling, network activity, or code injection mechanisms. The purpose appears to be simple obfuscation or encoding of text into emojis. There are no suspicious or malicious operations, and the implementation is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign encoding/decoding utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations or access external resources.",
