  "purpose": "Simple script that imports unused modules and prints 1337, with comments about self-addition.",
  "sources": "No external data read; no input sources; only the script's own code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processing or transmission.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "Unused imports (`sys`, `os`), comment about self-addition that is not implemented, no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, benign, and contains no malicious behavior. The unused imports and comments are harmless and do not indicate malicious intent. No data flows or suspicious activities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate, though the slight risk score can be lowered to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The comments are only speculative, and the unused imports are harmless. The overall security risk and malware scores should be set to 0, reflecting the harmless nature of this script.",
