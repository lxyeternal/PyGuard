{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that prints the number 1337, with a comment suggesting an intent for self-addition functionality.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading sources; no external data or user input involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only outputs a static value.",
  "anomalies": "The comment mentions self-adding behavior, but no code implementing such functionality is present. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and os modules but does not utilize them. It prints a static integer value. The comment hints at a potential feature, but it is not implemented. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no complex logic or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The mention of self-adding functionality is unimplemented and does not pose any threat.",
