{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that prints a number to the console. The comment suggests an intention for the module to self-add itself in some context, but no actual self-addition or modification logic is present.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform potentially dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the script merely prints a static number.",
  "anomalies": "The comment about self-adding itself suggests a possible intent to modify or manipulate the environment, but no such logic exists. The code itself is minimal and does not perform any suspicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries sys and os but does not use them. It contains a print statement outputting 1337. The comment hints at a potential self-modification feature, but no implementation is present. The overall code is benign, simple, and does not include any malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is harmless with no malicious behavior or security risks. The minimal implementation and lack of actual self-addition logic indicate no malicious intent.",
