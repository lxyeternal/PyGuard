{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be for debugging or informational purposes, printing a number.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the environment via the imported modules sys and os, but does not explicitly read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not output untrusted data or perform actions based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; the code simply imports modules and prints a static number.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of imported modules sys and os with no subsequent usage is unusual but not suspicious. No code is present that modifies the environment or reads external data. The comment suggests potential self-modification, but no such code exists.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and os modules but does not utilize them. It prints the number 1337. The comment implies the intention of self-adding functionality, but no such logic is present. No malicious patterns or suspicious behaviors are observed. The script is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is likely a placeholder or debugging statement with no harmful behavior.",
