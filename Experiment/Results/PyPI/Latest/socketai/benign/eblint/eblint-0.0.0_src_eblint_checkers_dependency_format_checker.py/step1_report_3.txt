{
  "purpose": "This code is a static analysis tool designed to check the formatting of dependency specifications in Python code, specifically targeting package names and versions within certain variables.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from AST nodes representing variable assignments and their string values, especially focusing on variables named in self.dependency_keywords.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful effects. The code does not perform any network operations, file writes, or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from variable assignment nodes in the AST to validation functions that check string formats based on predefined regex patterns. No external data sources or sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The code does not contain obfuscated logic or hardcoded secrets. It strictly performs pattern matching for dependency formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for checking dependency declaration formats in Python ASTs. It identifies specific variables holding dependency info and verifies their string formats using regex. No operations indicate malicious intent; it functions as a static code linter. There are no obfuscation techniques or malicious behaviors detected, and the code appears safe and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a static analysis tool for dependency formatting validation, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is well-structured for its purpose and does not exhibit suspicious or malicious features.",
