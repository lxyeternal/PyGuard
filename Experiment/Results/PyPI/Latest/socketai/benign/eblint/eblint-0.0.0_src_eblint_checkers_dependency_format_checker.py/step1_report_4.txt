{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to check the format of dependency specifications in Python AST nodes, likely for validation of package dependencies in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Reads data from AST nodes such as ast.Name and ast.Assign, specifically targeting dependency declaration structures.",
  "sinks": "Uses regex validation on dependency strings; no direct data sinks or external system interactions detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from AST nodes representing dependency strings through format validation functions; no untrusted external input or output involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are detected. Usage of regex patterns appears standard. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The script parses AST nodes to verify dependency names and versions against regex patterns. It stores variable references and checks formatted strings for correctness. The code operates purely in static analysis mode without any runtime data manipulation or external communication. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The focus is on dependency format validation, which is a benign and common task in code quality checks.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs static validation of dependency strings in Python code, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign dependency format checker.",
