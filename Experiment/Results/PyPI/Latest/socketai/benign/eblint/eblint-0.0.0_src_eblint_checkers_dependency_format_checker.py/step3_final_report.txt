  "purpose": "Static analysis tool to verify dependency package names and versions in Python AST nodes for correct formatting.",
  "sources": "Assignment targets in AST nodes, variable assignments, string literals representing dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; validation occurs within static code analysis without external data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Variable assignments to stored names, then to format validation functions using regex patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward static validation of dependency strings using regex, tracking variable assignments to resolve dependency declarations. It does not execute dynamic code, access external resources, or handle sensitive data. The regex patterns are simple and appropriate. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The code's purpose is solely to enforce dependency string formatting, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static dependency format checker with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its purpose and assign appropriate low scores for malware and security risk. The code poses no threat and functions as intended for static validation.",
