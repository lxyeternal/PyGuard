{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for checking the format of dependencies in a Python AST, ensuring package names and versions conform to specified regex patterns.",
  "sources": "Reading AST nodes for assignments, specifically target identifiers and their values; reading string values from AST nodes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not write data to external sources, execute commands, or handle untrusted data beyond reading AST nodes.",
  "flows": "AST assignment nodes are read to identify dependency declarations; stored variable names are used to validate dependency strings against regex patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors observed; code primarily performs format validation.",
  "analysis": "The code analyzes the structure of Python AST nodes to validate dependency strings against regex patterns for package names and versions. It tracks variable assignments to resolve references and checks for proper formatting. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling occurs. The logic is straightforward, with no suspicious behaviors or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs dependency format validation without any malicious intent or malicious behavior indicators. It is a utility for ensuring dependency strings follow expected formats, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
