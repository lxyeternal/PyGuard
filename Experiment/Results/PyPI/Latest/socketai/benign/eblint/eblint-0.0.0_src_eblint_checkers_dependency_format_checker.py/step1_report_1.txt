{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to check the formatting of dependencies in Python code, specifically verifying package names and version strings in dependency declarations.",
  "sources": "Reads dependency assignment targets (like 'dependencies' or 'builddependencies') and dependency list elements within those assignments.",
  "sinks": "Uses regular expressions to validate package name and version format, which is a benign operation. No other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Assignment targets for dependency keywords lead to storing or checking dependency list elements; string values flow into regex validation functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears to follow standard formatting checks without obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis of AST nodes to verify dependency formats. It stores variable names and checks string format using regex. The flow is straightforward, with no evidence of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors. It does not manipulate environment variables, execute dynamic code, or include suspicious library usage. The focus is solely on validating dependency string formats.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard dependency format checker with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs benign validation tasks and does not contain malware or malicious logic.",
