{
  "purpose": "A static code analysis tool that checks if the last field in an 'eb-config' file is a specific field, defaulting to 'moduleclass'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'last_field_name' parameter, and traverses AST nodes 'Name' and 'Module' to perform validation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "The code tracks the last visited 'Name' node and compares it at the end of module traversal to the expected last field name.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected. The logic is straightforward AST traversal for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for AST-based static analysis, specifically checking the last field in a configuration AST. It only uses standard AST node visits and comparison logic. No external data input, no network activity, and no code execution or obfuscation features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign static analysis for configuration validation. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
