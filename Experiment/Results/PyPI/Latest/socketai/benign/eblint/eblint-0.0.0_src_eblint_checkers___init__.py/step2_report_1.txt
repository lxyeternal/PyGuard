  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from internal modules/classes.\n- No data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling is observed.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1 and scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code snippet is purely import statements; there is no executable logic, data flow, or external interaction.\n   - No signs of malicious activity, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n   - **Confirmed:** No issues are present in this code snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Given the benign nature, these scores seem reasonable.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, there's no need for justification.\n   - The code is straightforward and does not pose any security threat.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code only imports internal modules/classes.\n   - No malicious behavior or code is present.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No false positives or unwarranted security concerns are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies observed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the simplicity of the code and the thorough, consistent analysis in all reports, I agree with the assigned scores. The code snippet is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current evaluations.",
