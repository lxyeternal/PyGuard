  "purpose": "The code imports internal modules/classes for a validation framework setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "Import statements serve as dependencies; no data flow or execution beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward import statements, with no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and internal module references do not present any security threats or malicious behavior. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed. The scores are consistent with the code content and analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and appropriate in their assessments. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
