  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, analyzing the evidence and reasoning provided, and cross-checking with the original code snippet.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports focus solely on import statements, which are straightforward and typical for Python modules.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.\n- The malware score in all reports is 0, which aligns with the absence of suspicious or malicious constructs.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with clear, standard import statements.\n- The confidence score is 1 in all reports, reflecting certainty based on the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and logical assessments:\n\n**Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \nYes. The reports correctly identify that the code consists only of import statements from local modules, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \nNo. The reasoning is sound; the code is simple and benign.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \nNone are needed here, as the code is purely import statements with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Malware score considerations:**  \nThe malware score is 0 in all reports, which is justified. No malicious activity is indicated or implied.\n\n**Claims based on assumptions:**  \nAll reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the import statements are standard and non-malicious.\n\n**Score consistency:**  \nAll scores are consistent with the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n  The code only contains import statements; no malware or malicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.0  \n  No security risks are apparent from the code.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this is a simple import block with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's content. No adjustments are necessary.",
