  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any potential concerns.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules.\n- No dynamic code, network activity, data processing, or external interactions are mentioned.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as just import statements, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent, no issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above, straightforward import statements, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** all zero, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same conclusion, no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** all zero, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as previous, no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** all zero, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same, import statements only, benign.\n- **Scores:** all zero, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify any actual issues in the code.\n- **Scores justification:** All scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n- **Potential for higher scores:** Since there is no evidence of malicious activity, code obfuscation, or security concerns, raising scores would be unjustified.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Final conclusion:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard set of import statements with no security risks or malicious intent. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the current assessments, confirming the benign nature of the code snippet.",
