  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports examine the same code snippet: a series of import statements from local modules.\n- The code contains no executable logic, data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- All assigned scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's content:\n\nThe code snippet is purely import statements:\n\n```python\nfrom .base_checker import Checker\nfrom .violation import Violation\nfrom .dependency_format_checker import DependencyFormatChecker\nfrom .field_order_checker import FieldOrderChecker\nfrom .last_field_checker import LastFieldChecker\nfrom .mandatory_field_checker import MandatoryFieldChecker\nfrom .default_checkers import DEFAULT_CHECKERS\n```\n\n**No processing, no dynamic code, no network activity, no untrusted data.** The code's purpose is to set up dependencies for a larger validation framework.\n\n---\n\n### Issues in the reports:\n\n- **Logical and factual accuracy:** All reports correctly identify that this code snippet is benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Scores assigned:** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is consistent with the code content and analysis.\n- **Risk scores > 0.5?** No, all are zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score justification:** Since no malicious activity is present, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score justification:** No obfuscation is present; all code is straightforward import statements.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** None, as the code is static and internal.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent across all reports.\n- No changes needed; the assessments are accurate.\n- The reports correctly challenge any unwarranted suspicion, emphasizing the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on all reports and the code:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the absence of malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **The code is a simple import block with no malicious or suspicious behavior.**\n- **All reports are accurate and consistent in their reasoning and scoring.**\n- **No further action or score adjustments are necessary.**\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
