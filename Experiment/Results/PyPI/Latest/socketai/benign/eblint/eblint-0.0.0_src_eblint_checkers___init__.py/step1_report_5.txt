{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various checker classes and constants related to dependency format, field order, and mandatory fields, likely for validation or analysis purposes within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statements retrieving classes and constants from local modules (.base_checker, .violation, .dependency_format_checker, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data handling or external system interaction observed; the code is solely importing modules",
  "flows": "N/A — No data flow or processing logic present, only import statements",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code consists of straightforward import statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of import statements from local modules. There is no executable logic, data processing, or untrusted input handling. The structure suggests it is part of a larger validation framework. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign and standard for importing dependencies in a Python module. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks based on the visible content.",
