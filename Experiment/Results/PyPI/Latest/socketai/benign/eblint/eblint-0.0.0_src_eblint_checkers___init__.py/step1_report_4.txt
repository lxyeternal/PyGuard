{
  "purpose": "The code imports multiple modules and classes related to checkers and violations, likely for a validation or linting framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules within the package",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or malicious activity identified",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; imports are static references",
  "anomalies": "All imports are from internal modules; no dynamic code execution or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, indicating modular design. There are no functions, classes, or dynamic behaviors that could be exploited. All imports are from relative internal files, which are typical for package internal organization. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and does not exhibit malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of import statements for internal modules, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, well-structured package intended for validation or checking purposes.",
