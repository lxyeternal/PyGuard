  "purpose": "Import statements for various modules and classes related to dependency checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Module import statements at the beginning of the file, importing local modules and classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only imports modules without executing untrusted data or actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution flows involving untrusted input; the code only establishes references to other modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The code appears to be straightforward import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, indicating setup for a larger application or package. No code execution, user input handling, or data processing occurs here. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activities. The structure is standard for Python modules importing dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple import section with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears benign and typical for Python code organization.",
