{
  "purpose": "This code defines several field checkers for validating the structure and order of fields in a larger data or configuration context.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code imports modules and uses hardcoded string values for field names and issue codes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output is performed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only initializes objects with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of class instantiations with static parameters. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes, then creates instances of these classes with predefined parameters, primarily string literals. There are no input/output operations, network activity, or executable commands. The purpose appears to be static validation of field order and presence, which is typical for configuration validation. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup for configuration validation with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any data processing, external communication, or system modifications. Overall, it is safe and benign.",
