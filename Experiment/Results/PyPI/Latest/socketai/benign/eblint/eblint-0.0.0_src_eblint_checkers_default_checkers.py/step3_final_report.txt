  "purpose": "Static configuration for package validation checkers, defining rules for mandatory fields and field order.",
  "sources": "Class instantiations with hardcoded parameters, no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A; static setup without data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class instantiations with static parameters. Minor typo in 'versionsuffixer' which appears to be a configuration detail.",
  "analysis": "The code imports validation classes and creates instances with predefined parameters, storing them in a collection. There is no dynamic data processing, input/output, network activity, or obfuscation. The code serves as static configuration for package validation, with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration setup for validation purposes. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are justified and accurate.",
