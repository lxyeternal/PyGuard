  "purpose": "Define default field checkers for package validation, including mandatory fields and field order checks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the current package/module.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or external data usage present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily configuration setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns. The code appears to be straightforward class instantiations and collection definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three classes and creates instances of field checkers with specific configurations. The field names and issue codes appear to be part of a validation framework, likely used for package or configuration validation. No input/output operations, network activity, or dynamic execution are present. The code does not include any obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious logic. All elements serve a clear purpose in setting up validation rules.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard setup for validation checkers with no malicious intent or security risks. It is purely configuration-oriented and does not perform any harmful actions.",
