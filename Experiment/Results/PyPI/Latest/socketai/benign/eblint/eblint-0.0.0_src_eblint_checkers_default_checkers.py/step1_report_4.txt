  "purpose": "Define and configure field checkers for validating package metadata or configuration fields.",
  "sources": "Import statements for checker classes; creation of checker instances with specific parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is read from or written to untrusted sources within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Import of checker classes -> instantiation of checkers with specified field names and parameters -> aggregation into a dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes, then creates instances of these classes with fixed arguments such as field names and issue codes. It then stores these instances in a set for later use. There are no input handling, no network or file operations, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns present. The code's purpose appears to be structural and configuration in nature, not performing any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is solely for defining validation checkers with predefined fields and issue codes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is benign.",
