  "purpose": "A static analysis tool (linter) that reads a Python source file, parses it into an AST, applies external checkers, and prints violations.",
  "sources": "File input via command line argument, reading source code from disk.",
  "sinks": "Printing violations to stdout; no untrusted data sinks or external data flows.",
  "flows": "Source (file input) to AST parsing, then to checkers, then to printed violations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward, standard implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static analysis utility that reads a Python source file, parses it into an AST, applies external checkers, and prints violations. It does not perform network activity, dynamic code execution, or system modifications. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The checkers are external and not provided, but their usage appears safe. The code structure is standard and clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward static analysis tool with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk are justified and accurate. The reports correctly assess the code as safe, and no modifications are necessary.",
