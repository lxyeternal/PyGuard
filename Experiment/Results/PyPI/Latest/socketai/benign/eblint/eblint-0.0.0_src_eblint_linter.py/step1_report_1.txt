{
  "purpose": "A simple Python linter that uses AST parsing to check source code for violations based on customizable checkers.",
  "sources": "Reads source code from a file specified via command line argument; loads checkers from an imported module.",
  "sinks": "Prints violation messages to standard output; no data is sent over the network or stored persistently.",
  "flows": "Reads filename from sys.argv -> opens and reads file -> parses code into AST -> runs checkers -> prints violations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code patterns. The code uses standard Python libraries and a straightforward design.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic linter framework, parsing source code with ast and applying checkers. No untrusted input handling beyond file reading, and no external network or system modifications are present. It does not contain obfuscated code or dynamic execution, and there are no suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign linter tool designed for code analysis with no malicious intent or malicious behavior evident. It relies on external checkers, which are not provided, but the core code is straightforward and safe.",
