{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python linter that analyzes source files for violations based on custom checkers.",
  "sources": "Reads source code from a file specified via command-line argument.",
  "sinks": "Prints violation messages to standard output; no data leaks or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads source code from file -> parses to AST -> checkers analyze AST -> violations printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures detected. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a Python source file, parses it into an AST, applies a set of checkers to identify violations, and prints violations. The checkers are external and not detailed here, but the flow is standard for static analysis tools. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code functions as a typical linter utility, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign static analysis tool with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It only reads and analyzes source files, reporting violations via printing. No malicious behavior or security threats are identified.",
