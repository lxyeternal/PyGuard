{
  "purpose": "The code defines a static analysis checker to ensure mandatory fields are present in Python code by inspecting AST nodes.",
  "sources": "The code reads AST nodes, specifically variable name nodes and the module node during traversal.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink of untrusted data or external system interaction present.",
  "flows": "AST node traversal from module to variable names, collecting declared fields, then verifying against required fields.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; the code appears to be standard static analysis logic.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a class for static code checking, inheriting from a base Checker. It records variable names assigned in the module and verifies that specified mandatory fields are declared. The use of AST nodes and generic visit methods is typical for static analysis tools. No data leakage, external communication, or malicious behavior is present. The logic is straightforward and does not perform any unsafe or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a benign static analysis checker for mandatory fields. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be standard, safe, and intended for code quality enforcement.",
