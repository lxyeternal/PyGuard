{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for checking the presence of mandatory fields in an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) representation of Python code.",
  "sources": "Code reads the AST nodes, specifically looking at variable names in the AST, during the visit of Name and Module nodes.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit data sinks in this code; it only records violations based on the presence or absence of certain field names.",
  "flows": "The code flows from visiting Name nodes to recording variable names, then upon visiting the Module node, it checks whether required field names are present and reports violations if missing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The code structure is straightforward and typical of AST-based checkers.",
  "analysis": "This code functions as a static code analysis tool, inspecting the AST to ensure specific variable names are defined. It records variable names when they are assigned (via ast.Name nodes with Store context). When the module is fully visited, it verifies whether all mandatory fields are present; if not, it reports violations. The logic is simple, transparent, and does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign static analysis utility with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply checks for the presence of specific variable names in the source code. There are no suspicious activities or potential supply chain attacks.",
