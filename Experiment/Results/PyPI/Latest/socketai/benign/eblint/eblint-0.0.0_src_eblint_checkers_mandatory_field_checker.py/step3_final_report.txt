  "purpose": "Checks for the presence of mandatory variable fields in a Python module by traversing the AST and reporting missing fields.",
  "sources": "Variable names assigned in the module (via visit_Name with ast.Store context).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not process external inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A - static analysis only; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static analysis logic, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static analysis class that records variable names assigned during AST traversal. After traversal, it verifies whether all specified mandatory fields are present among the recorded names, reporting violations for any missing. The logic is simple, correct, and does not perform any network, file, or external operations. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is limited to static code compliance checking, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard static analysis task without malicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
