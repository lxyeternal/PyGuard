  "purpose": "Define a data structure for representing code violations with an AST node and message.",
  "sources": "None; no input reading or data collection occurs in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is solely defining a class.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard Python constructs with no unusual or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'ast' module and defines a 'Violation' NamedTuple with two fields: 'node' of type ast.AST and 'message' of type str. No input, output, external calls, or dynamic behavior is present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be a simple data structure definition used for static analysis or reporting purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class definition for representing violations in code analysis, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any data processing or external interactions. Overall, it is benign and secure.",
