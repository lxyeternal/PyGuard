  "purpose": "Defines a data structure for representing code violations with an AST node and message",
  "sources": "No input sources; code is a static class definition",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no data processing or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flow; only a class definition with no executable logic",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definition with no suspicious elements",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'ast' and 'NamedTuple' to define a simple data structure 'Violation'. It contains no executable logic, data input, or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be part of a larger static analysis framework or tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard class definition intended for use in static code analysis or linting processes. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
