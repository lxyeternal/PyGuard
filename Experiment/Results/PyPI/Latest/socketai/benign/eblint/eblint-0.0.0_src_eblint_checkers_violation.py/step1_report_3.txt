{
  "purpose": "Define a NamedTuple class 'Violation' to store an AST node and a message, likely for code analysis or reporting purposes.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'ast' module and the 'NamedTuple' class from 'typing'. No data input or external sources are read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points where untrusted data could be used or leaked; the code does not process external input or execute code.",
  "flows": "The code does not establish data flow from sources to sinks; it only defines a data structure.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated or unusual constructs. No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a simple data structure 'Violation' intended to store an AST node and a message. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or execution of untrusted code. The structure is typical for static analysis tools or linters to record code violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard definition of a data container class used in static analysis. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are present.",
