{
  "purpose": "Define a data structure 'Violation' to hold AST nodes and associated messages, likely for code analysis or static checking.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'ast' and 'NamedTuple' from 'typing'",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; the code only defines a class without executing any logic or processing input",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no anomalies, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious patterns; it is a simple class definition",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a NamedTuple 'Violation' with two fields: 'node' of type 'ast.AST' and 'message' of type 'str'. It appears to be part of a static analysis tool or a code quality checker. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no input handling, no external data processing, and no suspicious operations. The code is clean, simple, and intended for defining a data structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign class definition used likely for code analysis or static checking purposes. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
