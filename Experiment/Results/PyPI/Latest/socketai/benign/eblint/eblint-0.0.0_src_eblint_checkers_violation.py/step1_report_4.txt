{
  "purpose": "This code defines a data structure (Violation) using NamedTuple to represent violations with associated AST nodes and messages.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and lacks any suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'ast' module and 'NamedTuple' for defining a structured data type. It defines 'Violation' with two fields: 'node' (an AST node) and 'message' (a string). There are no input/output operations, network communications, or code execution patterns. The code appears to be part of a larger static analysis or linting tool for Python code, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, straightforward, and serves as a data container for reporting violations during static analysis. There are no indicators of malware or security issues.",
