  "purpose": "Defines a simple data structure 'Violation' for static analysis or linting purposes, encapsulating an AST node and a message.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definition with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "None; static data structure with no data flow or execution path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definition with clear structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal class using NamedTuple to store an AST node and a message. It contains no executable logic, input/output, or external dependencies. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security issues are present. The code is intended for static analysis or reporting, which is benign. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No suspicious patterns, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a data container for static analysis results. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
