  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low malware and obfuscation scores, but reports indicating obfuscation and dynamic execution justify higher suspicion. Adjusted scores reflect a cautious stance, with an overall malware score around 0.4, obfuscation around 0.45, and security risk approximately 0.65, aligning with the evidence of suspicious patterns in specific reports."
