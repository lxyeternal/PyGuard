  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with no immediately obvious malicious intent. Its purpose is to perform some computational task or data processing, but specific details are not provided.",
  "sources": "Data inputs may originate from user input functions (e.g., input()), environment variables, or external files/read operations, but no explicit sources are evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network requests, or data output functions such as print(), file writes, or subprocess calls, but no such operations are clearly present.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit source-to-sink data flows identifiable in the code snippet provided. Without additional context or code, flow analysis is limited.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are evident. The code structure appears straightforward and typical of benign scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code shows no signs of obfuscated logic, malicious behavior, or security issues. It appears to be a normal Python script, with no external library usage indicating malicious activity. No data leakage, code injection, or backdoor mechanisms are apparent from the provided snippet. The absence of suspicious functions or network activity further reduces concern. Due to limited context, a low-confidence assessment is made, but no red flags are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no anomalous or suspicious features observed.",
