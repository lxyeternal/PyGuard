{
  "purpose": "This code defines a static code analysis checker class for validating the order of fields in a configuration file based on a specified sequence and mode (strict or regular).",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes, method parameters, and AST nodes during the traversal of Python code's abstract syntax tree.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data leaks are present; the code does not perform network operations, file writing, or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code primarily processes AST nodes to track field definitions and order, without data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code uses standard Python features and the AST module without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from a checker base, with methods to visit AST nodes of type 'Name' to verify field order. It maintains internal state for seen fields and their indices, raising violations if order constraints are violated. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration. The code solely performs static analysis logic related to configuration field ordering.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate static analysis tool designed to enforce field order in configuration files. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The logic is straightforward and safe.",
