{
  "purpose": "The code defines a static analysis checker class for verifying the order of fields in an 'eb-config' file, ensuring fields are in the correct sequence based on the mode (strict or regular).",
  "sources": "The class reads the AST nodes of Python code, specifically targeting 'Name' nodes to identify variable names that represent field identifiers.",
  "sinks": "The code does not interact with external systems, network, file I/O, or execute untrusted data. It only generates violation reports internally based on AST analysis.",
  "flows": "The source flow is from the AST nodes representing variable names; the flow is to the logic that checks their order and records violations if order rules are violated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalous or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The code uses standard Python AST traversal and exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static analysis utility that inspects Python AST nodes to enforce ordering constraints on configuration fields. It employs standard AST node processing and exception handling for missing fields. The class operates solely within static code analysis and does not perform runtime or external actions. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code are detected. It functions purely as a code quality and consistency checker.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign static analysis utility designed for checking configuration field order. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. The design is straightforward and safe.",
