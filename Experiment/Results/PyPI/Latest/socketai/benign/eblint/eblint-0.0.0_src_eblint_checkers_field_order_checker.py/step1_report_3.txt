{
  "purpose": "This code defines a static code analysis checker for verifying the order of fields in a configuration file, ensuring they follow specified ordering rules.",
  "sources": "The code reads the class attributes, method parameters, and AST nodes such as 'Name' nodes during AST traversal.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as data output, network calls, or file writing are present; the code only performs in-memory analysis and violation collection.",
  "flows": "The code processes AST nodes to detect field order violations based on internal stored state; no external data flow or untrusted input handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no signs of obfuscation or hidden behavior. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code execution, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a static analysis tool, inspecting AST nodes for specific variable names and their order. It manages internal state to detect order violations and reports violations accordingly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code relies solely on in-memory data structures and standard AST traversal methods. It does not perform any I/O, network communication, or manipulate system resources beyond reporting violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate static analysis component designed to check configuration field order, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It operates within its defined scope and does not introduce security risks.",
