{
  "purpose": "The code defines a static code analysis checker for verifying the order of fields in an 'eb-config' file, ensuring correct sequence and strict ordering if enabled.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes, method parameters, and local variables; notably, 'node.id', 'self.ordered_fieldnames', 'self.seen_ordered_fields', and 'self.seen_ordered_fields_indices'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data influences security-sensitive operations, external data leaks, or system commands.",
  "flows": "The code processes AST nodes to track field names and their order, generating violations if order rules are violated; no data flow to external systems or insecure operations is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code uses standard AST processing and class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a static analysis checker that inspects AST nodes representing variable names to verify their order against a predefined sequence. It tracks the order of field definitions and raises violations if fields are out of order in strict mode. No external data handling, network operations, or secret management is present. All class and method structures appear standard, and no malicious patterns such as code injection or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate static analysis tool designed for configuration file validation. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It operates solely on AST nodes for static code analysis purposes.",
