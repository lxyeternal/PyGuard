{
  "purpose": "Define a placeholder Python package named 'execjs' with basic metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "setuptools import, setup() function call with metadata fields",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code is static and straightforward",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is a standard setup script with no suspicious elements",
  "analysis": "The script imports the setuptools library and calls setup() with static, hardcoded package metadata. No user input, external data, or dynamic code execution is involved. The package description indicates it is a security placeholder, and there are no embedded scripts, network operations, or credential handling. The code is minimal, well-structured, and typical for Python package distribution. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a simple placeholder package configuration.",
