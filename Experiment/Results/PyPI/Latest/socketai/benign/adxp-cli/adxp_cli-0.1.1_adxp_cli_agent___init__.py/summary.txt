  "conclusion": "The majority of the code appears benign with low security risks, except for Report 5, which exhibits signs of obfuscation and potential malicious behavior. The scoring reflects this, with a slightly elevated malware score (~0.3-0.4), obfuscation (~0.6), and risk (~0.5). The reports are consistent and justified; further code inspection is recommended for suspicious reports."
