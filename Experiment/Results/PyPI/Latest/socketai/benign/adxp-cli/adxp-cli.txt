      "conclusion": "The code is safe in its current state, with no active malware or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the presence of commented-out code with hardcoded secrets, which could pose a risk if reactivated without proper security measures. Overall, the security risk is low, and the code functions as intended without malicious intent."

      "obfuscated": 0.7,
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their low to moderate risk assessments. The presence of obfuscation and dynamic code execution features suggests a need to slightly increase malware scores (from 0.2 to 0.3) in reports 3 and 5. The overall security posture remains low to moderate, with no definitive malicious actions detected. Adjustments improve alignment with observed suspicious patterns, ensuring a more accurate security assessment."

      "conclusion": "The majority of the code appears benign with low security risks, except for Report 5, which exhibits signs of obfuscation and potential malicious behavior. The scoring reflects this, with a slightly elevated malware score (~0.3-0.4), obfuscation (~0.6), and risk (~0.5). The reports are consistent and justified; further code inspection is recommended for suspicious reports."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is generally safe and performs legitimate automation tasks. The main security concern is the absence of input validation for configuration parameters embedded into commands and Dockerfiles, which could be exploited for command injection. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score should be set around 0.45 to reflect the potential injection vulnerability. Addressing input validation would mitigate this risk further."
