{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for managing an AIP server, integrating commands from the agent module.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'click' and 'adxp_cli.agent_cli', and execution of the CLI in the main block.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the CLI command in the '__main__' block, which triggers command-line parsing and command execution.",
  "flows": "User runs the script -> '__main__' block executes -> 'cli()' is invoked -> commands from 'agent' are executed based on user input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'click' library for command-line interface creation and an 'agent' command group from a local module. It defines a CLI group and adds the 'agent' command to it, then runs the CLI when executed as a script. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The structure is standard for CLI tools. There are no embedded secrets, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution. All imported modules appear legitimate and relevant to CLI operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that integrates an agent command group. It exhibits no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The structure and imports are standard and benign.",
