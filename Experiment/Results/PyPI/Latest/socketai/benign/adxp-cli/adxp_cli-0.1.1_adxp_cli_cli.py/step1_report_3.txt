  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no user input handling or external data writing observed.",
  "flows": "N/A; code primarily sets up CLI commands without processing untrusted data or executing external code based on input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code features detected. The code is straightforward CLI setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a command group using the 'click' library. It adds the 'agent' command to the CLI group and executes the CLI when run as main. There are no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a standard CLI entry point for a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. Overall, it appears safe.",
