  "purpose": "Command-line interface for managing AIP server, integrating the 'agent' command group.",
  "sources": "Imports 'click' and 'adxp_cli.agent_cli.agent'; defines CLI group and adds 'agent' command.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file operations; standard CLI setup.",
  "flows": "Defines CLI group, adds 'agent' command, executes CLI in main block; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper using 'click', importing a local 'agent' module. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. The 'agent' module's content is unknown, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The structure is standard, and no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
