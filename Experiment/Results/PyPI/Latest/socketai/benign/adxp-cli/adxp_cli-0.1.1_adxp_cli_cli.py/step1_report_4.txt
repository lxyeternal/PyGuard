  "purpose": "Provide a command-line interface for managing the AIP server via the 'agent' command.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'click' library and 'agent' from 'adxp_cli.agent_cli'. No user input sources detected within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "Execution of CLI commands; invoking 'agent' command as part of the CLI.",
  "flows": "CLI invocation flow: script execution triggers 'cli()', which includes 'agent' command; no untrusted data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Usage of 'click' is standard for CLI creation. No obfuscated or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a command-line interface using the 'click' library, defining a 'cli' group and adding an 'agent' command. The script executes 'cli()' if run directly. No dynamic code execution, external data reading, or suspicious behaviors are present. The imported modules appear standard for CLI applications. No malicious or security-risk code elements detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a straightforward CLI setup with a command group and an 'agent' command. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks in this snippet.",
