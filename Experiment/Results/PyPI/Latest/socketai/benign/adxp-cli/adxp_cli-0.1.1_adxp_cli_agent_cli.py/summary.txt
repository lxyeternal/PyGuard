  "conclusion": "The code is safe in its current state, with no active malware or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the presence of commented-out code with hardcoded secrets, which could pose a risk if reactivated without proper security measures. Overall, the security risk is low, and the code functions as intended without malicious intent."
