  "purpose": "This code provides CLI commands for managing an agent server, generating Dockerfiles, building Docker images, and interacting with external APIs for deployment and authentication.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line options (e.g., --host, --port, --graph_yaml, --tag, --dockerfile), file reading (e.g., Dockerfile, graph YAML, env files), environment variables, and external API calls (requests.post/get for login and deployment).",
  "sinks": "File writes (Dockerfile, config validation output), network requests (API login, deployment, API key management), and subprocess calls for invoking CLI commands.",
  "flows": "Input options or files are processed and validated; network requests are made with user-provided tokens or credentials; deployment or build commands send data over the network; file outputs and subprocess invocations follow.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains commented-out sections related to login and deployment, including hardcoded credentials ('admin', 'aisnb') in commented code (not active). These are potential security concerns if activated. No active hardcoded secrets are present in current code. External API interactions are typical but could be exploited if tokens are compromised; however, no suspicious behavior detected. No obfuscated or malicious code found.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical CLI interface for managing servers and Docker images with functions for validation, file generation, and external API interaction. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or system damage mechanisms are present. The presence of commented code with hardcoded credentials is noted but inactive; if activated, it could pose security risks. External requests use tokens obtained through login, but tokens are not hardcoded, reducing immediate risk. The code is well-structured, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscated logic. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate management tools with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI management script for deploying and managing an agent server and Docker images. No active malicious behaviors or sabotage are detected. The only minor concern is the presence of commented-out code with hardcoded credentials, which should be cleaned or properly secured before use. The overall security risk is low.",
