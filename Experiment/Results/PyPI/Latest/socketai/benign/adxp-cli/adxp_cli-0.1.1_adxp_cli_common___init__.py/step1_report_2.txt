  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a Python script intended to perform a certain task, possibly related to data processing or system interaction, but the exact purpose is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, files, or network sockets; user inputs; or system parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, subprocess calls, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user inputs through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks like network transmission or file output.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials, use of dynamic execution (eval or exec), obfuscated variables, or unusual import patterns. Any unneeded or complex code structures without clear purpose also raise suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly. No evidence of obfuscated code or standard compilation artifacts. Usage of third-party libraries seems appropriate. No clear malicious patterns such as sending data externally, reverse shells, or backdoors were detected. However, any presence of hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution, would warrant closer inspection. The overall structure indicates typical functionality, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. Limited context constrains absolute certainty, but based on visible code, risks appear low.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not demonstrate malicious intent or security risks based on current analysis. No indicators of malware or malicious data flow are evident. The security risk score remains low, but vigilance with hardcoded secrets is advised.",
