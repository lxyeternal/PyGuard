  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Any code reading input, environment variables, network calls, or data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system modifications, environment variable access, or data output points.",
  "flows": "Sources leading to sinks via data processing, network calls, or dynamic execution pathways.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity, or unusual data handling.",
  "analysis": "Given the absence of actual code, the review relies on provided summaries. Reports 1 and 2 show no evidence of malicious activity, with low malware and obfuscation scores and low risk, consistent with their descriptions. Report 3 indicates minor anomalies such as obfuscation and suspicious network activity; increasing malware score from 0.1 to 0.2 better reflects this suspicion. Report 4 describes signs of dynamic execution, untrusted data flows, and obfuscation, justifying higher scores (malware 0.4, obfuscated 0.4, risk 0.6). Report 5 depicts benign code with high confidence, low scores. Overall, scores are aligned with descriptions, with slight adjustments for reports 3 and 4 to better match their suspicion levels.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their scores; minor increases in malware scores for reports 3 and 4 improve alignment with described anomalies. The overall assessment indicates low to moderate suspicion, with no confirmed malicious code. Vigilance is recommended if further code details emerge.",
