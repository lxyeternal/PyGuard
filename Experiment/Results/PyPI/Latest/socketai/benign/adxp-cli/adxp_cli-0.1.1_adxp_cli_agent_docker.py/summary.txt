  "conclusion": "The code is generally safe and performs legitimate automation tasks. The main security concern is the absence of input validation for configuration parameters embedded into commands and Dockerfiles, which could be exploited for command injection. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score should be set around 0.45 to reflect the potential injection vulnerability. Addressing input validation would mitigate this risk further."
