  "purpose": "Load and validate a YAML configuration file for the langgraph tool using a defined schema.",
  "sources": "Reads filename input, opens and reads the YAML file from disk.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only local file access and data validation.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> open file -> parse YAML -> validate with Pydantic -> return config object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file reading and data validation using standard libraries. No network activity, code execution, or obfuscation is present. The only potential concern is reading files based on user input, which is typical for configuration loaders and does not imply malicious intent. The validation process is safe, and no vulnerabilities are evident. The malware score is appropriately zero; the risk score should be very low (~0.1) due to standard file handling, but not indicative of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard configuration loader with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The existing scores overstate the security risk; a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a minimal risk score (~0.1) are justified.",
