  "purpose": "Define configuration structure and validation for a graph YAML file used in a package.",
  "sources": "Reading 'graph_yaml' filename input from the user (not explicitly shown, but implied by usage of open), loading YAML content from file.",
  "sinks": "Opening and reading files from the filesystem using the filename provided by the user.",
  "flows": "User provides 'graph_yaml' filename -> File is opened and read -> YAML content is parsed and validated into a data model.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. Usage of 'open' with filename could be misused if filename is from untrusted input, but this is standard for configuration loading.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models for configuration using Pydantic and YAML, and a function to load and validate a YAML config file. It relies on file input and validation, with no network activity, no execution of untrusted code, and no suspicious logic. The only point of potential concern is the reading of files based on user input, but this is standard practice for configuration files and does not indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code snippets.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard configuration loading and validation without any malicious behavior. No malware or security risks are evident beyond typical file handling operations, which are not inherently malicious.",
