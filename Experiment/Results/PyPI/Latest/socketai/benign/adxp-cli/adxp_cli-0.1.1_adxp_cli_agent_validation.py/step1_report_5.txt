  "purpose": "Define data structures and validation functions for reading and validating a YAML configuration file related to a graph package.",
  "sources": "Reading the file specified by 'graph_yaml' parameter in 'validate_graph_yaml' function.",
  "sinks": "Opening and reading the specified YAML file; no other data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "File path input 'graph_yaml' -> reading and parsing file -> validating with Pydantic model.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behaviors; standard validation and file reading.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models with Pydantic for configuration validation, reads a YAML file, and validates its contents. There are no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration. The file reading operation is straightforward and secure. No obfuscated code or malicious intent is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs typical configuration validation without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard implementation for configuration parsing with proper validation.",
