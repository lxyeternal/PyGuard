  "purpose": "Define a configuration schema for a graph-related YAML file and validate its contents.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'graph_yaml' filename as an argument, opening and reading the YAML file from disk.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, but file operations could lead to file access issues if paths are maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> open file -> parse YAML -> validate data -> return config object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no hidden network activity, and no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles file I/O and data validation using Pydantic models and YAML parsing. It reads a filename, opens and reads the YAML file, then validates its structure against a defined schema. No user input is directly processed beyond filename input; the operations are standard configuration handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors. The exception handling provides user feedback if validation fails. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration loader and validator with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It does not pose security risks beyond typical file handling concerns, which are unrelated to malicious activity.",
