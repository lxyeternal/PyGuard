{
  "purpose": "The code provides an asyncio-based utility for executing subprocess commands with signal handling, stream monitoring, and optional output collection, suitable for asynchronous process management.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters (e.g., 'input' string), subprocess stdout and stderr streams, and system signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM).",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted command arguments (cmd, args), but not directly used insecurely; subprocess outputs are collected but not transmitted externally within this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> subprocess creation -> signal handlers -> stream monitoring -> output collection or display -> process termination and cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Signal handling is platform-specific but standard. No external network activity or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured asyncio utility managing subprocess execution with platform-aware signal handling and stream monitoring. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious code. Signal handlers are correctly set and reset, subprocess cleanup is handled properly, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The code's logic aligns with safe subprocess management practices, and no vulnerabilities or malicious intents are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure utility for asynchronous subprocess execution with proper signal handling and stream monitoring. It poses minimal security risk and contains no malware or obfuscation. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and risk score (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
