  "purpose": "Provides functions for verifying Python version and managing Docker credentials by saving and loading them from a JSON file.",
  "sources": "Reading from sys.version_info, checking existence of '.docker_auth.json', reading from '.docker_auth.json' file",
  "sinks": "Writing credentials to '.docker_auth.json' file, reading credentials from '.docker_auth.json' file",
  "flows": "get_python_version() uses sys.version_info; save_docker_credentials() writes to file; load_docker_credentials() reads from file",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code; functions perform straightforward file read/write and version check",
  "analysis": "The code performs a Python version check and manages Docker credentials by saving/loading them to/from a JSON file. The version check is benign. The credential handling functions read/write a JSON file named '.docker_auth.json' and raise errors if credentials are missing. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code is simple, direct, and does not include obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard utility code for version validation and credential storage with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It correctly handles credentials with simple file operations, assuming the environment is secure.",
