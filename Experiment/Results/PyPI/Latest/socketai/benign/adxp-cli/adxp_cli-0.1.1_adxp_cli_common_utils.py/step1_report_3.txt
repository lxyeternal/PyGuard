  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for Python version validation and Docker credential management, including saving and loading credentials to/from a JSON file.",
  "sources": "Reading system version info (`sys.version_info`), checking file existence (`os.path.exists`), reading from and writing to `.docker_auth.json`.",
  "sinks": "Reading from `.docker_auth.json`, writing to `.docker_auth.json`.",
  "flows": "get_python_version() uses sys.version_info; save_docker_credentials() writes credentials to a file; load_docker_credentials() reads credentials from the file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or obfuscation detected. Credentials are stored in plaintext in a local file, which may be insecure but not malicious. The code comments are in Korean, which is unusual but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version checks and manages Docker credentials through local JSON files. It does not execute untrusted input, does not connect to external networks, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs. The credential storage approach is insecure in terms of best practices but not malicious. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate utility code for version checking and credential storage. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The only concern is insecure storage of credentials, but that alone does not qualify as malicious.",
