{
  "purpose": "The code validates Python version compatibility and manages Docker credentials through plaintext JSON files.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version info from sys.version_info; reads and writes credentials from/to .docker_auth.json file.",
  "sinks": "File I/O operations for reading and writing credentials; no untrusted data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Version info is checked at the start; credentials are saved and loaded via file operations, with no external data flow or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "Plaintext storage of credentials is insecure; comments are in Korean, which is unusual but not suspicious; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment validation and credential management using straightforward file operations. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The main security concern is insecure plaintext storage of credentials, which is a security weakness but not malicious. The version check is standard and restricts Python versions appropriately. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are found. The code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators justify a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) due to insecure credential storage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with a minor security concern regarding plaintext credential storage. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
