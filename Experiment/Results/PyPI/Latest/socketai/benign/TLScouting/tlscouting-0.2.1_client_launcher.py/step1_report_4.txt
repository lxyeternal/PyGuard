{
  "purpose": "Initialize and run a Qt-based graphical user interface application.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), imported modules (PyQt6.QtWidgets, .main.ClientApp).",
  "sinks": "app.exec() (starts event loop), sys.exit() (exits application).",
  "flows": "sys.argv -> QApplication -> app.exec() (starts and maintains GUI event loop).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no suspicious imports or functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for a PyQt6 application, creates an application instance, initializes a custom ClientApp widget, displays it, and runs the event loop. The code structure is standard for a GUI app and contains no signs of malicious activity or unusual behavior. No external data sources, network calls, or suspicious code are present. The import of a relative module '.main.ClientApp' indicates a local component, but this alone is not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup for a GUI application with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard in design.",
