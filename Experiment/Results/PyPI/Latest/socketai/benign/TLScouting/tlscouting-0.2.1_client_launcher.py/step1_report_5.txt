  "purpose": "Initialize and run a PyQt6 GUI application by creating an instance of ClientApp and starting the event loop.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, import of ClientApp from a local module",
  "sinks": "app.exec() which runs the GUI event loop; no external data sinks or network interactions present",
  "flows": "sys.argv -> QApplication -> ClientApp -> app.exec() (event loop initiation)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward GUI application startup code with no suspicious or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and PyQt6.QtWidgets, initializes a QApplication with command-line arguments, creates a ClientApp instance, displays it, and runs the event loop. There are no hardcoded credentials, network connections, or obfuscated segments. The module import is relative, but this is typical for structured applications. No signs of malicious behavior or unusual code behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard GUI application startup script without any malicious intent or security concerns. It simply initializes and runs a PyQt6-based client application.",
