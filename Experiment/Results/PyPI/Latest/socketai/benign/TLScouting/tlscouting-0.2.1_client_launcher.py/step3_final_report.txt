  "purpose": "Initialize and launch a PyQt6 GUI application with ClientApp.",
  "sources": "sys.argv passed to QApplication, import of ClientApp from relative module",
  "sinks": "app.exec() starting the event loop, no external data or network activity",
  "flows": "sys.argv → QApplication, ClientApp instance creation → show() → app.exec()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard PyQt6 application bootstrap. It imports sys and QApplication, initializes the application with command-line arguments, creates and shows a ClientApp instance, and starts the event loop with app.exec(). No external network activity, data leaks, or dynamic code execution are present. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to typical patterns. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The import of a relative module .main is common in modular applications and not suspicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard PyQt6 application startup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores for malware and obfuscation are correct at 0. The security risk score should be set to 0 across all reports, as there is no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity. Overall, the code is safe and poses no security threat.",
