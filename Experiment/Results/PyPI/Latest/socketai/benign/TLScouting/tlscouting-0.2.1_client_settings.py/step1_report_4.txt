  "purpose": "Manage application settings by loading and saving configuration data from a TOML file in the user's config directory.",
  "sources": "Reading the settings file with 'load_settings' and the initial existence check of SETTINGS_FILE.",
  "sinks": "Reading data from the settings file, constructing a URL string using host and port from settings.",
  "flows": "load_settings reads the file, returns data; get_server_url uses this data to generate a URL.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no suspicious dynamic execution; straightforward file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration data from a file in the user's config directory. It writes default settings if the file does not exist. The data is used to build a server URL. There are no external inputs from untrusted sources besides the config file, which is a controlled environment. The functions are standard for configuration management, with proper directory creation and safe file handling. No malicious payload, data leaks, or backdoors are evident. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration management implementation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It reads and writes configuration files safely, and generates a server URL from trusted settings.",
