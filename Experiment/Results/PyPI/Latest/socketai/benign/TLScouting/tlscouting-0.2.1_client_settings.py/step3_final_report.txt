{
  "purpose": "Manage application configuration via a settings file, providing load, save, and URL generation functions.",
  "sources": "Reading from the settings.toml file, accessing configuration data in load_settings(), and constructing URL in get_server_url().",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted outside local file operations and URL construction from trusted config data.",
  "flows": "load_settings() reads from SETTINGS_FILE; get_server_url() uses loaded data to generate URL; save_settings() writes to SETTINGS_FILE.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and handles only local files and data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code manages configuration files safely, with no external input processing or network activity. It reads and writes local files, constructs URLs from trusted data, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code. The small security risk score (0.1) in some reports accounts for potential local file access issues but is overly cautious given the code's simplicity. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero, aligning with the absence of malicious or obfuscated code. Overall, the code is benign, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe configuration management utility with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
