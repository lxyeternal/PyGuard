{
  "purpose": "Manage application settings by loading from and saving to a TOML configuration file.",
  "sources": "Reading the settings file (load_settings), checking file existence, and directory creation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is used directly in security-sensitive operations or external commands.",
  "flows": "Read settings from file -> use in get_server_url function; Save settings to file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code; uses standard libraries and well-known packages; no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes default settings, loads settings from a configuration file, creates directories as needed, and constructs a server URL. The use of 'pathlib', 'tomli', and 'platformdirs' indicates standard, secure practices for configuration management. No user input is directly processed, no external network communications are initiated, and no secrets or credentials are stored or transmitted. The logic is straightforward and follows typical patterns for configuration handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard configuration management functions securely with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
