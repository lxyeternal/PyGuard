  "purpose": "Manage application configuration settings, including loading and saving server details.",
  "sources": "Reads from settings.toml file, specifically when loading settings; writes to settings.toml during save.",
  "sinks": "Potentially exposes settings data if accessed by untrusted sources; writes configuration to disk.",
  "flows": "load_settings reads from settings.toml; get_server_url calls load_settings and uses returned data to construct URL; save_settings writes settings to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code patterns; uses standard libraries for file handling and configuration management.",
  "analysis": "The code reads and writes configuration data to a user-specific settings file. The functions are straightforward, using standard libraries without any obfuscation or suspicious code. No external data sources or network activity are present. The logic is to persist and retrieve server configuration details, which is typical for application setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The code follows common patterns for configuration management in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard configuration handling code with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations. Overall, it appears safe for use.",
