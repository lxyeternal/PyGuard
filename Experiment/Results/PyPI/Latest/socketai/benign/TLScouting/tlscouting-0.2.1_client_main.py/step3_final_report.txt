{
  "purpose": "A GUI application for managing a university catalog, performing CRUD operations via server API calls, with features like search, export, and settings management.",
  "sources": "User input from search bar, form fields in dialogs, and server API functions (search_catalog_entries, create_catalog_entry, update_catalog_entry, delete_catalog_entry, ping_server).",
  "sinks": "Display of results in QTableWidget, CSV file writing for export, and server communication for CRUD operations.",
  "flows": "User inputs trigger API calls; search results populate the table; create/update/delete functions modify server data; export reads all entries and writes to CSV.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Usage of standard libraries and API functions appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward PyQt GUI for catalog management, utilizing standard patterns for UI, server communication, and file I/O. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are present. Error handling is typical, and data flow is transparent. External API functions are assumed safe; no signs of malicious intent or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, legitimate, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. Security risk is minimal, primarily due to reliance on external APIs and standard operations. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The security risk score should be lowered from 0.95 (in Report 1) to near zero, consistent with the analysis.",
