  "conclusion": "The code is benign, legitimate, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. Security risk is minimal, primarily due to reliance on external APIs and standard operations. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The security risk score should be lowered from 0.95 (in Report 1) to near zero, consistent with the analysis."
