  "purpose": "Client library functions for server API interaction and configuration management",
  "sources": "Reading configuration file, calling get_server_url(), performing HTTP requests (requests.get, requests.post, requests.delete)",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests sending data to server, retrieving responses; potential data exfiltration if get_server_url() is malicious",
  "flows": "Configuration load -> get_base_url() -> HTTP request functions -> server responses",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code; reliance on external get_server_url() without validation",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration loading from a file, constructs URLs, and makes HTTP requests for CRUD operations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The only external dependency, get_server_url(), could pose a risk if malicious, but no evidence suggests so. The network interactions are typical for API clients. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign analysis. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward client for server API interactions, with no malicious intent or activity. The low risk score appropriately reflects minimal concerns, primarily about external dependency trust. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
