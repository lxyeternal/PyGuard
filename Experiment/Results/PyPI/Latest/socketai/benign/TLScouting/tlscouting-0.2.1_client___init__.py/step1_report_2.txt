  "purpose": "Importing the ClientApp class from the local main module and defining the package version.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main import ClientApp; assignment of __version__",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; no data processing or transmission occurs",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs; minimal code with no evident malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import and a version string assignment. There are no input sources, no sinks, and no data flows. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present. The import may be part of a larger package structure, but on its own, it shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing basic import and version declaration with no indication of malicious activity or security concerns.",
