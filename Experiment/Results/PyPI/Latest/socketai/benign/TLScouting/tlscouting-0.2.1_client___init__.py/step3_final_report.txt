{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a minimal module setup, importing a class from a local module and setting a version string, typical for package initialization.",
  "sources": "The relative import from .main and the assignment of __version__",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external communication, or dynamic code execution present",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows or untrusted data propagation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and version assignment with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing only a relative import and setting a version string. No data processing, external communication, or dynamic execution occurs. The import is standard for internal package structure. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, representing typical package initialization. All reports correctly identify this, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
