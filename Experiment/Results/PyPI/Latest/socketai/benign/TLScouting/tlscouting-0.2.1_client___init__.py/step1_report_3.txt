  "purpose": "Defines a module version and imports a ClientApp class from a local main module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing ClientApp from a local module, and the __version__ string assignment.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data input or output points.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external input or untrusted sources; the code merely sets a version string and performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple import and assignment statements with no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and assigns a version string. There are no dynamic code executions, no use of environment variables, no hardcoded credentials, and no network operations. The import is relative but standard in Python packages. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is apparent from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a basic module setup with versioning and a local import. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
