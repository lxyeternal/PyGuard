{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define the version of a Python package and imports a class named ClientApp from a local module named main.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' and the import statement 'from .main import ClientApp'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code segment, as it does not process or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets a version string and imports a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. The import is relative, which is normal for package internal structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, setting a version string and importing a class. It does not execute any code, handle input, or perform actions that could be malicious. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious intent. It is standard for package initialization files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, typical for a package's __init__.py or module setup, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
