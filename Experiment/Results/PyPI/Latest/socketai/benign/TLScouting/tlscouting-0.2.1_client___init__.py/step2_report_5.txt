  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify their assessments.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal, benign module that sets a version string and imports a class from a local module.\n- No sources, sinks, or data flows are identified, which aligns with the code snippet.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code is typical for a package's __init__.py or setup module.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues:**  \n   The code does not contain any malicious code, dynamic execution, or data handling. The import is relative but standard.  \n   **Confirmed:** No issues are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as benign and standard. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - *Obfuscated:* 0 — correct, as code is straightforward.  \n   - *Malware:* 0 — correct, no malicious behavior.  \n   - *SecurityRisk:* 0 — correct, no security concerns.  \n   \n   The scores seem appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n   Since all assessments point to benign, standard code, there is no justification for higher scores. The code does not execute untrusted data, does not perform network operations, nor contains obfuscation or malware.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct. No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and structure.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores align well with the analysis. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \nGiven the code's simplicity and the reports' consensus, I concur with the current scores. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is benign, standard package initialization code, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
