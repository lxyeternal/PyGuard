  "purpose": "Import the ClientApp class from a local module and define the package version.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports a local class.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets a version string and imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no apparent anomalies or obfuscated constructs. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, which is standard practice. It also defines a version string. No external data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior are observed. The simplicity and lack of malicious code or obfuscation suggest it's benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module setup with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a simple, benign initialization snippet.",
