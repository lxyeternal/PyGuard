  "purpose": "The code snippet is a package initialization comment with no executable code or suspicious behavior.",

  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only a comment present.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code; no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet contains only a comment indicating package initialization, with no executable code, data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the lack of code and activity, assigning low or zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The confidence scores vary but are generally low, reflecting the minimal evidence. The package name suggests potential malicious intent, but without actual code, this remains speculative. Overall, the snippet appears benign, and the scores are appropriate given the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this comment snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The package appears to be a placeholder or initial stub. Scores should be set to malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Further review of the full package code is necessary to confirm its safety.",
