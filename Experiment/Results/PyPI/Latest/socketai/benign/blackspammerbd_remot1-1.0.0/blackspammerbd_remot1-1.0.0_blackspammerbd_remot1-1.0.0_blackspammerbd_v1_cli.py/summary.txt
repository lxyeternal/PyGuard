  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score is appropriate, with the minor concern being the use of non-cryptographic randomness for code generation, which does not constitute a security threat. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score around 0.2 is justified. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
