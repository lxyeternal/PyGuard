  "purpose": "CLI tool for generating, verifying connection codes, listing files, and encoding/decoding files with Base64.",
  "sources": "Input parameters from command-line arguments (commands and filenames), reading and writing to 'connection_code.txt', reading file contents for encoding/decoding.",
  "sinks": "File system operations (reading/writing files), console output, Base64 encoding/decoding functions.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> command functions -> file read/write operations, Base64 encode/decode, print outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random module for code generation without cryptographic strength, no explicit input validation for filenames, no network activity, no suspicious obfuscation or hardcoded secrets, straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a CLI utility to generate, verify, list, encode, and decode files. It uses standard libraries and common practices. The connection code is generated with 'random.randint', which is not cryptographically secure but not malicious per se. Files are read and written securely with specified encodings, and no untrusted data is sent over the network or stored externally. The command handling is standard. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The overall structure is clear, with no obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward CLI utility for file encoding/decoding and connection code management, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or data leaks, and no obfuscation is evident. The security risk level is low, with no immediate threats identified.",
