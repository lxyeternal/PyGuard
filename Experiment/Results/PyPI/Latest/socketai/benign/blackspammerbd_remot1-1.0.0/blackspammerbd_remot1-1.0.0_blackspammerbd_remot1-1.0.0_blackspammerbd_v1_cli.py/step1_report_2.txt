{
  "purpose": "A CLI tool to generate, verify connection codes, list files, and encode/decode files using Base64.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments, the 'connection_code.txt' file, and files specified for encoding/decoding.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are file writes ('connection_code.txt', encoded/decoded files), console output, and reading from files.",
  "flows": "Code reads input from command-line arguments and files; outputs encoded/decoded data and status messages to console and files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Use of random for code generation is acceptable. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward file operations, Base64 encoding/decoding, and simple code generation for connection codes. It does not include network activity, suspicious external communications, or obfuscated logic. The code reads from and writes to files based on user input and uses standard libraries. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious payloads, and no hidden functionalities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI utility for file encoding, decoding, and connection code management. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a basic implementation with minimal attack surface.",
