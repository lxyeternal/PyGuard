  "flows": "Uses package discovery and dependency specifications; no input/output flows that could be malicious.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'blackspammerbd_remot1' is suspiciously similar to spam or malicious naming conventions. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard setup tools.",
  "analysis": "The setup script is a typical configuration for a Python package, importing setuptools, defining package info, dependencies, and entry points. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The package's name and URL might warrant further scrutiny, but the code itself does not contain malicious behavior. No obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks within the code itself. The suspicious package name could be a concern outside the code, but as per the code review, it is benign.",
