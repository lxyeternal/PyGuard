  "conclusion": "The setup script itself is benign and standard. The main concern is the package's name and intended functionality, which could be exploited if the 'cli' module contains malicious code. No malicious activity is detected in this code; however, caution is advised when executing the CLI. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily based on context and naming, not code content."
