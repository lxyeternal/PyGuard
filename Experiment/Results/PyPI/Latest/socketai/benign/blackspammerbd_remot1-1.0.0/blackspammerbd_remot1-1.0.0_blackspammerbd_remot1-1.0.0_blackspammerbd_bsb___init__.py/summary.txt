  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of a comment. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The package name alone does not justify increased risk. Scores are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Confidence levels should be proportional to evidence, and high confidence in the absence of code is acceptable. No further action needed unless additional code or context is provided."
