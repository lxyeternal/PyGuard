The main concern is the package's name and intended functionality, which could be exploited if the 'cli' module contains malicious code. No malicious activity is detected in this code; however, caution is advised when executing the CLI. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily based on context and naming, not code content."

It does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be approximately 0.3 to reflect the security concerns without implying malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of a comment. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The package name alone does not justify increased risk. Scores are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Confidence levels should be proportional to evidence, and high confidence in the absence of code is acceptable. No further action needed unless additional code or context is provided."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score is appropriate, with the minor concern being the use of non-cryptographic randomness for code generation, which does not constitute a security threat. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score around 0.2 is justified. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."

It does not exhibit obfuscation or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is moderate (~0.3) due to plaintext transfer and weak randomness."
