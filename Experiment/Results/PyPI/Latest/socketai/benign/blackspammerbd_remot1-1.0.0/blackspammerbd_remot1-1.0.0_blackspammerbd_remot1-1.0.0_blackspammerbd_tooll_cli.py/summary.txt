  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for remote device connection and file transfer, with known security limitations but no malicious intent or payloads. It does not exhibit obfuscation or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is moderate (~0.3) due to plaintext transfer and weak randomness."
