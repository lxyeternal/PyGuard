  "sources": "No sources; the snippet contains only a comment with no data input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, network activity, or output points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the snippet does not include executable code or data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the snippet is a simple comment with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is solely a comment line with no executable code, functions, data handling, or network interactions. All reports correctly identify the absence of code and malicious behavior. The package name 'blackspammerbd_v1' suggests potential malicious intent, but without actual code, this remains speculative. Malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are appropriately low (all zero or near zero). Confidence in benign assessment is high, but the lack of code limits definitive conclusions. The minimal content indicates no security issues or malicious activity in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, containing only a comment. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. Scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low risk score (~0.1) reflecting the package name's potential but unsupported suspicion. The reports are accurate; no further action is necessary based on this snippet.",
