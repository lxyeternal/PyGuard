  "purpose": "A Flask server providing file listing, upload, download, and connection validation endpoints without authentication.",
  "sources": "request.get_json() for connection_code, item, data; os.listdir('.'); open(item); base64.b64decode(file_data); request data for connection_code, item, data",
  "sinks": "open(item, 'rb') and open(item, 'wb') for file access; base64 encoding/decoding for data transfer",
  "flows": "client sends connection_code -> server validates; client requests file list -> server reads directory; client uploads data -> server decodes and writes file; client downloads file -> server reads and encodes",
  "anomalies": "No validation on file names; no authentication; unrestricted file access; no security controls; no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code implements an open file server with minimal validation, allowing arbitrary file access and modification. It uses base64 encoding for data transfer, with no authentication or access control, which poses security risks. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The lack of validation and controls makes it vulnerable to misuse, but the code itself is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malware or obfuscation but presents a high security risk due to unrestricted file operations and lack of access controls. The malware score should be 0, and the obfuscated score should be 0. The security risk score is approximately 0.75, reflecting the significant security concerns stemming from insecure design.",
