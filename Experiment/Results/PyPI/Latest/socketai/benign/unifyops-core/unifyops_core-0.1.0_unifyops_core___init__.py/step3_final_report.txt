  "purpose": "Minimal module header containing version information and descriptive comments for UnifyOps Python projects.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; only static strings and comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no external data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; code is static and non-executable.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of functions, data processing, or external interactions; no suspicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static module header with a version string and a descriptive comment. No functions, data processing, input/output, or external interactions are present. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are identified. The code's minimal nature and lack of dynamic or external elements confirm its benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code content. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a placeholder or metadata for a Python package. There is no malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive content. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
