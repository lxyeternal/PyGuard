  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Indicators**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is purely a module header with a version string and descriptive comments. There are no functions, data processing, input/output, or external interactions. No suspicious or malicious constructs are identified.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is minimal and benign. No logical errors or flaws are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since the code is straightforward and lacks any obfuscation.  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the absence of any security-sensitive operations.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is entirely benign, the risk score should remain at 0. No justification exists for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's content.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's content, which is minimal and harmless.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a simple, static module header with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. It is clearly benign.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify that the code is harmless, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are appropriate and justified. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.",
