  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of a module docstring, a version string, and comments.\n   - No functions, data processing, external data handling, or dynamic execution are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and purely descriptive.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is minimal and contains no security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Assigned to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`, `obfuscated`, and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code content.\n   - The `confidence` score is 1 across all reports, reflecting certainty.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present, higher scores are unwarranted.\n   - The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is accurate.\n   - No evidence suggests malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward code inspection, with no assumptions about hidden behavior.\n   - The assessments are appropriate.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores align well with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n\n**Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a minimal, benign module with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Note:** If this were part of a larger project, continued vigilance is recommended, but based solely on this snippet, it’s safe.",
