  "purpose": "Define shared utilities for UnifyOps Python projects, including version information.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs as the code only sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a module docstring and a single variable assignment setting __version__ to '0.1.0'. It contains no dynamic execution, external input handling, or suspicious constructs. The code appears to be a standard module header for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to provide a version identifier and a descriptive comment for a shared utilities module. No malicious intent or security issues are detected.",
