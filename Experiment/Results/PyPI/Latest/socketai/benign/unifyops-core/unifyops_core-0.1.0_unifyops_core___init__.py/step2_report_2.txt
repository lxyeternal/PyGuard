  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or vulnerabilities:**  \nAll reports consistently indicate that the code is purely a minimal module header containing only a docstring and a version variable. There are no functions, data processing, external input/output, or any logic that could be exploited or that indicates malicious intent.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \nThe reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns, no obfuscated code, and no security risks. There are no logical flaws or misinterpretations in their assessments.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n- **Malware:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the straightforward, readable code.  \n- **SecurityRisk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the lack of any security issues.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \nNo issues warrant a risk score above 0.5; the code is clearly harmless.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \nSince no malicious activity is detected, the malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \nAll reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as a simple module header with no external interactions or suspicious patterns.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is entirely benign, serving only as a placeholder or metadata for a Python package. No further security concerns are identified.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is harmless, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The current scoring and analysis are correct.",
