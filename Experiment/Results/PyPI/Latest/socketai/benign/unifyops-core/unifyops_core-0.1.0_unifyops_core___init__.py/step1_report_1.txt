  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks due to lack of code logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; only a module docstring, version variable, and comment",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a module docstring describing the purpose, a version string, and a comment. There are no functions, input/output operations, data processing, or any logic that could indicate malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be a minimal placeholder or initial module description without any executable or potentially harmful elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is harmless, containing only descriptive comments and a version variable. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
