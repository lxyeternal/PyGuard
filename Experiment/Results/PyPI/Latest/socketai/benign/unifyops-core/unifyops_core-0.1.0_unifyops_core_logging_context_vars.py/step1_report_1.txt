{
  "purpose": "This module manages context variables for request tracking, correlation IDs, and metadata across asynchronous operations, primarily for logging and tracing.",
  "sources": "Code reads default values of ContextVars via .get() methods and input parameters in functions such as set_correlation_id, add_metadata, and set_trace_context.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks found in the code. There are no data leaks, network transmissions, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (correlation_id, trace_id, span_id, metadata) are set into ContextVars, which are retrieved later for logging or tracing purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated elements. Functions perform straightforward context management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines context variables for managing request metadata and tracing information. Functions to set and get correlation IDs, add metadata, and set trace context are simple and safe. No data is transmitted externally, no sensitive information is hardcoded, and no insecure operations are present. The use of ContextVars is standard for async context propagation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard context management module for logging and tracing purposes. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
