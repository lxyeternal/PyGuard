{
  "purpose": "This module manages context variables for request tracking, correlation IDs, and metadata, primarily for logging and traceability in asynchronous workflows.",
  "sources": "The code reads from context variables: correlation_id_var, metadata_var, trace_id_var, span_id_var.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that send untrusted data outside the process; the code only sets and gets context variables.",
  "flows": "Input (set_correlation_id, add_metadata, set_trace_context) → stores data in context variables; get functions retrieve this data for use elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code present. Use of contextvars for tracking is standard. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several ContextVar objects for request tracking and metadata management, with functions to set and retrieve these values. It uses standard Python features for context management and does not perform any external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious operations. No anomalies or security risks are apparent. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose for request tracing and logging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for context management in asynchronous Python applications, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to facilitate request tracking and logging.",
