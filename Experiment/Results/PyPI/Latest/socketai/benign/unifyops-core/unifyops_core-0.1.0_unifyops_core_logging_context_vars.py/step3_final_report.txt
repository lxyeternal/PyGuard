  "purpose": "Manage request context, correlation IDs, trace IDs, span IDs, and metadata across asynchronous boundaries for logging and request tracking.",
  "sources": "Functions setting or retrieving context variables: set_correlation_id, get_correlation_id, add_metadata, get_metadata, set_trace_context.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; in-memory context variables are used without external data flow.",
  "flows": "Input functions (setters) update ContextVars; getter functions retrieve current context data; add_metadata merges new data into existing metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple ContextVar objects with default values and provides functions to set and get these variables. It operates entirely in-memory, with no external communication or data leaks. The functions are standard for managing request context in async Python applications. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for context management in asynchronous Python environments. It poses no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
