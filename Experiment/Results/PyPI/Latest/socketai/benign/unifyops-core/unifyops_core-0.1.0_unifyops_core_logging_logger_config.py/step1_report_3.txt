{
  "purpose": "Configure centralized logging for the UnifyOps application, supporting different environments and formats (console or JSON) based on environment settings.",
  "sources": "Reading environment settings (settings.ENVIRONMENT, settings.LOG_LEVEL, settings.LOG_STYLE, settings.SERVICE_NAME, settings.VERSION, settings.LOG_RETENTION_DAYS)",
  "sinks": "Logging output to stdout, potentially formatted as colorized console or JSON, and suppression of uvicorn logs via NullHandler",
  "flows": "Environment settings -> Decide formatting style -> Configure handlers and formatters -> Apply logging configuration",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; environment variables are read via settings module, which appears standard",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging based on environment variables, selecting between console and JSON formats, and suppressing certain uvicorn logs. It uses standard Python logging configuration practices, including custom formatters. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present. The only point of concern could be reliance on external 'settings', but this is typical for environment configuration. The logging configuration does not perform any network activity or data exfiltration. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging configuration setup with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It correctly manages logging behavior based on environment settings without any suspicious activity.",
