  "purpose": "Configure centralized logging for the application, supporting console and JSON formats based on environment and settings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables and settings module for ENVIRONMENT, LOG_LEVEL, LOG_STYLE, SERVICE_NAME, VERSION, and LOG_RETENTION_DAYS.",
  "sinks": "Logging configuration that outputs to stdout or null handler; no data sinks that could leak data or execute malicious code.",
  "flows": "Settings are read and used to configure log handlers and formatters; the configuration is applied via dictConfig.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated code detected. Use of dynamic class instantiation is standard for formatters. No suspicious input or external data flows observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads configuration from environment/settings variables to set up logging handlers and formatters, then applies this configuration via logging.config.dictConfig. It uses standard logging library features and custom formatters. No user input, external data, or untrusted sources are involved in the configuration process. No network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are present. The only potential issue is the handling of log levels, but this is a standard practice and does not pose a security risk. The code appears to be a typical logging setup with no malicious intent or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging configuration setup with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It solely manages application logging behavior based on environment variables and settings, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
