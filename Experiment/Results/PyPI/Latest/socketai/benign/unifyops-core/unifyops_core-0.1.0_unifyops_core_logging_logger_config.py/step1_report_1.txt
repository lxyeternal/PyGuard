  "purpose": "Configure centralized logging for the UnifyOps application based on environment and settings, supporting console and JSON formats.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'app.config', 'app.logging.formatter', and environment variables via 'settings'.",
  "sinks": "logging configuration applied through 'logging.config.dictConfig' which sets up handlers and formatters.",
  "flows": "Settings are read to determine handlers and formatters, then passed into 'dictConfig' to set up logging handlers and formatters for the application.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; all logic pertains to configuring logging based on environment variables and settings. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The use of 'dictConfig' for setting up handlers is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration settings to determine logging style, level, and environment. It defines handlers, formatters, and loggers accordingly. The 'configure_logging' function applies these settings. The code appears to be a straightforward, standard logging configuration script without any signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or sabotage. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical logging configuration setup with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It dynamically configures logging based on environment variables and settings, using standard Python logging practices. No malicious activity or sabotage is detected.",
