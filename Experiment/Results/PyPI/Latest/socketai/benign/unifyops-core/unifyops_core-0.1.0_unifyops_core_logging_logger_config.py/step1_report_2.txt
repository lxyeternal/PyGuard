  "purpose": "Configure centralized logging for the UnifyOps application, supporting different environments and styles (console or JSON).",
  "sources": "Imports modules (logging, settings), reads environment variables and settings attributes (ENVIRONMENT, LOG_LEVEL, LOG_STYLE, SERVICE_NAME, VERSION, LOG_RETENTION_DAYS).",
  "sinks": "The logging system outputs logs to stdout or null handlers; configuration is applied via logging.config.dictConfig.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters are derived from settings, then used to set up handlers and formatters, and finally applied with logging.config.dictConfig.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code only configures logging based on environment variables/settings. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and reads configuration parameters from a 'settings' object, which could be environment-driven. It sets up logging handlers with formatters (colorized console or JSON) based on environment and style settings. The configuration dictionary is standard for Python logging and includes safe handlers and formatters. The 'configure_logging' function applies this configuration safely with exception handling for invalid log levels. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data leaks, or secret exfiltration. All operations are related to logging setup and do not involve untrusted input handling beyond standard configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code only sets up logging based on environment settings and does not contain malicious behavior or malware. It appears to be a legitimate configuration script for centralized logging. No suspicious or malicious code is detected.",
