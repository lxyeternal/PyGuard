  "purpose": "Configure centralized logging settings for the application, supporting environment-specific formats and log levels.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules (logging, logging.config, app.config, app.logging.formatter). Reads environment and settings variables.",
  "sinks": "Uses logging.config.dictConfig to set up logging handlers and formatters. No untrusted data sink identified.",
  "flows": "Settings variables -> Logging configuration dictionary -> logging.config.dictConfig call",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The code only manages logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and reads configuration from environment and settings variables. It determines logging style based on environment, sets handlers and formatters accordingly, and applies configuration via dictConfig. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows are present. The configuration is standard for logging setup and does not involve untrusted input processing beyond reading environment variables, which are expected in deployment contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging configuration module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It dynamically sets up logging handlers and formatters based on environment, but does not process untrusted data or execute suspicious operations.",
