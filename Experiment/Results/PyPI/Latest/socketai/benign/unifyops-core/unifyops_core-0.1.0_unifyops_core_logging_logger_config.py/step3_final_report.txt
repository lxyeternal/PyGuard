  "purpose": "Configure centralized logging for the application, supporting environment-specific formats and levels.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (ENVIRONMENT, LOG_LEVEL, LOG_STYLE), settings module, imported formatters.",
  "sinks": "logging.config.dictConfig applies configuration; no external data sinks or untrusted inputs are used.",
  "flows": "Settings influence formatter choice and log level; handlers direct logs to stdout or null; configuration applied via dictConfig.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution. Use of custom formatters is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward logging setup that adapts to environment variables and settings. It uses standard Python logging practices, custom formatters, and exception handling for invalid log levels. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The reliance on external 'settings' is typical for environment-based configuration and does not introduce security issues. The code does not obfuscate or execute untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard logging configuration module with no malicious or suspicious elements. It effectively manages logging styles and levels based on environment settings, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
