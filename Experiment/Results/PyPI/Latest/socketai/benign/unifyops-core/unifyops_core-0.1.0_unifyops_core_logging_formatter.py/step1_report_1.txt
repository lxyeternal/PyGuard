{
  "purpose": "The code provides custom logging formatters for enhanced log output, including colorized console logs and structured JSON logs for production, with utility functions for stack inspection.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (APP_ROOT), inspect.stack(), log record attributes (pathname, lineno, levelname, custom_metadata, created, etc.)",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no direct data exfiltration or malicious data handling observed",
  "flows": "Log record creation and formatting flow, with potential source-to-sink paths involving log data and environment variables",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no code injection or insecure data handling identified",
  "analysis": "The code implements custom logging formatters that modify and enhance log outputs for development and production environments. It inspects the call stack to identify application code locations, rewrites file paths for clarity, and colorizes logs for readability. The environment variable APP_ROOT controls path rewriting behavior. The formatters generate structured JSON logs compatible with DataDog, adding ISO timestamps and preserving metadata. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows are present. Usage of environment variables and stack inspection are standard practices and do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is focused on logging enhancements without any harmful or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of custom logging formatters intended to improve log readability and structure. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code operates within standard practices and does not pose supply chain threats or data leaks.",
