{
  "purpose": "The code provides custom log formatting classes for enhanced and structured logging, including colorized console output and JSON-formatted logs for production systems.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('APP_ROOT', 'NO_COLOR'), filesystem paths, and logging record attributes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data, no network or file writing in this code segment.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and filesystem paths are used for path rewriting; logging records are formatted for output, no untrusted data flows to external systems within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code follows standard practices for logging customization and environment handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom formatters: LevelColorFormatter for development with colored output, and JSONFormatter for structured logs in production. It includes functions to identify application code frames, manipulate log record paths, and format logs with metadata. No indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are present. Usage of environment variables for configuration is typical. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or hidden operations are evident. The code appears well-structured, purpose-specific, and aligns with standard logging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is legitimate, focusing on enhancing logging output and formatting. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected based on this snippet.",
