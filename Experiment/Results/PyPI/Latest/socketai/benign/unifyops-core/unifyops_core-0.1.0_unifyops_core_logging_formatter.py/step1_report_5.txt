{
  "purpose": "This code provides custom logging formats and utilities for Python applications, including colorized console output and structured JSON logs for production environments.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (APP_ROOT), inspect.stack() for call stack analysis, and record attributes for formatting.",
  "sinks": "Formatted log output to console or log files, with potential insertion of custom metadata into logs.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and inspect.stack() provide input data; format functions process and potentially modify record attributes before output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution; no malicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on enhancing log readability and structure. It reads environment variables for configuration and inspects the call stack to modify log record paths. The formatting functions alter log record attributes for better presentation but do not execute untrusted code or perform network operations. No hidden or malicious behavior detected; the code is straightforward in its purpose. All modifications are related to log formatting, with no apparent data exfiltration or backdoor mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for improved logging. It does not contain malicious logic, malware, or security risks. It is designed to improve log clarity and structure without impacting system security or privacy.",
