{
  "purpose": "To provide a structured logging system for FastAPI applications with features such as context-aware logging, correlation ID tracking, environment formatting, structured logs, metadata enrichment, and distributed tracing support.",
  "sources": "The code imports components from various modules within 'app.logging', including context, context_vars, logger_config, and logger_utils. It also creates module-level references and re-exports them.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily imports and re-exports functions and constants; no direct data sinks are evident. There are no evident points where untrusted data is written or transmitted maliciously.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could lead to leaks or malicious actions. The code sets up logging utilities and configuration variables without processing external input.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only import statements, re-exports, and documentation; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements, variable assignments, and re-exports aimed at establishing a logging utility module. No input reading, data processing, or network communication occurs. There are no signs of malicious code or suspicious behavior. All components are standard for setting up logging infrastructure. The absence of dynamic code execution, external data handling, or secret management indicates low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup for a logging system in a FastAPI application. It only imports, re-exports, and documents components, with no evidence of malicious activity, malware, or security vulnerabilities.",
